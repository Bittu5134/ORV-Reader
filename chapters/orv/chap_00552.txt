<title>Ch 552: Side Story Announcement

Dear Readers,

Thank you for accompanying us through the journey of Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint.

After 551 chapters, Kim Dokja's main story has come to a close with "Epilogue 5 - The Eternity and Epilogue (Complete)". However, this is not the end of our story.

***

The world of ORV continues beyond what we've witnessed. There are countless other world-lines, countless other Kim Dokjas, and countless other stories waiting to be told.

As Han Sooyoung once said:

<&>「This story is for just that one reader.」

But what if there were more readers? What if there were more stories?

***

The continuation begins with a new perspective, a new narrator, yet still firmly rooted in the world you know and love.

Starting from Chapter 553, we invite you to explore the Side Story of Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint - a tale that is not outside the main story, but an essential part of it.

This story is still the story of Kim Dokja, but it's not for just one Kim Dokja.

***

We hope you'll join us as we continue this journey.

The story that was never meant to end will now truly never end.

See you in Chapter 553.

<?> Note: This is a transition chapter between the main story (Chapters 1-551) and the Side Story/Continuation (Chapters 553+). The Side Story introduces new perspectives while remaining faithful to the original narrative.
