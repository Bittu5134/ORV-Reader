<title>705 Episode 26 Star Ladder (1)
With Yoo Jonghyuk's roar, the atmosphere of the battlefield changed. The frightened incarnations began to leave the battlefield one by one.
<!>[Someone uses the 'star ladder'!]
<!>[Someone uses the 'star ladder'!]
This scenario was a 'sub-scenario' and did not necessarily need to be cleared.
"Wait a minute, you guys—"
Because they didn't come here to protect Washington in the first place.
"I’m sorry, Prophet."
As the allies she trusted disappeared one by one, Anna Croft's expression became anxious.
The 'star ladder' in the sky continued to emit bright light.
"Anna."
Selena Kim and Christina stood by her side. Her colleagues also knew that there was no chance of victory at this rate.
Anna and Zarathustra's elites have already completed the subjugation of the 4 grade disaster species. They could also use that star ladder if they wanted to.
Nevertheless, Anna did not leave the scenario.
If she abandons Washington, America will collapse. The invasion of the demon world will continue and eventually hit Las Vegas.
As the representative of 'Zarathustra', she had a duty to protect this continent.
"Cheon Inho."
Anna Croft looked at me.
She was so desperate that she had to resort to her least favorite scammer.
"I will stop it. Instead—"
So, now was the only time for the scammer to set a 'condition'.
"Please lend me some of your skills."
"Which..."
"I know you have the 'Elixir Maker' trait."
The real reason I came to see Anna Croft.
I took out the ´Lesser Dragon Heart' from her arms. A reward obtained from defeating a 4th grade earth dragon.
However, because the processing process for Dragon Heart is so complicated, there is currently only one way to refine it into an elixir.
"I need your blood."
It is to mix it with the blood of the 'elixir manufacturer'.
A startled Anna Croft stared at me closely and said.
"You know what happens if you drink my blood."
"I will become a member of your household."
I said this, recalling Kim Dokja from the third round, who was revived after drinking Anna's blood.
"But that’s when I’m of a lower rank than you."
"Are you saying your level is higher than mine now?"
Certainly, when I looked at me now, I was insignificant.
I do not have a solid embodiment like Yoo Jonghyuk, nor does I have powerful mental skills like Nirvana.
I do not lead a powerful group like Anna, nor do she have a sponsor that everyone knows about.
But there is one thing I am confident about.
<!>[Story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is hungry.]
'Stories.'
"How can you—"
Anna's eyes widened as she sensed the story flowing from my body.
It has to be that way.
Because I have already collected three stories. And exactly in those three stories, there was a clear difference in class between me and the other incarnations.
"We don’t have time. What are you going to do?"
Anna Croft still seemed hesitant.
The fact that her 'blood' is an elixir is still a top secret. The moment this fact is revealed, incarnations from all over the world will target her.
So for her to display this ability in front of me now was already a gamble.
Anna, who was worried, eventually received the Dragon Heart.
"It will take about 5 minutes. You are confident, right?"
I stepped in front of her with my back to Anna.
"Of course."
Yoo Jonghyuk, trampling on  Nirvana, was crying towards the sky.
<!>[The attribute 'Cyclic Delay' is activated.]
I slowly took a breath and circulated the magical energy throughout my body.
—Youngest.
'Yes. Is it possible now?'
<!>[Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint’s cooldown has already ended.]
<!>[Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint 'Stage 3' is in effect!]
The problem was probability.
Even if Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint was at level 3, it was not completely free from the influence of probability.
—Is it possible.
But it's different now.
I knew it instinctively.
Like when Yamata no Orochi descended on [Peace Land], the 'probability aftermaths' do not blow in their normal form in this scenario.
In other words, this scenario works by putting each other's status on the 'scale' and canceling out each other's probabilities.
Then.
<&>「This time, we may be able to use the true power of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.」
I activated [Incite] at the right time.
<&>「I am Kim Dokja.」
<!>['Incite' goes hand in hand with 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint'!]
<!>[The synchronization rate with the sponsor is increasing!]
It feels like a layer of film is being placed on my soul, like wearing hard yet soft clothes.
As I slowly blinked, the scenery of the world changed. The high sky became even lower, and the gaze of the constellations felt more blatant.
<!>[Some constellations are surprised by your status! ]
<!>[The constellations of the National Tree pay homage to your status .]
<!>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is surprised as to whether you actually have hidden powers.]
<!>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is looking closely at your story.]
<!>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' looks at you with his eyes wide open.]
Christina, who was standing a few steps away, stumbled.
As for her, if she really is an 'apostle', she will have no choice but to recognize who is possessing me now.
"As expected of you…"
Finally, Yoo Joonghyuk looked this way. The moment our eyes met, I knew the bastard would move.
"Come, Yoo Joonghyuk."
At the same time as control of the body was transferred to Kim Dokja, 'Unbreakable Faith' flashed in the air.
Yoo Jonghyuk's flying front foot and the brilliantly rising 'Blade of Faith' collided with each other.
Coo coo coo coo!
The blade and forepaw collided and a loud noise erupted.
I was taking the attack from that monstrous beast.
—Woah! Are you that surprised? Even if I look like this, I am fable grade'.
I realize it again.
That playful 'neighborhood brother' is actually a shining 'constellation' in the sky.
—I cannot properly use even 10% of my power in this incarnation.
To be exact, even that '10%' was difficult.
The muscles of my entire body were screaming, and I could feel my magic power quickly depleting in real time.
—The decision will be made within 5 minutes.
The tale began to tell its story on Kim Dokja’s behalf.
<!>[The story 'King of a Kingless World' begins its storytelling !]
The first story obtained by Kim Dokja, the 'Demon King of Salvation'.
<&>「No king under the heavens of this world can call himself true.」
The 'King of a Kingless World' was declaring to the 'Supreme King'.
<&>「Only the king who denies the king will exist.」
The power of the story exploded and I kicked the ground and ran. I felt confident that I could cut down anything that got in my way.
'Blade of Faith’ expanded explosively.
For the first time, a hint of confusion appeared in the eyes of that scary beast.
Sugagak.
The cut off black fur fluttered in the air and blood splattered. Yoo Jonghyuk's stance, which was focused on attack, was changing.
A cautious defensive stance centered on [Strong Self-Defense].
In that brief moment, the beast made a decision. This 'story' cannot be used for very long.
'Is it smart?'
Even Yoo Jonghyuk was instinctively suppressing the story of the 'Supreme King'.
As if he knew that the moment he used that story, 'King of Kingless World' would be used.
All he uses are 'beast' techniques that rely solely on instinct.
—I don’t know if Yoo Jonghyuk is smart or if the demon possessing him is smart.
The story of 'King of a Kingless World' was spreading in real time.
As he expected, my incarnation body could not maintain the power of a legendary story for long.
'What should I do now?'
—We have to use other means.
Other means?
The moment I was about to ask what else there was, a message rang in my head.
A sigh flowed from within.
This is the technology that made 'Kim Dokja' into a 'reader'.
He defeated numerous enemies with this technique and absorbed their power as his own.
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]
In my head, I ran through a list of countless characters that Kim Dokja had read about so far.
Some characters I knew, some I didn't even know.
Some characters were too weak to be appropriate for use at the moment, while others were so strong that it was impossible to know if probability would allow it.
—There are people to choose from.
However, there was no hesitation in Kim Dokja's choice.
<!>[Bookmark number 11 has been activated!]
—If this guy is the '41st round', there is someone who must be chosen.
I felt like the magical energy in my whole body was shaking violently and I got goosebumps.
I realized who I had become.
<&>「The pure white coat was covered with white fur.」
I never thought I would see this scenery with my own eyes.
<!>[Bookmark number 11 'Disaster of Floods Shin Yoosoung' is activated!]
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Beast King’s Sensitivity Lv.???'  is activated!]
White fur fluttering like white snow.
Yoo Jonghyuk's pupils wavered as he looked this way. Even someone with only instincts would have noticed.
No matter how strong the beast-turned-guy is, he can't defeat me now.
<&>「"I am the 'Beast Lord'."」
Shin Yoosoung, the Disaster of Floods.
<&>「"King of all 'monsters'."」
Kim Dokja rushed over in an instant and hit Yoo Jonghyuk on the head with the side of the blade.
One shot, two shots, three shots.
Even though it seemed like an attack that could be easily avoided, Yoo Jonghyuk could not avoid it. Like a subject who cannot disobey the king's orders.
Every time Yoo Jonghyuk's head was hit, 41st Shin Yoosoung's story was told.
<&>「"What on earth were we to the captain?"」
<&>「"I hate you for living alone in this world."」
<&>「"I will end your world in the most horrific way."」
No matter what anyone says, they cannot say that this pain is a lie.
41st round Shin Yoosoung's very existence was the crime of 41st round Yoo Jonghyuk.
As if receiving punishment for his crime, Kim Dokja delivered a powerful kick to Yoo Jonghyuk's stomach.
Yoo Jonghyuk flew about ten meters and fell, breaking the window of the National Assembly building.
<&>「"Ahjussi… Can I call you that too?"」
The moment Kim Dokja heard that voice again, he stopped.
Whose memory is this?
Shin Yoosoung, or Shin Yoosoung in the 41st round?
Or not,
'Are you okay?'
Is this a memory of Kim Dokja, who was the 'Demon King of Salvation'?
—What if I’m not okay?
For the first time, I felt a certain emotion in Kim Dokja's voice.
He spoke like a person who does not want to let go of those emotions.
'Isn't it okay to say that I miss her when I miss her?'
Why is he so cold? Was the Kim Dokja I knew really that kind of person?
No.
At least the 'Demon King of Salvation' I know is...
—Because that’s not my 'role'.
Role?
—It’s up to the other 'Kim Dokja' to feel sad when he sees people.
The moment I heard those words, all my questions suddenly seemed to make sense.
When he first saw Jung Heewon, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Jihye, and Shin Yoosoung.
The reason why the words Kim Dokja used to call them felt somehow distant and unfamiliar, could not be—
'Why is that?'
Any Kim Dokja has the right to be sad. It's nice to see someone you like and you can call them in a friendly way.
You can talk about your feelings.
But he didn't do that.
—Because I am the 'first Kim, Dokja Kim'.
Kim Dokja was looking at Yoo Joonghyuk.
Yoo Joonghyuk, the beast that rose up from inside the Capitol, ran screaming.
He said, "Kim Dokja likes 'Ways of Survival'."
If seen from afar, it would have looked like black and white monsters swinging their claws at each other.
<&>「Kim Dokja is more cold-hearted than anyone else.」
At the moment when Yoo Joonghyuk's claws caught on the tip of the fur of the 'Beast King's sensitivity', 'Unbreakable Faith' radiated light.
<&>「Kim Dokja, who hates losses and hates constellations.」
Yoo Jonghyuk stumbled after being hit.
Kim Dokja pushed forward without giving him any time to rest.
<&>「In order for all other 'Kim Dokjas' to exist, Kim Dokja had to survive before anyone else.」
Yoo Jonghyuk, who was on the defensive, activated his skill.
<!>[Pacheonyuseonggyeol.]
The strongest skill that Yoo Jonghyuk can use now was revealed.
A bundle of force that tears the world apart poured towards me.
<&>「Kim’Dokja chose to become the Demon King to save someone.」
Kim Dokja was not embarrassed and slowly opened his arms. As if embracing a shattered world.
<!>['Monster Gate' is activated.]
Dozens of portals swirled in the air, and disaster-level monster species popped out at the same time.
The various breaths that poured out from the mouth of the monster species offset the bundle of strong energy of the broken meteor shower.
<&>「He is the 'Demon King of Salvation'.」
As he slowly approached, a feeling of fear appeared in the black beast's pupils.
Kim Dokja smiled faintly, as if to appease Yoo Jonghyuk.
"I’ll just take what’s mine back."
The 'Kim Dokja fragment' that was stuck in Yoo Jonghyuk’s back was pulled out along with blood.
And at that very moment, the forgotten memories of the 'Demon King of Salvation' returned.
