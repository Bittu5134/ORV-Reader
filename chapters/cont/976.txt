<title>976 Episode 58 Myth-grade Constellation (8)
The 'Ten Fingers of God' wielded by the Sun Hunter were sacred relics representing the absolute will of Emperor Di Ku, the third of the Five Emperors.
<&>「The direction his arrowhead points is the decree of the Emperor himself.」
The <Emperor's> 'Giant Story' coiled around the relic like a living serpent, causing every star in the vicinity to let out a collective, trembling sigh.
<@>[Oh, ohhh—]
<@>[The White Arrow of the Emperor!]
The constellations, recognizing the artifact, couldn't suppress their fervor. It was only natural; according to Bicheonhori's '100 Strongest', that arrow was the very relic that had elevated Fei Hu into an incarnation comparable to Yoo Joonghyuk.
<&>「In several worldlines of 'Ways of Survival', Fei Hu, the exclusive incarnation of <Emperor>, inherits that arrow.」
The fact that Hou Yi still wielded it meant that Fei Hu had yet to succeed the Sun Hunter’s lineage in this particular round. Asmodeus, staring at the white-glowing arrowhead, narrowed his eyes and hissed.
<#>【Emperor... are you truly prepared to confront me now?】
Hou Yi’s brow furrowed. He, too, seemed to have finally pierced through the disguise to sense the Recorder’s true identity.
<@>[I am, Great Recorder.]
<#>【I did not ask a mere Narrative-grade. Is this an action sanctioned by the Myth-grade entities of your nebula?】
<@>[I am indeed just a Narrative-grade constellation, however...]
Hou Yi didn't hesitate. He pivoted the arrowhead toward the Black Flame Dragon.
<@>[This arrow is anything but 'mere'.]
I studied the relic in his grasp. Each of the 'Ten Fingers of God' possessed a distinct, specialized power. And the one he held now—
<&>「The second finger of Di Ku.」
I felt as if an entire epoch of history were being compressed into a single point. A cold sweat traced a path down my spine. Just looking at that arrow made me feel as if I were standing face-to-face with 'the one who gave birth to the King of Kings'.
<&>「Di Ku was watching.」
The monarch who had crushed countless stars across endless battlefields, the sovereign who had woven an impenetrable narrative through eternal war—he was pointing his index finger directly at us.
<&>「The index finger of the God who issues the command.」
The heavens began to press down. Every star belonging to <Emperor> across the universe focused its gaze on this spot. The flickering, howling, and screaming of the stars echoed the arrow's intent.
<&>「His finger, pointing toward the end of the world, transcends all probability to gather the eyes of the cosmos.」
A single thread of narrative, spun from the collective starlight of every constellation in the sector, was threaded into Hou Yi's bow. The moment he released it, I was struck by the hallucination of a falling star crashing toward me.
<#>【You are truly serious, then.】
Asmodeus gritted his teeth. The sentences radiating from his form began to forcibly reconstruct the Black Flame Dragon’s story.
<&>「In the forgotten abyss of the ancient dragon, an ominous egg hatched.」
<&>「That dragon shall grow into a merciless disaster, devouring both light and shadow, until its infinite greed consumes every spark of starlight in existence.」
Seeing those emblems, I recalled the <Black Cloud Foundation> from the New Murim District—a corporation designed to farm D-Coins and train ascendants.
<&>「But the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon I knew would never run such a tedious organization.」
The Black Flame Dragon reigned as the head of <Black Cloud>, but he never 'ruled'. He was like Yoo Joonghyuk—a sovereign who existed as a symbol rather than an administrator. The fact that he had established a foundation in the lower scenarios was a glaring anomaly.
<&>「What if this entire architecture was Asmodeus’s design?」
A pillar of pitch-black flame erupted from the dragon’s maw. It resembled [Black Flame], but it was far more solitary, far darker—a flame of absolute contradiction, closer to void than light.
<&>「Breath of the Abyss.」
The flame, seemingly devouring all ambient light, collided with the Emperor’s White Arrow.
<!>[Every constellation in the vicinity is captivated!]
<!>[Some constellations have been blinded by witnessing the clash of myths!]
A heart-pounding pressure enveloped the battlefield. Witnessing it felt as though the very essence of the universe was being wrung out. Through the deafening roar, I watched the lights of the blinded stars extinguish. I desperately expanded my status to shield my incarnation body.
<!>[You have witnessed a Great Battle!]
<!>[The seeds of a new story have begun to sprout!]
A surge of adrenaline raced through me. This was the raw elation of witnessing a high-level battlefield firsthand.
<!>[The constellations of <Emperor> stand as a vanguard behind the Sun Hunter!]
But the clash wasn't over. Framed by a backdrop of brilliant constellations, Hou Yi stood in the sky, his face pale but determined.
<@>[What a magnificent beast you've created.]
A vortex of black dust swirled. At the heart of the light and shadow, the dragon—now twice its original size—gleamed with crimson eyes.
Ohhhhhhh—!
Even with my Myth-grade status, that roar nearly shattered my focus. The dragon, bolstered by Asmodeus's records, possessed terrifying power. Despite a massive wound on one wing, it had neutralized the 'Finger of God' with minimal damage. Hou Yi muttered under his breath.
<@>[Are you drawing upon the Nebula's probability in addition to your own?]
I saw it too—the Grand Narrative of the nebula embedded in the dragon's scales.
<!>[The probability of the Nebula, 'Black Cloud', resides within the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon!]
In this version of the story, the souls of every evil dragon who had perished in history now resided within him. This narrative had been fueled by the massive amount of D-Coins harvested from the lower scenarios.
<!>[A colossal amount of 'D-Coins' has been expended!]
<!>[The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon's activity has been temporarily restricted!]
<#>【My turn now.】
Asmodeus smiled with triumph. Hou Yi's complexion turned ashen.
<&>「The Ten Fingers of God require a recovery period after the first strike.」
Until the reload was complete, Hou Yi had to face a Mythical entity with only his own strength.
<#>【Stars of the Emperor, did you think you could rewrite my record with a few fingers?】
Perhaps if he had fired multiple arrows at once, the outcome would be different. But with the first shot blocked, Asmodeus had seized the momentum. Or so he thought.
"Actually, I think he already changed it."
Asmodeus blinked, looking around in confusion. A sentence manifested in the air.
<&>「The Black Flame Dragon's tail, pierced by the arrow’s light, began to bleed.」
Only then did Asmodeus realize.
<#>【No way.】
From the start, Hou Yi’s goal hadn't been to kill the dragon, but to rescue me. I had seized the moment of impact to slip through the dragon’s grip. From across the battlefield, Hou Yi sent me a [Direct Transmission].
—Run, Demon King of Salvation.
It was an unexpected gesture from a constellation of <Emperor>.
—The Emperor desires you. You must not die here.
Whether it was loyalty to his nebula or his own inherent code, I couldn't say. But I had a debt to repay.
—If I leave, you and your followers will be slaughtered.
—It does not matter.
Hou Yi looked ready to embrace death. Retreating with Jung Heewon and Anna Croft when the 'Exposed Bush' expired was the logical move. But I couldn't do it.
<&>「I can never ignore a character with an expression like that.」
I sent a message back.
—That’s a pathetic thing to say. Kyrgios or the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint would be ashamed to hear it.
Hou Yi’s eyes snapped to mine.
—How do you know those names? Where are they? Who are you?
—Are you curious?
I gave him a meaningful smile.
<&>「Hou Yi accepted the Emperor's contract solely to find news of his lost comrades.」
I didn't know the location of every Transcendent, but I knew enough about the Sword Saint to make a deal.
—Let’s fight. We’ll forge a legend here by toppling a Myth-grade entity. Do that, and I’ll tell you everything I know about the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.
Hou Yi stared at me, stunned.
—Are you insane? That is a monster empowered by a Great Recorder.
—The record.
I smiled and added:
—I can rewrite that, too.
I turned toward the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon. His eyes, radiating a lethal abyssal aura, were locked onto me. He was undeniably a Myth-grade being, but there was a hollow resonance to his story—as if the source was corrupted. Asmodeus spread his arms, a predatory grin on his face.
<#>【I knew you wouldn't run. Your greed is your greatest flaw. Do you truly intend to challenge me?】
Normally, I wouldn't dream of engaging Asmodeus directly. I glanced at Jung Heewon, still shielded by the 'Exposed Bush', and spoke.
<!>[Yes. Let's finish this, Asmodeus.]
The power of [□□] surged. The world began to lose its color. Despite the lingering backlash, the Recorder’s authority allowed me to override the local probability.
<&>「The forgotten constellation once again reveals its light in the night sky of the <Star Stream>.」
The legends I had built began to manifest upon my body.
<&>「King of a Kingless World.」
<&>「He Who Opposes the Treacherous.」
<&>「He Who Hunted the King of Calamity.」
<&>「He Who Slayed the Deity of Another World.」
<&>「The Demon King of Salvation.」
Using the knowledge gained from Han Sooyoung, I replicated the status of my former self.
<&>「The constellation of the 'Demon King of Salvation' is etched into the abyssal firmament.」
<!>[Your 'Giant Story' responds to your will!]
The original form was Narrative-grade, but now, I was drawing out power that rivaled the pinnacle of that status. If I synchronized my other abilities—
<!>[The constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', descends upon the battlefield!]
The battlefield fell silent. A voice whispered from the shadows of a nearby constellation.
<@>[Is he... is he also a Myth-grade?]
In terms of pure weight, I was no longer inferior to the entities before me. However, Asmodeus’s expression shifted into something unsettling.
<#>【You...】
It wasn't just shock; it was something closer to pity.
<#>【Have you been recording 'yourself' this entire time?】
"What if I have?"
<#>【Do you not know why Recorders never record themselves?】
I paused. I didn't need [Lie Detection] to feel the weight of his words.
<#>【Recorders must never [record] their own existence. No one who values their soul would dare. If you continue to use that power, you will eventually lose the very thing you are trying to save. You have broken the ultimate taboo...】
For the first time, Asmodeus was speaking a fundamental truth.
<#>【In the end, you will be erased from the 'Final Records'.】
