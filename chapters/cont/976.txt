<title>976 Episode 58 Mythical Constellation (8)
The 'Ten Fingers of God' of the Sun Hunter were a sacred relic representing the will of Emperor Gu, the fifth emperor of the <Emperor>.
<&>「The direction his arrowhead points is the Emperor's will.」
The <Emperor's> 'Giant Story' entwined within the sacred relic swirled, causing the stars in the area to collectively sigh.
<!>[Oh, ohhh—]
<!>[The <Emperor's> White Arrow!]
The constellations, recognizing the arrow, couldn't hide their excitement. It was understandable.
According to Bicheonhori's '100 Strongest', that arrow was the sacred relic that transformed Feihu into an incarnation comparable to Yoo Joonghyuk.
<&>「In some rounds of 'Ways of Survival', Fei Hu, the exclusive incarnation of the <Emperor>, obtains that arrow.」
The fact that the Sun Hunter possesses that arrow likely means that Fei Hu has yet to succeed the Sun Hunter lineage in this round.
Asmodeus, upon seeing the white-glowing arrowhead, frowned and shouted.
<#>【Emperor, are you saying you will confront me now?】
The Sun Hunter's eyebrows furrowed at Asmodeus's incantation. The Sun Hunter, too, seemed to have sensed Asmodeus's true identity.
<!>[Yes, great recorder.]
<#>【I didn't ask a mere narrative-grade constellation. Is this something the <Emperor>'s myth-grade constellations agree on?】
<!>[I'm just a narrative-grade constellation, though.]
The Sun Hunter, without any hesitation, swung the arrowhead at the Black Flame Dragon.
<!>[This arrow isn't like that.]
I checked the arrow the Sun Hunter held.
The 'Ten Fingers of the Gods', a sacred relic of Emperor Wu, imbued each arrow with a different power.
Now, that 'arrow'—
<&>「The second finger of Emperor Wu.」
I felt as if an entire era of stories were being compressed into a single point, and a cold sweat formed on my spine. Just staring at that arrow made me feel as if I were face-to-face with Emperor Wu, 'the one who gave birth to the King of Kings'.
<&>「Emperor Wu was looking this way.」
'The one who gave birth to the King of Kings'— Emperor Wu.
A constellation that defeated countless stars in countless battlefields. A monarch who built an impenetrable story in endless war. A being who ruled the great universe from the highest seat of the <Emperor>. He pointed his index finger in this direction.
<&>「The index finger of the God who confirms orders.」
The heavens began to look down on us. Every star of the <Emperor> in the entire universe looked down on us. The flickering of stars, howling, sighing, and screaming, echoed the arrow's meaning.
<&>「His finger, pointing to the end of the world, transcends probability and gathers the gaze of the stars.」
A single line of stories, woven from the light of all the stars residing in the area, was woven into the Sun Hunter's bow.
The moment the Sun Hunter released his bow, I was gripped by the illusion of a gigantic star flying towards me.
<#>【You're serious, you.】
Asmodeus, upon confirming the arrow, declared with a stern grin. The sentences flowing from his entire body were reconstructing the Black Flame Dragon's stories.
<&>「In the forgotten abyss of the ancient dragon, an ominous black dragon's egg hatched.」
<&>「That egg will grow into a merciless disaster, devouring both light and darkness, and with its infinite greed, it will devour all the starlight in the world.」
As I gazed at Asmodeus's emblems, I suddenly remembered a company called the <Black Cloud Foundation> in the 'New Murim District'. It was a company that collected D-Coins and trained ascendants.
<&>「But the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' I know would never run such a troublesome company.」
The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon is the leader of the <Black Cloud> nebula, but he doesn't directly run it. It's like the Supreme King Yoo Joonghyuk reigning but not ruling.
Yet, the Black Flame Dragon, who was like that, decided to establish the <Black Cloud Foundation> in a lower scenario area.
<&>「What if all of this was Asmodeus's scheme?」
A pitch-black flame erupted from the Black Flame Dragon's mouth. At first glance, it resembled [Black Flame], but it was a far more solitary and dark flame. A flame of contradiction, closer to darkness than light.
<&>「Breath of the Abyss.」
A pitch-black flame, seemingly absorbing all light, shot from the Black Flame Dragon's mouth. The flame spun and collided with the Emperor's white arrow.
<!>[All the constellations in the area are captivated!]
<!>[Some constellations are going blind for having witnessed the great battle!]
A heart-pounding excitement enveloped the battlefield. Just watching felt like the sap of the universe was being squeezed out of them. Amidst the deafening roar, I saw the lights of the blinded stars go out.
I desperately opened my latitudes to protect my incarnation body.
<!>[You have witnessed a great battle!]
<!>[The possibility of a new story has sprouted!]
A feeling of ecstasy welled up in my chest as the message rang in my ears. The elation of witnessing the fierce battle of a great battlefield firsthand.
<!>[The constellations of the Nebula, <Emperor>, guard the rear of the 'Sun Hunter'.]
But the battle was far from over. With dazzling constellations at his back, the Sun Hunter, occupying a corner of the sky, spoke with a slightly pale face.
<@>[What a magnificent evil dragon.]
With that, a swirl of pitch-black dust rose into the sky. At the center of the fierce clash of light and darkness, a black dragon, twice as large as before, gleamed with glowing red eyes.
Ohhhhhhh—!
Even though I had reached the rank of mythic being, I felt like I was losing my mind just hearing that roar.
The Black Flame Dragon, carrying Asmodeus's record, possessed power beyond imagination. Although it suffered a large wound on one wing, the Black Flame Dragon had managed to block one of the great 'Ten Fingers of God', one that even brought down the sun, with minimal damage.
The Sun Hunter muttered in a somber voice.
<!>[Are you using the power of the Nebula in addition to the Recorder's authority?]
I, too, have confirmed the grand narrative of the Nebula embedded within the Black Flame Dragon's entire body.
<!>[The probability of the Nebula, 'Black Cloud', resides within the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon'.]
In countless narratives, the souls of evil dragons who perished in disasters now reside with the Black Dragon. And what made this narrative possible was the 'D-Coins' collected from the Ascension Hall in the lower scenario.
<!>[Someone has spent a massive amount of 'D-Coins'!]
<!>[The probability of the constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon','s activity has been temporarily reduced!]
<#>【It's my turn now.】
Asmodeus smiled triumphantly. Meanwhile, the Sun Hunter's complexion paled slightly.
<&>「The Ten Fingers of God require a brief cooldown after firing the first shot.」
Until the reload time was up, the Sun Hunter had to deal with the mythical constellation with only his own strength.
<#>【Stars of the Emperor, did you think you could change my record with just a few fingers?】
If he had fired several 'White Arrows' from the start, it might have been different. But with the first arrow blocked, it seemed Asmodeus had already taken control.
To be precise—
<!>[Well, I think he changed it?]
That would have been the case if he hadn't.
Startled, Asmodeus glanced around belatedly.
Then, a sentence floated into the air.
<&>「The Black Flame Dragon's tail, pierced by the arrow's tip, was shedding tears.」
Only then did Asmodeus seem to realize what had happened.
<#>【No way.】
From the very beginning, the Sun Hunter's goal was to see through the mythical story and rescue me. And I managed to capture the moment of impact, successfully escaping the Black Flame Dragon's tail.
From afar, the Sun Hunter exchanged glances with me and sent a telegram.
—Run away, Demon King of Salvation.
At first glance, it seemed a somewhat incomprehensible action. He, the constellation of <Emperor>, would even offer his help.
—The Emperor wants you, so you must not die here.
Whether it was loyalty to the <Emperor> or the dignity inherent in his character, I couldn't tell.
However, I received a favor, and I had a duty to repay it.
—If I withdraw from this, you and your companions will all die.
—It doesn't matter.
The Sun Hunter already looked prepared for death. Perhaps withdrawing from here would be the solution. I knew that the safest option was to take Jung Heewon and Anna Croft and retreat from the battlefield when the 'Exposed Bush' was lifted.
But why?
<&>「I can't ignore a character with that kind of expression.」
I told the Sun Hunter.
—That's a weak statement, uncharacteristic of you. Master Kyrgios or the Breaking the Sky Sword Master would have been disappointed if they heard it.
The Sun Hunter's expression changed abruptly at my words.
—How do you know about my friends? Where are they? Who are you?
—Are you curious about their news?
I smiled meaningfully at the Sun Hunter and asked,
<&>「The Sun Hunter accepted the <Emperor>'s command in exchange for hearing news of the Transcendents.」
I don't know the fate of all the Transcendents. However, if it were Breaking the Sky Sword Master, I could share a little with him.
—Let's fight together. We'll fight here and gain the legend of defeating a mythical constellation. Then I'll tell you the news about the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.
The Sun Hunter glared at me, dumbfounded by my words, and asked.
—Are you serious? A monster that received the finger of God. Furthermore, that being also possesses a great recorder.
—The record.
I smiled at the Sun Hunter and added,
—I can do it too.
I slowly turned my head toward the Black Flame Dragon.
<&>「The Black Flame Dragon's eyes, radiating a threatening abyssal aura, were staring at me.」
That 'Black Flame Dragon' was undoubtedly a mythical constellation. However, something about it felt incomplete. While it undoubtedly possessed a powerful and distant story, it felt as if some source was distorted.
Asmodeus, our gazes meeting, spread his arms and smiled as if he had been waiting.
<#>【I knew it would be so. I knew you wouldn't run away, given your greed. Do you intend to fight me?】
Normally, I wouldn't have dared to engage Asmodeus here, recklessly.
I glanced at Jung Heewon, still hiding among the 'Exposed Bush', and opened my mouth.
<!>[Yes. Let's fight, Asmodeus.]
The power of skill [□□] activated, and the scenery began to turn colorless. Although the shock of the rebound hadn't completely dissipated, using the Recorder's power allowed me to defy the odds to some extent.
<&>「The forgotten constellation has once again revealed itself in the night sky of <Star Stream>.」
The legends of a constellation began to be etched onto my body.
<&>「King of a Kingless World.」
<&>「He Who Opposes the Treacherous.」
<&>「He Who Hunted the King of Calamity.」
<&>「He Who Slayed the Deity of Another World.」
<&>「Demon King of Salvation.」
A trick to replicate the power of the 'Demon King of Salvation' in my body. The constellation of the 'Demon King of Salvation', which I trained with Han Sooyoung, fully unleashed its power.
<&>「The constellation of the 'Demon King of Salvation' was engraved into the abyssal sky.」
Upon that constellation, the stories I had personally built were added.
<@>[Your 'Giant Story' responds to your will!]
The original 'Demon King of Salvation' mode's power was at the level of a late-stage narrative-grade constellation. However, now, I could unleash power approaching the final stage.
And if I combined my other abilities—
<!>[The constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', descends upon the battlefield.]
For a moment, everyone on the battlefield fell silent, overwhelmed by my power. A soft murmur was heard from one of the hidden constellations.
<@>[Could it be that this person is also a 'myth-grade'?]
That's right. I don't know about my current fighting prowess, but at least in my weight class, I'm not inferior to a myth.
However, Asmodeus's expression changed strangely upon seeing me.
<#>【You…】
Like the other constellations, he was astonished, but the reason behind his astonishment was a little different.
<#>【Have you been recording 'yourself' all this time?】
<@>[But?]
Since becoming the 'Recorder of Fear', I've been recording myself whenever necessary. No, perhaps I've been doing so since before I became a Recorder.
<#>【Why did you do that?】
<@>[What?]
<#>【Don't you know why Recorders don't record 'themselves'?】
I paused for a moment at this unexpected statement. I knew it even without using [Lie Detection]. The pity and sigh in Asmodeus's gaze was palpable.
Every ounce of my senses as a Recorder spoke.
<#>【Recorders must not [record] themselves. No recorder would do such a thing. If you continue to use that power, you will ultimately lose yourself. You have broken the taboo of the records—】
Now, Asmodeus is telling the truth.
<#>【Ultimately, you will be excluded from the 'Final Records'.】
