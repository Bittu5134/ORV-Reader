<title>760 Episode 32 Monkey King (7)
Perhaps even Kim Dokja would not have heard the voice of 'Gods of the Other World' as much as I do now.
While the Constellations' voices felt clear and bold, the 'God of the Other World'’s voice was closer to the feeling of hearing a discordant sound.
An infinitely disturbing voice that goes against the system of this world.
But even in this uneasiness, there was a temperature. Some disturbances were hot and damp, while others were cool and harsh.
And the voice I just heard was clearly closer to the latter.
The extreme cold of winter.
A voice coming from the edge of the universe that has reached absolute zero.
Not Asmodeus.
Then who is it?
What's certain is that it's a voice I feel like I've heard before somewhere.
And the person who has this voice is the person who helped me and <Kim Dokja Company> meet.
I wanted to ask.
Even if I am destroyed as you said, I want to know the reason why Kim Dokja did not return.
But my voice still wouldn't come out, and all I could do was blink my eyes as best as I could.
<#>【Then.】
Fortunately, the owner of the voice read the signal.
<#>【Go up to the top floor of the 'Recycling Center'. Because the 'story' you are looking for will be there.】
<!>[Stage 3 of the exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is released.]
***
The two carriages came together on either side with a loud sound.
The sound of carriage wheels scraping.
"Yerin-ssi!"
Cha Yerin pressed the acceleration button, but the opposing carriages were faster.
As the carriages wheeled close together, the three carriages tangled and rattled dangerously.
"Sorry. I’m not good at driving—"
"No. It’s not Yerin-ssi’s fault."
Clearly, Cha Yerin accelerated properly. The problem was over there.
"That carriage, it looks like a carriage with options."
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Edit Lv.10' is activated.]
When Ji Eunyu's exclusive skill [Edit] was activated, the composition of the carriage's story was revealed at a glance.
<!>[Story fragment 'Major Haste' continues its storytelling.]
<!>[Story fragment 'Courner' continues its storytelling.]
Ji Eunyu frowned.
"Why don’t we have something like that?"
No matter how you look at it, it wasn't an option that was attached from the beginning. If that were the case, the same 'story fragments' would have been detected in the carriage she is riding now.
That means they got that piece from somewhere and put it on.
<!>[The Constellation 'Snake Cutting Its Tail' grins.]
It seemed like there was someone in the Chinese zodiac who used a trick.
I guess they found out about the 'Recycling Center'’s scenario in advance and secretly supported their incarnation.
"Meihouwang! Wake up! Let’s make something like that too!"
But Meihouwang did not wake up from his snoring. The same thing happened to the man next to her.
Meanwhile, the pressure from both sides continued.
"Give me Kim Dokja!"
A voice coming from somewhere. At first, she thought I heard it wrong, but when she listened to it again, she was sure there was no mistake.
"Give me Kim Dokja!"
Ji Eunyu laughed.
"It was like that throughout the main story, and it’s still like that here."
"…"
"Huh? Yerin-ssi, were you laughing just now?"
"No."
The two glanced at the sleeping man's face. He said they would come back in 1 minute, but it felt like 10 minutes had already passed.
But neither of them woke him up. Because they believed that if he didn't wake up, there was a good reason.
The number of carriages following outside the window was increasing.
Three, four, five.
Ji Eunyu hesitated, then took out a dagger from her chest and began to sharpen it.
<!>[You begin cleaning the relic 'Ghost'.]
Cha Yerin, who glanced at Ji Eunyu’s appearance, asked.
"Eunyu-ssi."
"Yes."
"Are you close with the Author?"
"Well, we went through some difficult times together."
"Tough times."
"Yes, tough times."
"Was the author like this when you first met him?"
"If he looks like this…"
"Kim Dokja’s face."
"That’s what I remember."
"So the Author was Kim Dokja from the beginning?"
"Yes?"
"The writer—"
A shout was heard from outside looking for Kim Dokja once again.
Cha Yerin continued speaking after a moment.
"When this story ends, will he return to the world he came from?"
The world he came from.
Ji Eunyu thought for a moment and then answered.
"I’m an editor, so I don’t know much about that, but I know one thing for sure. The world the writer will return to is 'reality'."
"…"
"And the author’s reality."
Ji Eunyu, who had finally finished trimming the dagger, stood up from her seat and looked at Cha Yerin.
"It’s a place where there are readers to read."
<!>[The relic 'Ghost' has been cleaned.]
"Yerin-ssi, I will leave the writer to you for a while. I have to go up to the roof."
"I hope you don’t mind."
"Please drive."
Ji Eunyu quickly jumped out the window and stood on the roof of the carriage. Then, as if they had been waiting, there were incarnations that jumped onto the roof opposite. Judging by the stories flowing around them, they were the incarnations of the 'snake force'.
"Give me Kim Dokja!"
"Our author, you are very popular here."
At someone's command, the incarnations of the side carriages rushed over to the roof.
Ji Eunyu immediately threw the dagger.
The incarnations on the side laughed as they saw the dagger flying through the wind. This is because the trajectory and speed of the flying dagger were ordinary.
<!>[The relic 'Ghost' remembers your sincere care.]
<!>[The first 'Ghost' of the relic 'Ghost' is activated.]
<!>[The cutting power and acceleration of the relic 'Ghost Blade' increases tenfold for 10 minutes!]
Ghost is one of the treasures of <The First Murim>. It was a 'hidden piece' obtained from a meteorite with the support of her sponsor.
The downside is that it can only be used after 'ten cleaning sessions' every day.
However, once the preparation was completed, the monster's attack power for 10 minutes was enough to surpass the famous sword 'Black Heavenly Demon Blade'.
"This is crazy—"
The complexions of the incarnations changed as they sensed that the blade's prowess had changed.
Limbs and limbs being cut off like cutting soft tofu.
As two incarnations fell down in an instant following the blade's path, one of the incarnations on the roof of the rear carriage shouted.
"Kill her quickly!"
The ghost was already moving away along its trajectory.
Five incarnations rushed to Ji Eunyu at the same time, whose weapon had disappeared.
However.
"It’s a waste of space."
"What?"
"Ah, you’re perfect for being edited."
A sound was heard from somewhere, and the legs f two more incarnations flew off. It was a neat work of art, as if cutting out unnecessary sentences from a manuscript.
"Kaaaaaaak!"
The ghost, who was thought to have followed the trajectory and gone away, was soon back in Ji Eunyu's hands.
Translucent spider art ran along the tip of the dagger.
Belatedly, the incarnation also realized what was happening.
"No way is that—"
<!>[The exclusive skill 'Arachne’s Web' is in effect.]
The Holy Spirit of <Olympus>, [Arachne’s Web].
Originally, this holy spirit could not be used unless it was a terminal incarnation of <Olympus>, but she was the exception.
This was possible because <Olympus> was destroyed in the world line of her sponsor.
<!>[Some Constellations are surprised to see your skills!]
Incarnations were buzzing from the carriages that followed at the rear.
"Who is that person? Could it be that she is an incarnation of <Olympus>?"
"That can’t be true. The use of stigmata must be restricted."
"If you touch her by mistake—"
"The bounty amount is high. I can’t miss this opportunity."
As she listened to the story, it was clear how the situation was going.
It seems that someone with a vengeance in the middle of the Chinese Zodiac had put up a bounty scenario on this side.
Ji Eunyu smiled and continued.
"If you touch me, the entire <Olympus> will attack. Are you prepared?"
At first glance, she thought it was a good thing because there were so many carriages. If she can take advantage of this misunderstanding, without unnecessary fights—
<!>[Someone is activating 'Lie Detection'.]
<!>[Someone confirmed that the statement is not true.]
Ji Eunyu let out a light sigh.
"As expected. There is no way this novel will proceed easily."
"Hit her! All we have to do is deal with the guy in the carriage!"
Ji Eunyu deflected the incoming weapons with [Arachne's Web].
But no matter how strong she was, it was difficult for her to handle multiple attacks.
"Yerin-ssi! Run!"
Perhaps because of the fundamental difference in the performance of the carriages, no matter how much they drove, their carriages did not get far away.
It was then that one side of the spider web broke.
"Now!"
In the blink of an eye, a round object pierced through the carriage window.
<!>[The Constellation 'Snake Cutting Its Tail' awaits your destruction.]
Ji Eunyu immediately recognized what the item was.
'Mass destruction magical bullet.'
It was the exact item used by Han Sooyoung in the main story.
Ji Eunyu shouted, swearing inwardly.
"Yerin-ssi! Author!"
But the explosion was faster. The carriage flew apart with a loud noise, and Ji Eunyu was swept away by the explosion.
<!>[The 'Orient Express' was destroyed.]
Her consciousness flickered with a despairing message.
The moment her body, soaring high in the sky, fell violently toward the floor, Ji Eunyu felt the wind blowing from somewhere.
Someone was holding her with both hands.
The man's face was reflected in a dazzling halo, and Ji Eunyu’s breath was taken away. Because that face resembled someone she had imagined for a long time.
"Kim Dokja?"
Then the man answered.
"Of course. That’s my name."
Ji Eunyu answered.
"Liar?..."
The man nodded his head.
"It’s my job to lie. You can pass out now."
Ji Eunyu was relieved and closed her eyes.
***
I landed on the floor, carrying the unconscious Ji Eunyu on my back.
I roughly guessed and understood the situation.
Did she use ‘that weapon’?
It's an item that only has settings and has never been used in the main story, but it looks like she managed to get it.
<!>[The target is currently in a 'vulnerable to fainting' state.]
The strangeness also imposes status abnormalities on the user depending on the strangeness that occurs.
It seems that her current status abnormality is 'vulnerable to fainting'.
I looked at Ji Eunyu’s fainted expression for a moment. Although she had Min Jiwoon's face, her visible fatigue was clearly that of Ji Eunyu that I knew.
She was like this when she stayed in the editing room all night editing a book. Maybe she hasn't been able to sleep a wink since she possessed a character.
Even if there is a 'vulnerability to fainting' penalty, she is not the kind of person who will faint like this.
"Author."
Cha Yerin landed with the rising wind. As expected, she who possessed the [Way of the Wind] appears to have been unharmed even in the explosion.
"What happened to them?"
"We took care of a few people, but the rest all ran away."
Since our carriage was broken anyway, I guess they thought their goal was achieved.
It could have been so. In this scenario, without a carriage, you are as good as dead.
"I’m sorry. I—"
"No, you did well."
"Are the other party members okay?"
I hesitated for a moment and then answered.
"They’re safe."
Would Cha Yerin believe me if I told her that I came after watching with <Kim Dokja Company>?
Would Cha Yerin be upset if the meaning of 'party' became unfamiliar to me just because I met them in such a short period of time?
I shook my head lightly and promised.
"We will make them safe."
My group is over here now. And these are the people I must protect.
"What should we do? We lost the carriage—"
"It’s okay. It’s just as it was originally planned."
Kim Dokja in the main story also said, 'I fell from a carriage on the way to the Constellation banquet. This was expected from the beginning.
<!>[You have lost the 'Orient Express'.]
<!>[A new event has occurred!]
For reference, Kim Dokja, who fell from the carriage, was chased by the gods of the nebulae.
<!>[You are no longer protected by the 'Orient Express Wagon'.]
<!>[The gods near the cloud road notice your presence!]
Damn it, it seemed like a similar event was happening here too.
<!>['Edge of the Other World' opens.]
I don't know the origin, but I know it's ominous just by hearing the name.
In the main story, Kim Dokja had 'Dionysus' to protect him. But there is no Dionysus here.
"Let’s run away."
We activated [Way of the Wind] with all our might without even looking back.
<!>[Warning. Your ranking is 'bottom'.]
<!>[You are a representative of 'Zone 13'.]
<!>[If you do not arrive at your destination in time, your entire group will die.]
If I activate [Way of the Wind] with all my might, I can reach the destination faster than a carriage.
The problem is that the distance is too far.
In this state, our magical energy will run out before we reach our destination.
And when our magic power runs out, gods crawling out of the corners of the other world or something will come to kill us.
There was only one choice.
"It’s them, right?"
I rode with [Way of the Wind] and landed on the roof of the carriage that was running ahead.
<!>[Story fragment 'Facial Recognition' recognizes you.]
<!>[You are not the correct passenger in that carriage…]
I tore off the entire roof of the carriage, down to the story fragments. Then the incarnation of the snake force that discovered me widened its eyes in astonishment.
"You—"
<!>[The Constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' reveals his status.]
"Ugh, uhhh—"
The guys just sat down in contemplation just by expressing their anger.
I picked them up one by one and threw them outside, then sat down with Cha Yerin.
<!>[You have captured the 'Orient Express Wagon'.]
<!>[Story fragment 'Facial Recognition' interrupts its storytelling.]
<!>['Orient Express Carriage' recognizes you as a new passenger.]
<!>['Controller' will be provided.]
I grabbed the controller. Even though the roof flew off, it is a model with a story option, so the speed should be quite respectable.
The problem is control.
"I’ll do it. I heard you’re not good at games."
Cha Yerin held out her hand.
"Did Ji Eunyu say something like that? It’s not like I can’t do it—"
To be honest, it's average.
Still, I have to take the wheel this time.
"But this time, I will do it. I am now the 'Demon King of Salvation'."
"Kim Dokja is not good at games either."
Right. Kim Dokja may be worse at games than me.
"But I’m good at imitating guys who are good at games."
<!>[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]
<!>['Bookmark  List' is activated.]
<!>[Currently, due to a temporary error, the 'Bookmark List' cannot be activated.]
Is it because the story of the 'Demon King of Salvation' has not been completely inherited? Unfortunately, the original 'characters' that the Demon King of Salvation knew were not included in the list.
However, this does not mean that there are no 'persons who can be registered'.

Cha Yerin looked in my direction.
I continued to flip through the list of characters.
Surely it exists?
<&>「Did I not understand 'Yoo Joonghyuk of the 41st Round' at all?」
Maybe so. This 'bookmark' will only show characters that I have a little understanding of.
I boasted that I would write this guy's story, but the truth is, I don't really know what kind of person he is.
<!>[This is the last page.]
Finally, the last page of the character list.
As expected, Yoo Joonghyuk of the 41st round was not registered in the bookmarks.
Instead,

There was a strange Yoo Joonghyuk.
