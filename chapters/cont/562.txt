<title>562 Episode 2. Rewrite (7)
While writing Omniscient Reader, there were a few times when the plot would break down.
A character would suddenly speak in a historical drama style, or they would forget a skill (or
more accurately, I would forget it).
I apologized to my readers and made changes to save the day.
But what I did this time was impossible to fix.
"Let's praise the germs who made a significant sacrifice for us."
It's not enough that I've had a profound impact on the cult's religious views, but I'm also involved
in the re-emergence of the Ten Evils.
"Oh— germs, germs, bacterias."
What the hell have you done, Lee Hakhyun?
The reader ahjussi next to me was clapping his hands with the wrong beat, unaware of what was
going on.
<!>[Your influence in this scenario area is significant.]
<!>[The 'view of life' you spread dominates the religious views in the area.]
I wondered if I'd rather be on the wrong side of the tracks and be a villain.
It was not a wise idea.
"Oh— the great sacrifice of the germs."
If I ran into Yoo Joonghyuk while doing something like this, I would be decapitated with a single
blow.
<!>[The character 'Lee Hyunjoo' believes in you.]
<!>[The character 'Im Baekhoon' believes in you.]
<!>[The character 'Yeom Youngcheol' believes in you.]
Still, I didn't feel too bad that everyone believed in me.
I've never had so many people believe in me in my life.
<!>[Most of the incarnations in the area are moved by your words.]
After one hymn, the tension eased, and people sat around the campfire in a circle.

A few people sipped canned drinks from the vending machine, talked, and prayed.
"Isn't this supposed to kill germs? Lactobacillus acidophilus is also a bacterium. I hear no one
makes it to the intestines alive."
"Where were you going, ahjumma?"
"I was just on my way to pick up my son's yogurt. What about you?"
"I had dinner plans with my girlfriend."
"Well, that's funny, because I was just on my way to go to see the chicken restaurant I opened
with my wife, and then this tragedy......."
Others handed me a canned drink and said.
"Bacteria are also living things, this is the first time I've realized it. Wow, young people are so
smart."
"You should study well. Where did you go to college?"
I didn't answer, just smiled meaninglessly.
With a speech by Life Leader Kim Cheolyang, both religious and non-religious people had a
strange look on their faces.
They say that religion is a drug to overcome death, and maybe that's true.
However, not everyone was high on it.
"Are you all crazy? There's a surefire way to live, but you're going to let it go?"
Not surprisingly, it was the big guy. He had something like a pipe in his hand; I didn't know
where he got it from.
I couldn't see him for a moment, then I realized he'd been searching through the station for it.
"If you want to get fucked, get fucked alone."
The people's faces tensed as the weaponized big guy approached.
"Wait a minute, what's wrong with you? You burned your socks earlier."
"Naive assholes. You really believe it's killing if you kill something you can't even see or tell if
it's dead or not?"
"Well, so what?"
"Have you forgotten what that monster showed us earlier? The surest way to get out of here
alive."
The big pipe pointed at the people.
"Kill someone here, and you'll be sure to live."
<!>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' is chuckling.]
I think I know what's going on.

Apparently, one of the constellations encouraged him.
I looked at the big guy and activated [Character List.]

+
The boss of the 'Cheoldoo Group', Lee Cheoldoo.
It wasn't until I read the description that I realized who this guy was.
Come to think of it, there was a group called 'Cheoldoo' at Geumho Station.
The Cheoldoo Group's boss wasn't in the original story of 'Omniscient Reader', but I had created
a setting for it.
I took a step forward and said.
"Don't panic. We're in a group, and he's alone."
No matter how many weapons Lee Cheoldoo had, or whether he was the Cheoldoo Group's boss,
he couldn't fight against twenty-one people.
But Lee Cheoldoo didn't let up.
"Whoa, wait a minute. Kill you all? I only have to kill one of you. From these 27..."
As he scanned the faces of the people, one by one, as if he was picking out the weakest bug, he
glanced in my direction.
"Let's be honest with each other, you're all scared to death of believing that bastard too, aren't
you?"
Lee Cheoldoo laughed lightly and slapped his pipe with his palm as if he understood.
"First ten people. Stick to my side, and I'll take responsibility and save you no matter what."
He took another step forward, adding.

"The rest of you, be prepared to die."
Everyone took a step back as Lee Cheoldoo approached.
Kim Cheolyang panicked and shouted.
"Don't listen to him, everyone. We've already won the right to survive! There's no need to fight
unnecessarily!"
Then, the enraged people shouted in unison.
"That's right, you killed the germs too! You can live if you stay still, why are you doing this?"
"Maybe you don't get it yet, but it's okay now? You can live because you killed the germs."
Still, killing bugs and germs together created a sense of camaraderie, and the unity of the people
wasn't bad.
<!>[The incarnations in the area are united.]
<!>[The influence of the religious view is growing stronger.]
Lee Cheoldoo scratched his ears in disbelief and became irritated.
"You're really crazy. Then let's just have one of you die to me."
"D-don't panic, if we all fight togetherᅳ"
"I don't care how many of you there are."
Lee Cheoldoo's pipe hissed and scraped the floor.
"You'll die in the order you come."
The people backed away in horror.
If everyone pitched in, they might be able to subdue him.
However, no one was willing to step forward.
As he searched for a target, Lee Cheoldoo's eyes landed on the man closest to him.
Realizing that he had been targeted, he called out to the surrounding area.
"H-help me, please! Help me!"
But no one tried to help him. The crowd quickly backed away like a swarm of bugs that had been
discovered.
Lee Cheoldoo raised his pipe as if he knew that would happen.
<!>[The character 'Kim Haemoon' is panicking!]
"S-save me! I'll stick with you!"

Character Kim Haemoon. He had been passive ever since he killed the bug.
Lee Cheoldoo said fiercely.
"No, I don't need you anymore."
"Please, please! I'll give you 100 million if we get out of here, I can even send you the money
right now!"
Lee Cheoldoo frowned as he thought for a moment.
"100 million. Then you decide who to kill."
Kim Haemoon looked at the others with trembling eyes.
The first person he looked at was the ahjumma who said she was going to give her son yogurt.
She was the first to run away when Lee Cheoldoo turned toward Kim Haemoon.
<!>[The character 'Lee Hyekyung' is terrified.]
"W-why are you looking at me! I have to live, my child is waiting for me!"
Kim Haemoon's head turned to look at the man next to her. It was the young man who had dinner
plans with his girlfriend.
<!>[The character 'Jeong Hancheol' is looking around.]
Jeong Hancheol quickly looked back and forth between Kim Haemoon and Lee Cheoldoo, and
gave a small, friendly smile.
"Can I be on your side?"
Kim Haemoon's head snapped back to the middle-aged man beside him.
<!>[The character 'Ji Hyungdong' is freaking out.]
This time, it was the man who said he opened a chicken restaurant with his wife.
I walked over to him, thinking it was a bad idea. The time limit was about to expire, so I had to
drag it out somehow.
But when he saw me, Ji Hyungdong pointed at me.
"I-If you're going to kill someone, kill him! He made this whole thing happen!"
At first, I thought I had misheard him, but then people started chattering around me.
"That's right. He made the situation like situation, he should be held accountable."
They were obviously friendly people until a while ago.

"W-why are you looking at us like that? He's not wrong."
"What's wrong with you, young man? Fight. Fight and win."
"At times like these, you step up like a man!"
My breathing became stifled, as if I were the bug trapped in my pocket.
Lee Cheoldoo smiled at me.
"Okay, you'll work."
In an instant, the surroundings became silent.
When I turned around, people began to avoid my eyes as if they had made a promise.
Even without [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint], it was obvious what they were thinking.
<&>「As long as it's not me.」
I wasn't surprised.
I already knew this was their nature.
I looked at the approaching Lee Cheoldoo and thought to myself.
Avarage physique, strength and agility of 7.
I wonder if I can beat him.
<!>[There are 5 minutes remaining.]
Let's just hold on for five minutes.
I looked at Kim Cheolyang for the last time. He looked at my pupils and made a complicated
expression.
<!>[The character 'Kim Cheolyang' is very troubled.]
<!>[The character 'Kim Cheolyang' is a person whose 'sentence' you wrote yourself.]
<!>[You have a very good understanding of the character.]
I didn't have [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint], but Kim Cheolyang's internal thoughts echoed in
my ears.
<&>「There are three people who have influence in this station right now.」
<&>「Me, the narrow eyes man, and the big guy.」
Kim Cheolyang's eyes quickly switched between me and the big guy.
<&>「If I don't stop him, he'll die.」
<&>「I don't think he's going to listen to me.」
<&>「If I don't succeed, I'll.......」
Quickly changing his posture, Kim Cheolyang took a step away from me with the people and
shouted loudly.

"Don't move rashly, everyone, stand back. God's emissary is about to get redemption(代贖) for
us."
Kim Cheolyang is a man who fears his power being threatened. If he can't stop the beast anyway,
he'd rather take advantage of the situation.
A way to strengthen his position and justify my death.
"No matter how insignificant, a life is a life. Right now, God's emissary is going to sacrifice
himself to atone for killing the bacterial brothers. Let's all say thank you."
It was ridiculous, but the people's eyes were already filled with madness.
They, too, had agreed to sacrifice me for their own survival.
Jeong Hancheol and Ji Hyungdong whispered as they retreated.
"Germs are living beings, you could have just looked it up on the Internet. It's not like it's a big
deal. You'd have figured it out eventually, right?"
"Let's not get into this, let's stay neutral. There's a reason he's so upset."
I was still calm.
<&>「No writer is ever surprised by their own words.」
Lee Cheoldoo's shadow was cast on the spot where the others had retreated. The feet that had
been relentlessly trampling on the bug turned toward me.
"If it's decided, the rest of you get lost. I'm only going to kill this asshole, as promised. Hey, get
out of my way."
People at a short distance were beaten on the arms and legs with the pipe.
"Aaaak! My arm!"
"Don't be stupid, come over here quickly! Only one person needs to die!"
The terrified people quickly ran to the scenario barrier.
Just like that, everyone was far away from my side.
<!>[There are 3 minutes remaining.]
Only one person, the one person who hadn't run away, was still with me for this ending.
