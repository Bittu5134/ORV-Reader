<title>979 Episode 58 Myth-grade Constellation (11)
The Mythical Circle.
When I first reached the status of 'Mythical', I briefly glimpsed its impossible landscape. But back then, I didn't truly feel like a part of that world. I was a mere visitor—an observer who could witness its scenery but lacked the authority to interfere with its events.
<@>[This is likely the greatest gift I can offer you now.]
A die of iridescent hues ascended from Mitra's right hand, radiating a brilliance that pierced through the gloom.
<!>[The constellation, 'Lord of December 25th', has transferred his 'Dice of Destiny' to you!]
The die traced a line of light through the air and settled firmly into my palm. The sensation was unsettlingly familiar, as if it had belonged to me from the very beginning. I knew exactly what it represented.
<&>「Mitra has transferred his seat at the 'Round Table of Myths' to me.」
This 'die' was my invitation—my ticket into the Round Table of Mythology.
<@>[When a star reaches the level of myth, they possess a crystal of their own story, condensed to its absolute limit.]
I belatedly realized the true identity of the die spinning in my hand. It was a fragment of a legend, forged at the very moment Mitra first ascended to the status of a Myth.
<@>[You did not attain Mythology through the path of a 'constellation', so you never received your own. Therefore, take mine.]
A low rumble of thunder rolled through the artificial sky as Mitra made his declaration.
<!>[Some constellations are moved by the decision of the 'Lord of December 25th'!]
<@>[The constellations of the nebula, <Veda>, strongly contest the judgment of the 'Lord of December 25th'!]
Mitra looked up at the firmament. Immediately, the heavens fell into a terrified silence.
<!>[The constellation, 'Lord of December 25th', reveals his true nature!]
<@>[The constellations of <Veda> obey the will of the 'Lord of December 25th'.]
He was a being capable of enforcing his own will, even in defiance of a Great Nebula.
What I had now received was the concentrated essence of such a mythical entity, carved from the core of his own story.
<!>[The sacred relic, 'Dice of Destiny', has been acquired.]
Mitra, having surrendered the die, wore a complex expression of deep regret and profound relief. I realized that now was the time to seek an honest answer from him.
"Mitra, what exactly is the 'Round Table'? And what purpose do these dice serve?"
Even in 'Ways of Survival', the 'Round Table' was never specifically described. It was only mentioned as a secret banquet hall where the 'mythical constellations' gathered. Since even the original Kim Dokja had never been invited, I was woefully lacking in information.
<@>[The Round Table is the place where the fate of the world is decided. And only those who hold the dice have the right to interfere with that fate.]
Mitra gazed silently at the sky, as if reading the constellations written across the void, and added:
<@>[Only the chosen mythical constellations may enter the Round Table banquet. There, they manipulate the ultimate probability of the <Star Stream>.]
"Is it really alright for you to give me something so significant?"
<@>[It doesn't matter. I have no desire to return to that table. Even if I did, there would be little left for me to do. But for you... it may be different.]
Mitra smiled weakly and began to help his fallen subordinates to their feet. One by one, the constellations of the Golden Dice Hall regained their strength, bolstered by Mitra’s grace.
<@>[If you truly seek the ■■ of all these stories, you will eventually have to pass through that hall.]
He spoke with a weariness so heavy that the entire scene felt like a retirement ceremony.
"Are you no longer curious about your own ■■?"
<@>[Is there any constellation that does not wonder about the end?]
"Then why give me the dice?"
Every star exists only to reach the final conclusion of all stories. Born for that purpose, they cannot help but exist for it.
Yet Mitra had just laid down the only tool that would allow him to participate in that final gamble.
<@>[When I first chose to remain in 'Valhalla Hall', many thoughts crossed my mind.]
The harsh radiance emanating from his form had dimmed. He was no longer using coercion; he was simply speaking the truth.
<@>[A desire to avenge my defeat. A desire to punish the 'Round Table' for discarding me. I wanted to shake the Star Stream once more by becoming the center of a new legend.]
"And now?"
Through the die, I could vaguely sense the weight of Mitra's history.
Mitra, who had lost his duel with 'Snowfield Kim Dokja' and was relegated to the master of 'Valhalla Hall'. I saw the history of a god who managed the lesser stars and witnessed countless desperate competitions.
After a brief pause, Mitra continued.
<@>[Once you ascend to the level of myth, you stop looking back at trivial stories. Unless it is a Giant Story, you rarely pay attention. You spend all day consumed by a stagnant laziness, reliving your own glory over and over again.]
To complete a world is to close the door to it and become a prisoner. To complete a myth is to imprison oneself within that legend.
In that sense, all the 'myth-grade constellations' at the pinnacle of this world were captives of their own stories.
<@>[While staying in this hall, I was finally forced to look back at the stories of others.]
Amidst that stagnation, an unexpected opportunity had presented itself to him.
<@>[I was imprisoned in Valhalla, but in a sense, I was also liberated from my own narrative. Because I was forced to witness the stories of those beneath me.]
There, Mitra had watched countless incarnations and stars perish in the arena.
<@>[I remember one match in particular. It was a game where a Transcendent appeared.]
"Which Transcendent was it?"
<@>[A famous one. However, it wasn't the Transcendent who caught my eye. It was another incarnation on that team.]
It was a team led by a Transcendent, yet his attention had been drawn not to the powerhouse, but to a different incarnation.
"He must have been exceptionally strong then."
<@>[No, he wasn't as strong as the Transcendent. He wasn't weak, per se, but he lacked the exceptional talent that would normally attract the gaze of a god.]
It was a peculiar admission. An incarnation, neither as strong as a Transcendent nor possessing special genius, had captivated a Myth. Why?
<@>[It was a consistently hopeless match. The enemy team was far too powerful, and the Transcendent's team was decimated in minutes. The Transcendent was surprisingly resilient and put up a desperate fight, but that was all. It was a battle whose outcome was already written.]
The picture was forming in my mind. If a Transcendent of that caliber had lost, their opponent must have been a 'Giant Nebula'.
And even that Transcendent had died in the end.
Even though it was just a retelling of a past match, I felt a pang of regret, wondering if the Transcendent was someone I had once known.
<@>[Still, that incarnation refused to give up.]
"He didn't?"
<@>[He ran desperately, knowing there was no chance of victory.]
"I assume he was searching for the prophecy."
With a prophecy in hand, there is always a chance to turn the tables, no matter how unfavorable the odds. But Mitra shook his head.
<@>[That was beyond his reach. He just kept running, losing an arm, then a leg. One of his eyes was gouged out, and every nerve in his body was charred by lightning.]
Just the description was enough to convey the horrific reality that incarnation had faced. His determination to survive seemed as iron-clad as Yoo Joonghyuk’s.
"Was his tenacity what impressed you?"
<@>[No. Anyone can run when their life is on the line. It is a primal instinct.]
That was true. Everyone values their own existence. Some are overwhelmed by despair and surrender, while others cling to a fraying hope.
But the incarnation in the story wasn't trying to protect his own life.
<@>[He was shielding a child in his one remaining arm.]
I forgot to breathe for a moment, my focus entirely consumed by the narrative.
<@>[As you know, it is not easy to reach Scenario #85 and still fight to protect someone else.]
No matter how noble your start, those who reach Scenario #85 usually have their psyche worn down to nothing. Their emotions are frayed, and they lose the ability to care for anything but themselves.
"I take it the child was his own?"
<@>[No. There was no blood connection between them.]
It was a strange story—a truly bizarre tale, yet one that didn't sound entirely foreign to me.
Because in that moment...
"What happened to that incarnation?"
I already knew who that man was.
<@>[He succeeded.]
My heart hammered against my ribs. "He succeeded." That was how Mitra had phrased it. It was a strange way to describe the outcome of a skirmish, which usually ended in 'victory' or 'defeat'. But Mitra said he 'succeeded'.
<@>[He ran until he broke through the boundaries of the arena. He escaped the prison of the scenario that held him captive.]
A high-pitched ringing echoed in my ears. Finally, unable to contain it, I asked.
"By any chance... was that incarnation's name 'Lee Dansu'?"
Mitra paused, considering the name for a long moment.
<@>[Is he familiar to you?]
I nodded with great difficulty. Suppressing the storm in my chest, I forced out the next question.
"Yes. What happened to him after his escape?"
<@>[I do not know. He vanished beyond the reach of 'Valhalla Hall'.]
I tried my best to steady my breathing. Still, I couldn't mask the raw emotion welling up within me.
<&>「Dansu ahjussi is alive.」
He had fought the constellations, fled, and eventually—with a child in his arms—found the 'Missing Bush' and escaped the skirmish.
<@>[I still recall his response when the enemy constellations asked why he was so protective of that child.]
For a heartbeat, I could almost hear the vivid, gravelly voice of Dansu ahjussi.
<&>「"To you who ask why I must protect this child—even if I told you my reason, you would never understand."」
I felt breathless. It was unmistakable. It was Dansu ahjussi. Even after eight years, he was still the same man I remembered.
<@>[There is a sentence left by the recorder who watched over him until the very end.]
A line of text manifested in the air, pulsing with a faint light.
<&>「Those who protect their hearts to the very end may know the truth of the world without ever seeing its ■■.」
I thought about Dansu ahjussi. A man who had been searching for his daughter, Jiyoon.
His daughter was trapped in Asmodeus's theater. So, if he was protecting a child now... who was it?
<@>[And strangely enough, after reading that man's story, the original values within me shifted.]
"Changed?"
<@>[I know it sounds absurd. That a star who has reached the level of myth could suddenly change after reading the story of a single human.]
Mitra continued, speaking as if he knew I wouldn't believe him.
<@>[For a constellation that has lived for eons to change the direction of its light simply by reading a story... even I find it difficult to fathom.]
He was right. This wasn't just true for constellations, but for humans as well. Very few beings have their lives altered by a single narrative.
<&>「And yet, I know full well that such a story is not impossible.」
I already knew of several constellations that had read a story, loved it, and changed the course of their existence because of it.
And Mitra, too, was looking at the stars following him with a gaze similar to the ones I knew. They were the stars gathered in 'Valhalla Hall'.
<@>[Actually, I hadn't made up my mind until then. But now, I have. The other myth-grade constellations may call me a loser or a coward. I don't care. I no longer seek the approval of the Round Table. I don't care if the universe laughs at my choices.]
The stars of the 'Hall of Golden Dice'—stars from countless different nebulae—had decided to abandon their affiliations to follow him.
Mitra looked at them and spoke softly.
<@>[I still wonder about the ■■ of this world. But I have chosen not to be the one who confirms it.]
The dice in my hand vibrated with warmth.
Dansu ahjussi wasn't Kim Dokja. Yet, perhaps, he had accomplished something even more incredible. He had lived his life to the fullest and protected what was precious.
<@>[I intend to escape this '■■' hell with those who follow me. Just as that man once did.]
Ahjussi had succeeded in changing the starlight of a Great Myth.
Mitra, with a faint, knowing smile, spoke as if he already knew my next move.
<@>[Now, I will tell you where the 'Missing Bush' is located.]
