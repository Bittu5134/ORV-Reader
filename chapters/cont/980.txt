<title>980 Episode 59 What ending (1)
<&>「This is a story about the 'house'.」
***
Mitra immediately told me the location of the 'Missing Bush'.
"How did you know I was looking for that bush?"
Mitra merely smiled vaguely at my question. In fact, just because he didn't answer didn't mean I couldn't guess. After all, this 'battlefield' was practically his sanctuary. If Mitra had wanted to, he could probably eavesdrop on every conversation taking place in the 'Valhalla Hall'.
If the opponent hadn't been 'Asmodeus' and the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', Mitra, a myth-grade constellation, wouldn't have been pushed back so much.
<&>「The map of the 'super-large battlefield' Mitra had given me became clear in my mind.」
I bowed again, grateful for Mitra's kindness. Mitra, watching me, said,
<!>[That's all I can offer. I don't know if the one you're looking for is there.]
"Didn't the incarnation you mentioned earlier escape through the Missing Thicket?"
<!>[That's right. But even if the exit is the same, there's no guarantee you'll arrive at the same place.]
That's right. An exit is just an exit. There's no way to know which way the being that exited took.
<!>[More than anything, the Missing Thicket is a portal based on the wennies, so there's no guarantee the exit location will be safe.]
A portal of the wennies. For a moment, I considered asking the 'Wenny King' for help, but then decided against it. Coming all this way and relying on the help of such a great being would cost me dearly.
"I forgot to ask, but when you said you'd escape from the 'Hell of ■■', was that some kind of metaphor?"
Mitra hesitated for a moment before answering my question.
<!>[You know it's rude to ask that, don't you?]
A typical characteristic of 'myth-grade constellations' belatedly came to mind.
<&>「Constellations that have become 'myths' have a tendency to equivocate.」
While equivocating is a common idiom among constellations, the myth-grade constellations were particularly prone to it.
<&>「"Those bastards always speak with metaphors and allusions. That's how they can freely deviate from their [declarations]."」
In a world where everything is made of stories, the words of a great being hold greater narrative value. Therefore, Han Sooyoung explained, constellations that have reached myth-grade must be adept at all forms of rhetoric, allusion, and metaphor to remain free from promises.
<&>「"It's their characteristic to misinterpret others at will. That's why you need to ask them questions in clear language."」
I ignored Mitra's discomfort and decided to follow Han Sooyoung's advice.
"I'm T, so I'm a bit sensitive about things like this."
<!>[T? What do you mean?]
Actually, I said it casually. I've never taken an MBTI test or anything like that.
"It's just that we should avoid using words that are difficult to understand."
<!>[…]
"What you said sounded like a declaration to me of your intention to escape this scenario. So, I guess that means you're going to use 'the missing bush'. Am I interpreting it correctly?"
<!>[I'm considering it.]
Unlike the anecdote about Dansu ahjussi, who had declared his escape from the 'Hell of ■■', with a touching mantra, Mitra's expression remained somewhat ambiguous.
I understood Mitra's intentions and smiled.
"Good. Then I guess I can accompany you to that bush."
Only then did Mitra realize my intention and exclaimed in admiration.
<!>[I truly admire your tongue.]
"Thank you for the compliment."
If I was going to build a cooperative relationship with Mitra anyway, it would be better to join him from now until we entered the thicket. If he accompanied me on my journey, Papyrus and other constellations of the nebulae, who would be waiting for an opportunity, would be unable to approach recklessly.
Of course, that wasn't the only goal.
<&>「If necessary, let Mitra enter the 'Missing Thicket' first.」
As Mitra had said, the safety of entering the thicket wasn't yet guaranteed. Therefore, throwing him, a myth-grade constellation, into the thicket first could be an effective improvisation. After all, he was also the master of the 'Resurrection Festival', so he wouldn't die easily even if he was attacked.
Mitra gave me a strange glare, as if he knew my intentions, but I feigned ignorance and said,
"By the way, how do you use the dice?"
<!>[You'll know naturally when the 'Round Table' opens.]
"When does it open?"
<@>[That…]
The moment Mitra was about to answer, a light spark enveloped his entire body.
<!>[It seems the 'Round Table' doesn't want me to speak.]
I briefly suspected that the spark might have been created intentionally by Mitra, but it felt like a waste to press him when he didn't want to answer anyway.
"Then there's no problem with accompanying me, right?"
<!>[It doesn't matter. However, there seems to be something I need to take care of first.]
Something he needs to take care of?
The moment I turned my head, following Mitra's gaze, something I had forgotten came to mind.
About twenty paces away from us, a constellation of a gigantic nebula still lingered nearby.
<!>[Child of the <Emperor>, do you intend to confront me?]
A constellation belonging to the <Emperor>. It was 'Ye', the Sun Hunter. He aimed his red bow in our direction, glaring at us with a steady gaze. Mitra frowned, seemingly displeased with the Sun Hunter's appearance, and opened his mouth.
<!>[If you're going to continue to be abusive...]
"Just a moment."
After restraining Mitra, I quickly approached the Sun Hunter. Even though I was within striking distance, the Sun Hunter stared at me without any reaction.
I experimentally waved my hand in front of his eyes. His pupils remained unresponsive. As expected, it was as I thought.
"This guy fainted?"
Perhaps it was natural.
The Sun Hunter's White Arrow required a tremendous amount of probability every time it was used.
In particular, the 'Fourth Finger of the Emperor' he used was an arrow that greatly increased the burden on the user depending on the target's 'level'.
Since it interfered with the 'Record Contract' of a 'Mythical Constellation' and the highest-ranking recorder, the moment the arrow struck, the Sun Hunter's incarnation would have been hit with a tremendous backlash of probability. The other <Emperor> constellations, either abandoned him or lost in the previous battle, were nowhere to be found.
The sight of the Sun Hunter, standing unconscious in his character pajamas, was quite amusing, so I observed him for a moment.
My eyes then fell on the 'White Arrow' in his hand.
Wait a minute. Could this be it?

"I wonder what's going on in your head."
Anna Croft, who had overheard me agreeing to accompany Mitra, seemed to have grown weary of surprise.
"You haven't forgotten, have you? He's the president of Valhalla Hall."
"Yes, I know."
No matter how much he eloquently spoke, Mitra was ultimately responsible for the death of Kim Anna-ssi before me hundreds of times.
"Do you really think you can trust someone like that?"
"Is there a constellation you can trust?"
I watched Mitra from a distance, tending to his subordinates. He's pretending not to know, but he's definitely using his power to eavesdrop on our conversation.
"He probably has his own agenda. It's just a mutually beneficial situation, so don't take it too seriously."
Perhaps sensing that I didn't trust Mitra too much, Anna Croft nodded with a slightly softened expression and asked.
"By the way, what are you doing?"
"Oh, this?"
For your information, I was currently rubbing the 'Ten Fingers of God' I'd taken from the unconscious Sun Hunter against the 'Thoughts of Almost Everything'.
<!>[Item, 'Thoughts of Almost Everything''s Mimicry Proficiency is increasing!]
Originally, it was difficult to acquire a mimetic form from a relic of this level through 'Thoughts'. However, 'Thoughts' had evolved considerably over time, and now, even from a mythical constellation, it wasn't impossible to acquire a form.
<!>[The item, 'Thoughts of Almost Everything', is increasing its mimicry proficiency!]
In particular, the acquisition condition for this 'Mimicry Form' is 'rubbing the items a thousand times'.
This is a good acquisition condition.
<!>[The relic, 'God's Ten Fingers', lets out a painful cry!]
As expected, because it was a relic of the Five Emperors, I felt the arrows convulse in my hand with each rub.
I suppressed the tingling sensation and continued to rub the arrows. And finally...
<!>['Mimicry Form' successfully acquired!]
A completion message flashed before my eyes.
I heard the Sun Hunter suddenly snap back to his senses.
<@>[Huh!]
The Sun Hunter, his eyes brightening, checked the relic in my hand, and hurriedly asked.
<@>[What are you doing?]
"Oh, I was just looking at the arrows."
In reality, I was stealing them. I smiled shamelessly and handed him back the 'Ten Fingers of God'. The Sun Hunter, dumbfounded, took the arrow back, examined it carefully, and asked incredulously.
"How did you get hold of this? This relic is meant to be wielded only by the chosen ones."
Of course. Relics of this level are inherently forbidden to be wielded by anyone but the 'permitted beings'.
The 'Ten Fingers of God' possessed the 'Thousand-year Interrogation', a type of prohibition that inflicted intense psychological pain on the user. Of course, it was practically nonexistent for me.
<!>[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall', is activated!]
The Sun Hunter, unaware of my circumstances, thought to himself for a moment, then nodded in admiration.
<!>[Perhaps the Emperor held you in such high esteem. Who would have thought he would entrust you with his fingers.]
In reality, I had committed the atrocity of forcibly rubbing 'thoughts' on his fingers.
Fortunately, the emperor seemed busy and didn't seem to care much about what touched his fingers.
"Anyway, what happened to the other comrades?"
<@>[Comrades?]
"Those who came with us."
The Sun Hunter looked around and answered with a somber voice.
<!>[Most of them seem to have escaped. Some must have been repatriated to the higher-level scenario. The return order was given during the battle.]
Return order?
<!>[There was a problem with the higher-level scenario, so an emergency summons was given.]
I don't know what happened, but it seems something unusual is unfolding up there.
"Anyway, thank you for your help. Thanks to you, I survived."
I was sincere. If he hadn't shown up, the battle with Asmodeus would have been quite difficult.
But the Sun Hunter received my thanks with a somewhat indifferent expression.
<!>[No. I, too, had a purpose, and I simply helped you.]
"Are you planning to take me to the <Emperor>?"
<!>[No such intention.]
"Wasn't that your mission?"
The Sun Hunter blinked at my question, then slowly shook his head and said.
<!>[If you don't receive payment for the mission, you have no obligation to carry it out.]
The Sun Hunter's mission was to take me to the <Emperor>'s battlefield. And the price he agreed to receive was the whereabouts of his transcendent friends.
<!>[Didn't you promise to tell me the whereabouts of my friends?]
Of course I intended to. But I hadn't expected you to accept my offer so coolly, so I was somewhat touched.
"Yes. I plan to let you know."
Since there was still some time before we departed for the 'Missing Bush', I briefly told him about the whereabouts of the Transcendents I knew.
The first piece of information I shared was about the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, Namgung Minyeong. From the events in the Fear Realm, to the 'New Murim District', and even the 'World Tree Project' concocted by the constellations.
<!>[I see. Breaking the Sky Sword Saint...]
The Sun Hunter listened intently to my story, sometimes saddened, sometimes enraged. Perhaps his emotional reactions were somewhat interesting, as Jung Heewon, who was listening nearby, asked,
"Are you really Master’s friend?"
<!>[I don't know about her, but I think so.]
Perhaps it was because of his uncharacteristically reserved yet cautious tone. Or perhaps it was because she was meeting a constellation who remembered Breaking the Sky Sword Saint for the first time. Jung Heewon finished telling the Sun Hunter the rest of the story about Breaking the Sky Sword Saint on my behalf.
The Sun Hunter listened calmly to Jung Heewon's story, occasionally nodding or expressing his sympathy. Just by listening, I could sense how precious the Transcendents were to him.
<!>[So, the story of Breaking the Sky Sword Saint is with you now?]
"Yes."
<!>[So that's why I felt so familiar with you…]
The Sun Hunter gazed at me for a moment with longing eyes, then quickly forced himself to calm down and asked again.
<!>[Then, what happened to Jungyeong and Kyrgios?]
"I don't know much about that either. However, it seems that Master Kyrgios has gone to the 'main battlefield'."
<@>[I see...]
Judging by the Sun Hunter's reaction, he seemed to have expected it to some extent.
"Are you going to meet him?"
<!>[The end of the world is near, so I should drink my last glass with my friends.]
It's incredible that there are still constellations, even in the <Emperor>, that seek out friends for such romantic reasons.
This time, I couldn't help but ask sincerely.
"If you happen to meet them, could you let me know?"
I thought it might be a bit much to ask, but the Sun Hunter nodded readily.
<!>[I will. It's fate that I met my friend's disciple. Kyrgios and Junkyung will be very proud of you.]
"No."
This concluded my conversation with both Mitra and the Sun Hunter.
Now, all that really remained was to head to the 'Lost Bush'.
I was about to ask if the Sun Hunter would join us. In that moment, he asked me in a strange voice.
<!>[But what do you plan to do with that?]
That?
<!>[If you want, I can cut off its lifeline.]
I hurriedly stopped the Sun Hunter, who was once again grasping his bow.
"No, there's no need."
In the direction he aimed his bow, the Black Flame Dragon's gigantic form still hadn't completely vanished. I don't know why its descent hadn't been lifted yet, but there was no point in provoking it here.
<!>[Why? That evil dragon intended to harm you.]
"It wasn't his will, I suppose."
<!>[It wasn't his will?]
"After all, it's the stories that determine existence."
The Sun Hunter's eyes sparkled, as if he found my perspective amusing.
<!>[So you're saying stories themselves are wrong? Do you believe the evil stories or good stories he possesses represent his existence?]
Of course, I know stories don't determine everything about existence.
After all, actions are a combination of will and stories. However, I... I just wanted to defend the Black Flame Dragon.
"I don't know about that. But if it's a false story, maybe I can correct it."
For the time being, I was the recorder of the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon'. That meant I could also interfere with his records from now on. Perhaps I could unleash my powers as a recorder here and learn why he came to this world and what he'd been through.
<!>[The story of the constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', reacts to you.]
However, as I approached, the Black Flame Dragon's incarnation body began to disappear as if it had been waiting for me. Thinking it was a disappointing ending, I was about to turn around, but then something strange caught my eye.
<&>「My heart pounded.」
In the place where the Black Dragon's massive body had vanished in a puff of pitch-black smoke, someone I knew was fast asleep.
