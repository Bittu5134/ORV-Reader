<title>655 Episode 19 People of the Past (7)
"Ahjussi. Run away. Hurry."
Shin Yoosoung urgently pulled my sleeve. The child's eyes blinked intermittently with a golden light.
"Quickly!"
Today's Dansu ahjussi is dangerous.
"I will not kill you. I won't kill you."
<!>[The story 'Relentless Murim Master' warns you.]
The spirit of the Murim people was warning me. If I deal with Dansu ahjussi now, I will die.
"Ahjussi! Wake up! Please!"
He did not respond at all to my calls. He just came towards us step by step, with heavy steps.
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
Dansu ahjussi wasn't looking at me. In the place where ahjussi’s eyes had been, only pitch-black darkness swayed emptily.
<!>[Someone activated the 'trap switch'.]
<!>[The dungeon rearrangement time will be readjusted.]
<!>[Dungeon relocation will begin in 10 minutes.]
To make matters worse, the relocation time was advanced.
Maybe it was the work of the 7 kings of Seoul who ran away earlier.
<!>[After a while, the entire dungeon will be engulfed in flames.]
<!>[Find the 'Safe Zone'.]
The dungeon floor vibrated lightly, and I felt faint heat at my ankles. If 5 more minutes pass like this, the whole area will be covered with a hot fire.
When I thought so, my mind went dark.
Let's assume Shin Yoosoung and I manage to escape. Then, what happens to the Dansu ahjussi?
<!>[Participants with Star Jewels are immune from the flames caused by 'Rearrangement'.]
A sigh of relief came out.
Now, Dansu ahjussi has absorbed five star jewels.
At least this relocation will not change the life or death of ahjussi.
—Ahjussi.
Shin Yoosoung shook me once again.
I had to make a decision.
"Dansu ahjussi. I'll be back soon."
"Looking for someone."
Now things have changed.
It is said that he is immune from the flames, but Shin Yoosoung and I were not.
Still unable to hear me, Dansu ahjussi pursed his lips.
"Jiyoon."
"Yes. We decided to find Jiyoon."
Jiyoon. Ahjussi steps slowed down for an instant.
I continued to speak with clenched fists.
"I told you I would definitely find her. Do you remember?"
Dansu ahjussi, who had been hesitant, moved his head very slowly. I couldn't tell if that meant he understood what I was saying or if it was just a coincidence.
I suppressed my surging heart and grabbed Shin Yoosoung's hand.
"I'll definitely be back."
I just started running.
<!>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' mourns the tragedy of the incarnation Lee Dansu.]
<!>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' laments the cruelty of the scenario.]
<!>[Constellation 'Bald General of Justice' wipes his head.]
I will never let you die like this.
<!>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' supports your fight.]
Dansu ahjussi didn't come after us.
<!>[After 8 minutes 'Rearrangement' will begin.]
We immediately set out to search for a safe area. To save Dansu ahjussi, we must first survive.
Shin Yoosong, who was looking at the left and right aisles with me, opened her mouth.
"Ahjussi."
"Yes."
"Is that person close to you?"
Without a moment to think, my mouth answered first.
"Yes."
I also let go.
Close person.
That's what I was thinking of Dansu ahjussi.
For a moment, a weak spark flowed from Shin Yoosoung's body. I looked back in amazement.
Shin Yoosoung avoided my gaze and lowered her head.
"I see..."
Shin Yoosoung's eyes briefly shimmered in gold.
What are these gold eyes?
Did Shin Yoosoung in the main story have such an ability?
I couldn't remember it well. As far as I know, the gold eyes are a characteristic of Yoo Jonghyuk, who has [Sage's Eyes].
Come to think of it, where is Yoo Jonghyuk now? It was time for him to save Yoo Mia and return to Gwanghwamun, but there was no news yet.
<!>['Rearrangement' will begin after 7 minutes.]
Damn, now is not the time to think about Yoo Jonghyuk.
Little by little, my mind was quickened. If I stayed like this, I was going to die before I could meet Yoo Jonghyuk again.
However, no matter how much I searched, I couldn't find a 'safe area'.
In 'Ways of Survival', it was written to take an incarnation with the [Guide] attribute or the [Find the maze] skill in preparation for such a situation.
But neither I nor Shin Yoosoung had those characteristics or skills.
<!>['Rearrangement' will begin in 6 minutes.]
I quickly checked the stardust we had.
<!>[Star dust obtained so far: 314]
If you get a 'star jewel', you can endure the hellfire of 'rearrangement'.
If I collect additional star dust and make a star jewel, at least Shin Yoosoung might be able to be saved.
The problem is that there is only one way to quickly obtain dust powder.
<!>[The other incarnations must be killed.]
<!>[After  5 minutes 'Relocation' will start.]
It was then that Shin Yoosoung's voice was heard.
"Ahjussi. Over there."
About ten paces ahead, from the inside of the aisle on the right, a faint stream of light was pouring out.
We ran straight to the corner of the road where the light came out.
<!>[A safe area has been found.]
Fortunately, there was a safe area left.
However, there were those who occupied the 'safe area' before us.
"Oh, we met again."
A troubled voice.
It was Gu Taesung, one of the 7 kings of Seoul, whom I had met earlier.
"I'm sorry, but there aren't enough seats here. Find another place."
Gu Taesung was in a safe area with two of his subordinates.
A green circle in the size of 1 pyeong, reminiscent of the 'Green Zone of Chungmuro'.
At the top of the circle, the currently accessible places were marked.
<!>[Available capacity: 3/4]
One place left.
There are five people in total, including us.
It was then that Gu Taesung's eyes changed.
"Hmm? Hold on."
His eyes were looking at Shin Yoosoung. When I reflexively hid Shin Yoosoung behind my back, he moved his lips slightly and started talking to someone in a 'group chat'. Then he asked with a smile on his face.
"What's that kid's name?"
Did he know Shin Yoosoung?
"I have no obligation to inform you."
Then, Gu Taesung smiled.
"I don't think it's a situation to be so bold, right?
<!>[After 4 minutes 'Relocating' will begin.]
4 minutes left.
Gu Taesung opened his mouth first, as if he had made up his mind on something.
"I will take the child."
For a moment, my head went blank.
Where did I hear that line?
Gu Taesung chuckled and looked back at his subordinates.
"Didn't I just act like Yoo Jonghyuk?"
"Yoo Jonghyuk? Are you talking about the king?"
"No. What do you guys know?"
Gu Taesung, slightly frowning, looked back at me. A completely different look from before.
"Kill him. And bring the kid."
As if he had waited, each of his subordinates handed over a sword and a spear.
I looked at the dangerously approaching guys for a while and asked.
"Did you guys make Dansu ahjussi like that?"
At my question, the subordinates turned to each other.
"Dansu ahjussi? Who is he talking about?"
"Isn’t he talking about the old man who was talking about his daughter?"
"Ah, you mean the sacrifice."
Sacrifice.
"Well, we did feed him star jewels. It's honestly not our fault. We only gave it to him because he wanted a star jewel, right?"
"That's right. Anyway, if a person has a lot of greed—"
The moment I heard the voice full of ridicule, I felt something cut off inside me.
The [Blade of Faith] is activated!
"What is that?"
The radiance of conviction that illuminates the darkness.
Gu Taesung seemed to have noticed what this item was.
"No way…"
I swung my sword without  hesitation. Surprised, the subordinates swung their swords at me.
<!>[Story, 'The Tenacious Murim Master' stutters.]
However, to me who has the legend of the ark of the dragon, their trajectory was as easy to avoid as a child's toy knife.
The blue, white and blue sword cut through the air. With the sound of the cross section being neatly cut, the two men fell to the floor without even leaving a final word.
However, thanks to his subordinates buying a moment, Gu Taesung seemed to have finished his preparations.
<!>[Incarnation 'Gu Taesung' activates 'Weapon Improvement Lv.4'.]
<!>[Incarnation 'Gu Taesung' activates 'Advanced Swordsmanship Lv.3'!]
<!>[Incarnation 'Gu Taesung activates the characteristic effect!]
<!>['King's Spirit' effect activates!]
Gu Taesung's sponsor is 'the founding of Hannam-gun'.
In other words, he is the incarnation of Gyeonhun, the king of later Baekje.
However, despite the pouring skill activation message, I was calm.
<&>「I didn’t feel like I was going to lose at all.」
"How do you have Broken Faith?"
"I picked it up."
"What?"
I immediately started pushing him. The batting stick of the Dragon Head Ark unfolds through 'Broken Faith', and in the magic of 'Circulation Delay' [Baekjeong Ganggi], I launched a wave of attacks.
Gu Taesung, who had been taking backward steps in succession, spat out an astonishment.
"Who are you? How can you be like this…"
He might be surprised.
Because there's no one like me among the characters he knows.
<!>[Incarnation 'Gu Taesung' activates 'Relentless Guts Lv.3'!]
But surely the 7 kings are the 7 kings.
As the battle lengthened, he was following my movements little by little.
It was because of his skill, [Relentless Guts].
The longer the battle drags on, the worse it gets for me. In the end, I too have to throw the odds.
"I heard you were imitating Yoo Jonghyuk earlier."
"What?"
<!>[The sub-skill, 'Enhance Sentence' is activated!]
<!>[You can enter your actions.]
<!>[The action you enter is 'reinforced'.]
<!>[The current enhancement level is level 1.]
I entered the sentence without hesitation.
<&>「Cheon Inho used 'Incite'.」
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite' is enhanced!]
<!>[Incite is temporarily awakened.]
<!>[You can incite yourself to imitate any character you want!]
I remembered 'Yoo Jonghyuk' in the 3rd round that Kim Dokja met.
The strong and ruthless king of the 3rd round.
I know.
Now, I will not be able to absorb the skills of Yoo Jonghyuk, but 'Omniscient Reader' is a very long novel, and among them, there will be a Yoo Jonghyuk that I can imitate.
<&>「Finally, the sleeping prince has awakened from a deep sleep.」
Gu Taesung gave orders, probably feeling something out of the ordinary.
"It's here! Everyone come this way! Kill this guy!"
At the same time as he said that, more than a dozen incarnations appeared from the back of the aisle.
All of them were subordinates of Gu Taesung.
Apparently, they were the ones who called over the group chat earlier.
​Gu Taesung's lips seemed to be filled with a smile once again.
Seeing that guy, I opened my mouth.
"I am."
A sword of old age falling over his head.
"I am Yoo Jonghyuk from the 3rd round, who cut down the apostle."
The moment Gu Taesung opened his eyes in surprise, a faint spark flowed through my body.
Goosebumps ran down my spine, and my sense of time and space slowed down.
<&>「Uncomfortable feeling, like wearing ill-fitting clothes. The height of the line of sight that is subtly different from usual, and the five different senses.」
This is Yoo Jonghyuk’s view.
I could feel my muscles contracting strongly. A power beyond the limits of my body was stirring within me.
<!>[Incite activates!]
Only the 3rd round.
It was also Yoo Jonghyuk, who had a lower overall ability than me in the early days and now, but it was so difficult to imitate him.
<&>「"Don't rest and move."」
The voice of the pajeon swordsman echoed in my head.
<&>「"Is a guy who wants to acquire the Fiery Sword of the Underworld broken down from just that much?"」
Perhaps this is Yoo Jonghyuk’s memory.
<&>「"Fifty years, if not ten years. If you can't do it in 50 years, work hard with the spirit that you will cut it in 100 years. Build up over the years. Engrave in your body and mind the memories that no star can destroy you."」
Maybe it was natural.
Even if it was only the third round, Yoo Jonghyuk lived an overwhelming time that was incomparable to me.
He is the incarnation of the highest peak who has already risen to the Transcendental Seat in the second round.
He was a being who had  trained for a hundred years in 'Time Fault' .
Blood gushed out of my nose with the sound of a push shot. It was as if a book's worth of type had been crumpled into a sheet of A4 paper, and it felt like my brain, unable to withstand the pressure, would explode.
But I persevered.
I know that it is impossible to truly become that 'Yoo Jonghyuk'. But.
<&>「At that moment, 'I' realized who I was.」
At least for a moment.
<&>「My hand grasps the hilt as if doing something that has been repeated a million times over. The feeling of the fingers wrapped around the grip was unfamiliar.」
If it is 'Yoo Jonghyuk' in a single moment when he killed the apostles in Chungmuro.
<&>「"I am Yoo Jonghyuk."」
Murderous intent and anger welled up in my head. Resentment towards the people behind and hatred towards the constellations.
The dead comrades.
The world that was abandoned by Yoo Jonghyuk and could not be saved was entangling my entire body like a chain.
This is the curse of the regressor.
Yoo Jonghyuk has always lived through these things.
I could feel Shin Yoosoung's gaze from behind.
I said without looking back.
—Get down, Shin Yoosoung.
Shin Yoosoung reflexively lowered her waist and my sword moved at the same time.
<!>[The constellation 'Hannam County Founder' shouts to avoid!]
There is no way to avoid this sword.
<&>「One step was so natural, even beautiful.」
Because it was the most perfect swordsman Kim Dokja knew.
