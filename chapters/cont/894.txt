<title>894 Episode 49 tls123 (4)
For an hour after that, I was beaten up here and there by Han Sooyoung. Maybe because I was beaten up so much, I could answer Han Sooyoung’s questions right away.
"What major did you choose?"
"Creative Writing."
"Oh, you must have won some awards at the 100th-day celebration when you were young?"
"Only a reading award. Actually, I never learned writing separately, so I wasn’t very good at writing."
"Really? But you must have learned some things when you went to college, right?"
"Yes, I did."
Actually, there were people who taught me. Anyway, I graduated from the Creative Writing Department, and I took novel classes from various professors. However, if you ask me if I learned writing from them, I don’t know what to say.
But there is one professor I remember.
<&>「"■■-ah, are you having a hard time these days?"」
It was around the time when I had not received any requests since my lucky debut.
<&>「"Have you ever thought about writing web novels?"」
At that time, I was still not yet fully into pure literature, so I was depressed because I thought the professor's words meant, "You have no talent at all, so get out of the literary world." But now that I look back, that advice meant, "If you keep dying here, your life will be ruined."
When I think of my peers who are having a hard time in the literary world, drinking, I want to give my professor a tip for his wisdom, but unfortunately, I can't even remember his name anymore. It was because I lost many of the memories I had while going through the 'Fear Realm'.
"At first, it was hard to adapt to writing web novels."
"Well, it must have been hard if you had come from pure literature. The writing style is very different."
"I didn't know I would struggle that much. But I graduated from the Department of Creative Writing."
"That's possible. In fact, our industry has a relatively low barrier to entry, right? Anyone can write if they have a keyboard."
It didn't feel real at all that I was talking about web novels with Han Sooyoung.
"Yes. Anyway, I had a hard time at first."
"No one is good at writing from the beginning. Although there are geniuses sometimes."
"You weren't good at writing at first either?"
"I'm that genius?"
I smiled bitterly as I watched Han Sooyoung smiling proudly.
Even though she said that, I knew that she was the one who worked harder than anyone else.
After all, she was someone who had serialized a novel that only one person read for over 10 years.
"Come on, get up. We have to keep going."
I sighed and got up from my seat.
"Are you going to hit me again?"
"Who said you'd just get hit? I told you to hit me too. Then I'll answer the questions you want?"
"Easier said than done."
"You only need to hit once, is that so hard?"
"It's harder than when I first started reading web novels."
She said one hit, but from my perspective, it seemed like Han Sooyoung was just beating me up under the pretense of training.
"Is it because you've been studying pure literature? Your skill usage is so old-fashioned."
"Honestly, how much pure literature have you read?"
"Your basic stamina is also really poor."
"I've never seen a writer with such good stamina."
"For a writer, stamina that doesn't get tired even after working for three days and nights is a given. In my time—"
I quickly used the story.
<!>[Story fragment, 'Way of the Wind', begins its storytelling!]
<!>[Way of the Wind, condensed into 'Unbreakable Faith', swirled and created a fierce sword wind.]
Han Sooyoung muttered as if it was interesting.
"Oh, this one has good application?"
Even so, my [Way of the Wind] didn’t even brush Han Sooyoung’s collar.
I bit my lips and swung my sword again and again.
Han Sooyoung kept asking questions while dodging my strikes here and there.
"What’s the name of this skill?"
"It’s [Way of the Wind], right?"
"That’s the skill name. [Way of the Wind] isn’t used like that originally."
"I didn’t give it a name."
I’m not Killer King, so I wouldn’t have named every skill I used like "Dark Spinning Breaker".
But Han Sooyoung looked at me as if I was pathetic.
"Isn’t that skill your original? But you didn’t even give it a name?"
"Why do you have to give it something like that?"
"Because it becomes stronger with a name."
I couldn’t understand what she meant.
It becomes stronger with a name?
"Extinction Sword (멸화검)."
As Han Sooyoung muttered softly, a long purple sword spurted out from above the dagger she was holding.
I stared at the shape of the sword spur and asked.
"Extinction Sword? Isn't that just [Black Flame] stretched out and pulled out?"
"Extinction Sword Form 1, Annihilation." (멸화검 제1식, 멸화개아.)
Han Sooyoung shouted the name of the technique without paying attention to my tackle. Following that, the form of [After Flame] wrapped around Han Sooyoung's entire body like a flower bud, and soon deflected all the blade storms created by [Way of the Wind].
<!>[The Constellation, 'Maritime War God's', eyes sparkle!]
<!>[The Constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', is happy to see 'Extinction Sword' for the first time in a long time.]
Messages from the Constellations pouring down from the air.
I felt like I could understand Han Sooyoung's words that I had to give it a name.
"Form 2, Extinction." (제2식. 멸화분분.)
Following that, a flower bud made of [Black Flame] opened. The sight of a flower made of pure purple energy blooming was captivating just by looking at it.
The moment my gaze was captured by that scenery, the purple energy that had bloomed like petals scattering fragrance began to pour out in all directions.
"Tch."
I hurriedly activated the 'Blade of Faith', but it was not enough to counter the countless energy of [Black Flame]. In an instant, small scars appeared on my arms and legs.
I was purely astonished by the overwhelming difference in skill.
Just as my skill relied on the source of [Way of the Wind], her skill was also based on [Black Flame]. However, the way she used [Black Flame] was much more sophisticated and delicate than how I used [Way of the Wind].
Han Sooyoung shook her head and said.
"It's not a difference in skill. It's a difference in imagination."
A difference in imagination.
"Even if you handle the story in the same way, the image of the technique changes completely depending on how you name it."
I realized belatedly what she meant. It was true that I had only given it a name, but the image of the technique felt much clearer.
A crouching flower bud and a blooming petal fluttering in the wind.
The established name creates a framework for imagination and stimulates the curiosity of the Constellations.
<!>[The Constellation, 'Goryeo's Swordsman', feels the longing for the Murim.]
Then.
"Pungrang Island (풍랑섬)."
I swung my sword with all my might. The magical power in my body drained away and the shape of the blade storm created by [Way of the Wind] changed.
I thought of the wolf that had taught me [Way of the Wind]. The wolf of Immutar galloping across the plains of Chronos. The wolves running toward the sunset began to roar all at once.
Kudduddud! The energy of [Way of the Wind] and [Black Flame] collided, creating a whirlwind.
This side was slightly pushed back.
I continued to supply my magical power and added [Baekcheongganggi] to the blade.
"Baekrang Island (백랑섬)."
<?>Somebody, help? T~T …Anyway, I put the names in Korean here just in case.The manes of the roaring wolves scattered silver. Some wolves were cut to death by the flower petals, but some wolves managed to bite the flower petals. With a sound of sparks, the magical power was canceled in the air, and [Black Flame] and [Way of the Wind] scattered into ash.
Han Sooyoung smiled as if she was amazed.
"You have good learning ability. Is 'Wind' (풍랑) borrowed from Lycaon's name?"
<?>??? T~T idk"That's right."
I then activated other stories and skills one after another.
<!>[The story, 'Tenacious Martial Arts Master', begins its storytelling!]
The Dragon's Head Ark of Opening, a story obtained from Cheon Gae.
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Nakgak Breath Lv. 10', is activated!]
The long breath sucked in by [Nakgak Breath] strengthened the magic circulation efficiency of 'Circulation Delay'. It was the result of practicing the skill linkage that the Demon King of Salvation had pointed out before.
Han Sooyoung, who had exchanged a hundred or so combinations with me in an instant, nodded and said.
"The skill set isn't that great, but the linkage isn't bad. You worked hard, didn't you?"
I felt elated for no reason.
I worked hard. It felt so good to be recognized for that.
It felt like a certain sense that I had long forgotten was awakening again. Even though it was just clashing swords and telling stories that I had accumulated.
"Don't get excited for no reason. We still have a long way to go. Is there anything else you know how to do?"
"I can use Kim Dokja's power."
Currently, I have accepted the 'First Kim Dokja'—the 'Demon King of Salvation'—and the 'Second Kim Dokja'—the 'King of Fear'. I was able to borrow their powers that remained in the [Fourth Wall] with the power of 'Heir of the Eternal Name'.
"Try it."
"Not now."
"Why?"
"I don't know."
<!>[Currently, a part of the 'Fourth Wall' is being restored.]
<!>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', refuses your request.]
It seems that the [Fourth Wall] is not in good condition. The guy Heir is not listening to me either.
Han Sooyoung asked, licking her lips.
"This is difficult. What else?"
"I can also use Cheon Inho's techniques."
"[Incite]?"
"Yes."
"Then try that."
Despite Han Sooyoung's suggestion, I hesitated a little this time. Because I experienced Cheon Inho's '40th Round' in the Time Fault of the Fear Realm, my [Incite] had become quite strong. Right now, I was confident that even a mediocre Constellation could kneel with just [Incite].
"You'll get hurt."
"Me?"
Han Sooyoung said with a smirk.
"Want to make a bet? If your incite works even a little, I'll grant you one wish."
"Wish?"
"Yes."
"Don't regret it."
I opened my mouth without hesitation.
"You."
I briefly thought about what [Incite] I should do. Since it's my first time, I'll go with something safe.
"You're worse at writing than me."
<!>[Exclusive skill, Incite Lv.???', is activated!]
Tsutsutsutsu.
A spark flew in the air.
Han Sooyoung stared at me blankly. Then, I felt a strong backlash in my incarnation body.
<!>[The story, 'One Who Rewrites Fate', offsets your probability aftershock.]
As expected, I failed.
"Would that spell work?"
"You never know."
"The basics aren't right. Before [inciting], you should analyze what kind of emotional state the other person is in."
I was about to say that I analyzed a little bit, but stopped myself.
"If I had even the slightest thought that I might lose to you, would that [inciting] work?"
"Then what should I have [incited] you?"
"You have to find that out . Other than this? No more?"
"No more."
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.???', is activated!]
Han Sooyoung's smile deepened.
"That's pretty good. I almost believed it."
"What a shame."
Actually, Han Sooyoung was right. I still had one more important asset left.
"You, do you have a 'Giant Tale'?"
"I do, but I don't know how to use it yet. To be exact, it’s in a state where it can’t be used."
"What does that mean?"
I thought about it for a moment and decided to be honest.
"It’s not just 'skills' that need a name to be used properly."
"You haven’t gotten a name for it yet, have you?"
"Yes."
"When did you get the giant story?"
"Well, it’s been quite some time."
"Then, the <Star Stream> must have given it to you?"
Han Sooyoung approached me with a puzzled expression and grabbed my wrist. Her story began to rush into me.
And as if to oppose her story, a strong energy boiled inside me.
The 'giant story' was resisting Han Sooyoung’s story. As if it was rejecting all of her stories.
"Look at this?"
Han Sooyoung, who had been briefly confronting the story, opened her mouth as if she found it interesting.
"This guy is refusing to be given a name?"
