<title>607 Episode 11 Artwork (2)
"Run."
With Killer King's signal, we ran in the rain.
"Five raptors ahead."
At my signal, Killer King's younger sister, Literature Girl 64 stepped forward.
<!>[White and Blue Steel entwined in the claws of both hands, accelerating in an instant, she snapped the necks of the five raptors like millets.]
"A 7th grade ahead!"
<!>[A 7th grade earth dragon, ‘Tyrannosaurus Rex’, has appeared!]
Grade 7 Earth Dragon, Tyrannosaurus Rex.
The one who got stronger by receiving the power of the black moon knocked down all the hardwoods in front.
It rushed this way.
The literary girl didn't back down and ran to the front of Tyranno.
<!>[Incarnation, 'Lee Seyeon', activates the skill 'Battle Action Mode'!]
Lee Seyeon. It was the name of the person possessed by Literature Girl 64.
Since I don't remember her name, this must be an ordinary extra.
The moment the T-Rex's paw fell on Literature Girl 64's head, she shouted.
"Brother, now!"
"I get it."
<!>[Incarnation, 'Kang Ilhun', has spent 300 coins.]
<!>[Incarnation, 'Kang Ilhun', has taken over the 'Command Controller'.]
A small controller appeared in Killer King's hand. As he entered the command in a flamboyant manner, a bright red aura exploded from Literature Girl 64's entire body.
Using her explosive power, she approached Tyranno's hind legs, and she stretched out her fist, which was raised strongly.
Bang!
With a roar, Tyranno's ankles staggered.
3 consecutive hits.
The enraged Tyranno cried out and swung its huge tail.
His sister exclaimed.
"Parring!"
"I get it."
When Killer King operated the controller, Literature Girl 64 crossed her arms and radiated magical energy at just the right time.
Tyranno's tail bounced off as if it had hit an invisible barrier.
It was a truly phenomenal level of connection.
I never thought I'd see that skill that only applies in games being actually reproduced.
<!>[You have activated 4 Intermediate Commands in a row!]
<!>[Penalties for 'Battle Action Mode' are activated!]
<!>[Command input will be suspended for 30 seconds.]
"Yerin!"
"Don't worry."
The Tyranno, who had trodden its foot, stamped it into the ground at random. Literature Girl 64 jumped up the tree.
It wasn't a clean move like before, but an appropriate maneuver using innate physicality.
As the trees in the area were to be uprooted, Literature Girl 64, guessing, went around Tyranno.
"It's okay. Now!"
<!>[The penalty for 'Battle Action Mode' is lifted!]
Literary Girl 64, who caught the timing, got on the Tyranno's tail and started to run.
A strange smile crept onto Killer King's mouth as he operated the controller.
"Vision yes. Dark Spinning Breaker."
Literature girl 64's claw spinning like a top in the air is a dark red color.
She ripped out both of Tyrannosaurus' eyes as it turned back, then thrust the claw through the center of its skull.
With a thump, Tyranno's floor bones shattered and its blood spurted out.
<!>[Successfully activated advanced command!]
<!>[The battle action mode is canceled.]
<!>[General Review: 91 points for linkage! Are you aspiring to be a pro gamer?]
The aura disappeared from Literature Girl 64's body.
With a sigh, she trudged down from Tyranno's gigantic body. A slight tiredness was felt in her gait.
"What is the linkage score?"
"91 points. Too bad."
"It's better than before."
"I still have enough coins left to play a few more times."
"What is that?"
"What do you mean?"
"You gave my technique a strange name."
"I don't remember."
Through that one fight, I got to know the fighting styles of the two.
<!>[Battle Action Mode is literally a skill that allows you to manipulate your strengthened body as if you were playing a fighting action game.]
When Literary Girl 64 activates her skill and passes the controller to Killer King, Killer King activates her skill by inputting a command.
It was a simple, but never easy connection.
A combat method that creates explosive synergies in an instant, with one person focusing on strengthening the body and the other focusing only on the movement of the body.
It was a battle method that was possible because they were two people who fully believed in each other.
Killer King said, perhaps conscious of my gaze.
"You seem surprised by the control of this body."
"Your sister is really amazing."
"If you've seen it to your heart's content, take out the secret weapon you've been hiding."
We continued running through the forest.
There was less than a hundred meters to the research building.
Oh oh oh!
Perhaps because of the influence of the black moon, the speed of the monsters chasing us is getting faster.
There were at least twenty hordes of raptors approaching from either side. There were over ten guys blocking the front.
The Killer King frowned and said.
"Yerin, what is the cooldown time?"
"There are still three minutes left."
Apparently, there is a cooldown for [Battle Action Mode].
I said, speeding up my steps.
"I'll try it this time."
I took a deep breath
<!>[Incite with the “last dragon of the Apocalypse” earlier failed.]
Maybe it's because I'm not good enough. So, is the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon possible? I don't know.
Anyway, “Tyranno” was a success.
Then.
"I am."
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.6', is activated!]
"I am the Snake That Cut Off Its Tail."
Tsutsutsutsutsutsutsu!
As expected, there seems to be a penalty for [Inciting] as someone with a higher rank than me. Pain surged through the blood vessels throughout my body, as if electricity were flowing instead of blood, and my consciousness flickered for a moment.
<!>[The constellation, 'Snake That Cut Off Its Tail', looks at you with astonished eyes.]
Still, it was probably because his level was low, and I was able to withstand this level of aftermath.
I swallowed the rising blood. I thought I could say at least one word.
"Go away!"
All the raptors in front of me were frightened by my cry and ran away.
<!>['Incite', is canceled.]
My whole body trembled as if I had been electrocuted with the sound of Tsutsutsutsu and Killer King supported me as I stumbled and vomited.
"I didn’t know [Incite] could be used like this."
"Cheon Inho is more of a fraud than I thought."
We jumped right into the central research building. Fortunately, the 6th-level Earth Dragon hadn't moved yet, but there was a problem.
Upon entering, the central research building was divided into A and B.
"We need to secure an ampoule. You know."
I nodded.
The rewards you can get from this movie are various 'ability ampoules'.
Killer King moved to building B and said to us.
"You go to Building A with Yerin. I'll be in charge of Building B."
"Will you be okay by yourself?"
"Don’t care."
Maybe because I'm carrying Jeong Heewon on my back, a proper battle is impossible.
This time, I didn't hesitate to be considerate. I couldn't afford to think about that.
I searched Building A with Literature Girl 64, and found the place I was looking for within a few minutes.
<!>[Embryology Lab.]
We immediately opened the door and entered.
Looking at the flasks and ampoules scattered throughout the laboratory, it seemed that we had come to the right place.
In a transparent incubator, a baby dinosaur was seen as an embryo.
While I was looking at the scene inadvertently, Literature Girl 64 approached me.
"They'll never be born."
Words that I don't know whether they're questions or self-talk.
I answered at random.
"I guess so."
This hidden scenario is just a virtual stage. The moment the movie ends, everything will disappear. The same would be true for these embryonic dinosaurs.
Literature Girl 64 said in a nonchalant voice.
"Maybe it's better not to be born."
Looking back at her absentmindedly, Literary Girl 64 lowered her head as if avoiding my gaze.
According to my recollection, she had never read the entire book. It was only said that her brother, Killer King, had told her over and over again.
How does she feel about being drawn into this world?
"Is this it?"
"Yes, that's right."
When reading, we quickly found the ability ampoules that appeared in the main story.
Comprehensive stat ampoules that increase strength, stamina, sensitivity, and horsepower, respectively.
The total number of ampoules found was twenty-four.
We split the ability ampoules in half each. I decided to take the special ampoule I found additionally.
Tyrant T-Rex's DNA Ampoule.
An item that increases all stats by 10 for 30 minutes when consumed.
Considering the last floor of the theater dungeon, this ampoule was a must.
Koo-goo-goo-goo!
The whole building shook precariously as if it had been hit by an artillery shell.
"Let’s go straight to the roof."
Outside the window, I saw a huge earth dragon getting up.
The research buildings are connected to each other
If he has heard the commotion, the Killer King is probably coming up on the roof.
The 6th-grade Ji Yong-jong, the master of the Cretaceous period, roars!
<!>[All living things in the area fall into 'predation fear'!]
The roar that roared through the entire building made me feel like my spine froze for an instant.
I quickly activated the skill.
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.6', is activated.]
"There is no need to be afraid."
Literary Girl 64, who had been frozen for a while, came back to her senses and climbed the stairs.
After a roar, the Earth Dragon swung its front paws around as if searching for its prey. All the windows in Building B were destroyed, and the building began to collapse from the corner. It was the same research building where Killer King entered.
Literature Girl 64 opened her mouth.
"My brother is strong."
I know. Killer King is clearly an excellent incarnation.
However, his areas of excellence were resourcefulness and fighting, not overall ability or physical abilities.
Above all, the character he possessed was Kang Ilhun, the vice president of the Dongdaemun Group.
No matter how much Jophiel acquired as a sponsor, the probability of surviving that collapse site considering the potential of his incarnation is-
"You are late."
The roof door burst open, revealing Killer King.
"Ampoules?"
"I got it."
When his sister answered, Killer King nodded.
"Leave right away."
The Earth Dragon, who had spotted us, was gathering his breath towards us.
<!>[The owner of the 6th level Jiryonggun, the Cretaceous, prepares the Cretaceous Silk!]
It seems to use something similar to a breath that is a 6th grade earth dragon.
Fortunately, an escape helicopter had arrived on the roof of the research building.
"Get on!"
After Literature Girl 64 got on first, she accepted Jung Heewon, who was away from me. Jung Heewon seemed to take quite a while to wake up. As it was, there was no problem in escaping.
However.
<!>[This helicopter is limited to 3 people.]
<!>[A new helicopter will be created in 10 minutes.]
The noise of the helicopters deafened my ears.
I could see Literature Girl 64 shouting something.
There was no way this was it.
In the main story, it was clear that four people could board the helicopter.
<!>[The 'Theater Owner' is satisfied with the ending condition change.]
The scenario has changed.
Maybe it's because the maximum number of people in a “team” is three.
Only up to three people can escape at once.
<!>[The constellation, 'Snake Cutting off its Tail', protests!]
<!>[The constellation, 'Snake Cutting off its Tail', claims an end to annihilation.]
<!>[The 'Theater Owner' ignores the constellation's claim.]
<!>[The 'Theater Owner' wonders who the final victim will be.]
I looked back at Killer King. He happened to be talking to his sister.
<&>「If it’s these two.」
If Jung Heewon were added to the teamwork the two showed, wouldn't it be possible to prevent a showdown on the rooftop?
I took a step back from my blood and thought.
Ahhh, the chopper is coming again. You only need to buy 10 minutes while running away somehow. If I use [Incite] to the maximum–
"You ride it."
Turning around, Killer King was talking with his back turned.
Is it a hallucination created by an urgent situation?
It felt as if Yoo Joonghyuk was standing there.
I shook my head and stood next to him.
"I'll stay. You ride there."
The master of the Cretaceous Period's lungs swelled greatly. Its breath will pour out soon.
I'm ready to use [Incite].
Even if I overdo it, let's become the Snake That Cut Off Its Tail one more time. Then I might be able to pick up the direction of its breath a little bit.
"It's a 6th-level earth dragon. It's not an opponent you can do anything about with [incite].
"You have to do that to know."
"I know even if I don't try. I've read the Revelation 100 times."
"Wasn't it 99.8 times?"
"I reread what I knew in my head."
You don’t usually say you've read that?
Killer King asked without giving me a chance to tackle.
"How many times have you read it?"
"I–"
“You must have read it over 100 times. I can tell. But."
After saying that, Killer King put on the black half-glove he took out from his chest.
"I read it more diligently."
As he took a step forward, an unusual spark flew from his body.
<!>[The constellation, 'Commander of the Red Cosmos', praises the courage of his incarnation.]
<!>[The constellation, 'Commander of the Red Cosmos', bestows blessings on his incarnation.]
"I read it ten times, a hundred times harder than you."
There was no agitation in Killer King. Even so, at that moment. For some reason, I felt persuaded by Killer King’s words.
With those words, Killer King ran towards the “Owner of the Cretaceous Period.”
In an instant, I remembered ORV.
His sponsor is “Commander of the Red Cosmos,” Jophiel.
I remembered the way Jophiel fought in the 1863rd round.
<&>「The whole sky howled in agony. At first glance, it was red fog, but if you look closely, each one was a large army of small soldiers. Unit 503 of <Eden> dyed the sky red.」
A bloody elite soldier who follows the “Commander of the Red Cosmos.”
The red mist that was now dwelling all over Killer King was neither as thick nor as wide as the one in the 1863rd round.
Just enough fog to barely protect one person.
Quadddeed!
The breath of the dinosaur from the Cretaceous period colliding with the red mist was dispersing.
"Get on! We don’t have time!"
When I turned around, Killer King's sister was holding me by the sleeve.
Without hesitating any longer, I boarded the helicopter.
The helicopter slowly rose from the ground. Killer King's appearance quickly began to recede.
The furious Earth Dragon raced towards Killer King. Unfortunately, Killer King's red fog had already disappeared. The monster's paws lightly grabbed Killer King's helplessly exposed body.
As I was about to stand up from my seat, Killer King's sister grabbed me.
"My brother is strong."
Two people had faith. The faith of a person who has read a certain novel a hundred times, and the faith of a person who has spent that time together.
<&>「A reader who has read a story a hundred times might be able to find even the lost sentences of the writer who wrote the story.」
Looking closely, the item held in Killer King's right hand emitted a faint light.
I immediately realized what the item was.
<&>「Petrified Dongja.」
Killer King safely got one of the hidden pieces that I wrote down on a note in the box.
<&>「A disposable item that becomes “stone statue” for 4 hours after use.」
<!>[Stone Statue status is not easily canceled unless it is hit by at least a constellation level being.]
If it was that item, it would surely be able to survive an attack from a 6th-level earth dragon.
I could see Killer King's body hardening into solid stone.
<!>['Ending credit' reached.]
<!>[Actors: Cheon Inho, Lee Seyeon, Jung Heewon.]
<!>[You obtained 500 coins each as an appearance fee.]
The 2nd Apostle of the 7 Apostles, Killer King.
The man who still believed that this story was not over was looking up.
Waving his stiff hand, he seemed to be signaling something.
I couldn't figure out what he meant, but his sister listened to him.
"I’m curious about the next part."
Those were his words.
