<title>709 Episode 26 Star Ladder (5)
As the chatter of <Asgard> subsided, the sky over Ginnungagap was covered in silence again.
A sky where no star dares to shine.
It was not simply because the veil of 'Ginnungagap' hid the starlight. Beyond that veil, there was a being that caught the light of all the stars.
Kim Dokja burst into laughter under his breath.
"Look, you can’t do that."
The great constellations remained silent, unable to respond to those words.
They probably felt it too.
Just now, a constellation from <Asgard> fell from beyond the sky of 'Ginnungagap'. I don't know what the constellation's modifier or true name is. However, judging from the reactions of the great constellations, it seems that he is not a weak guy.
That constellation fell all at once.
'Is Yoo Joonghyuk over there?'
Kim Dokja looked up at the sky without answering.
What Kim Dokja can see, I can also see. However, Yoo Joonghyuk was not visible in Kim Dokja's eyes. All that was reflected in my eyes was a landscape that looked like a pitch-black blackout curtain.
—There is.
Still, we could imagine.
The fragments recovered by Kim Dokja were talking to us.
<&>「"Kim Dokja. Are you there?"」
It was a voice from the distant past.
Words that his colleagues once searched for him with.
<&>「"Dokja-ssi."」
<&>「"Ahjussi! Can you hear me? Ahjussi!"」
Since this world line did not allow communication with them, their voices were nothing more than auditory hallucinations created by Kim Dokja's memories.
Still, we knew. Even if the voice is different, even if the pitch and content of the words are different, <Kim Dokja Company> is looking for Kim Dokja beyond the stage.
Because this is 'that kind of story'.
—In the end, all that remains is the story.
This story is all about Kim Dokja.
'Do you miss them?'
The agitation felt like a faint ripple and then subsided.
—I told you. That's not my responsibility.
Suddenly my emotions soared.
I wanted to tell the Demon King of Salvation.
You don't have to be that kind of person. There is no reason why you have to be the only 'Kim Dokja' like that.
But on the other hand, I understood what he was saying.
His story was telling.
<&>「This is the way of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.」
He can only say that. From the time he was born, he had no choice but to live like that.
Just like that stubborn Yoo Joonghyuk.
At that moment, this thought occurred to me.
If every 'Kim Dokja' had his own role. If you live a story appropriate for that role.
So what is my role as 'Kim Dokja'?
<!>['Kim Nonggaf' will be lifted soon.]
The pitch-black sky was shaking.
The first thing that came to me was relief that I had survived.
When this 'stage' is lifted, the constellations will no longer be able to harm us.
Even if it was a scenario where the scale of probability was at play, even if the opponent was <Asgard>, one of the three powers of the 'Nebula', there was no way they could have suffered a bigger loss than this.
However, the great constellations showed no sign of giving up yet.
<!>[Don’t bluff. No great being can cross that veil now.]
Valkyrie's daughter was right.
In order for the Yoo Joonghyuk I know to descend here, at least a mythical constellation would have to appear and balance the scales.
But there is no way that 'Odin' would appear here just to catch us.
"That means the constellations can’t come to help you."
<!>[There is no need for help from other constellations. Because we alone are enough to hunt you down.]
"The three of them were torn apart earlier."
At those words, a bright roar flowed from 'Valkyrie's Daughter', who inherited the status of the seven great constellations.
<!>[I know what the 'old you' looked like.]
The old Kim Dokja?
<!>[I have seen it several times in the stories of the mythical constellations that hunted you. It was so fascinating that I couldn't help but watch it over and over again. In that story, you were truly beautiful.]
I was wondering.
Is Kim Dokja's true identity really as they claim?
Even if it remains as a 'story', there is no guarantee that the incident was true.
In some stories, the facts are contaminated by false propaganda.
'Valkyrie’s Daughter' continued speaking in a cold voice.
<!>[You are imitating God well despite the skin that God has shed.]
Those words struck my heart in a strange way.
"Imitate."
The Demon King of Salvation laughed without denying those words in any way.
The air around us began to vibrate. Seven constellations, led by 'Valkyrie's Daughter', were approaching with all their might.
'Ginnungagap' is not over yet.
'What are you going to do?'
Three constellations have already left. The remaining great constellations will now risk their life to attack.
'If I use that skill one more time—'
—Then you’ll die.
I know. But there is no other way.
—There is a way.
'Valkyrie's Daughter' flew into the air and threw out a spear, spewing out chills. A fierce gust of wind struck my waist as if the space around me was being compressed.
It's enormous.
Even if it is not a mythical-grade attack, if it is an attack of this level, one hit will kill me instantly.
Even in that situation, Kim Dokja was still smirking.
"Seven of you attack someone with nothing but fault? If we do this, we’ll have no choice but to call our side."
<!>[There is no one on your side here—]
Kim Dokja put his hand into his chest and threw something toward the front.
Acrid smoke spread out with a small explosion sound.
'Poison bomb.'
It was a trophy obtained when dealing with the Misreading association guys in the Star Labyrinth.
Naturally, it was an item that would not cause any harm to the constellations.
<!>[With just this insignificant skill!]
"Miscellaneous skill?"
The constellations, startled by Kim Dokja's words, stopped for a moment.
Then, instead of running straight this way, they started creating wind pressure to blow away the smoke from the poisonous bomb.
They suspected that Kim Dokja might have set a trap.
But that was exactly the effect Kim Dokja was aiming for.
"Anna Croft."
Anna Croft, who was standing in the back, trembled at Kim Dokja's call.
Kim Dokja said, reaching out his hand toward her.
"Heart."
The processing of the 'Lesser Dragon’s Heart' that I requested earlier has just been completed.
Valkyrie's daughter, who witnessed the scene, warned.
<!>[Prophet! What are you trying to do now!]
Anna Croft's movements stopped at the bloody voice.
<!>[I'm sure you're not trying to betray <Asgard>.]
At those words, both Anna Croft, Selena Kim, and Christina Page who were by her side turned pale.
<!>[Have you forgotten whose incarnation you are?]
The reason 'Zarathustra' was able to become as strong as it is now is because of the support of the nebula <Asgard>.
Helping me in a situation where I and <Asgard> were at a loss was tantamount to betraying the Nebula behind her.
Anna Croft's 'Eye of the Great Evil' was seen turning red for a moment.
Tsutsutsu.
Anna Croft stumbled, frowning as sparks flew through the air.
She attempted to read the future with [Future Sight]. Judging by the expression on his face, [Future Sight] probably failed.
Anna Croft, who looked at us for a moment, lowered her head and said.
"I am definitely the incarnation of <Asgard>."
I understood.
In the seventh scenario, it was obvious what the price would be for betraying the third-tier giant Nebula.
If she helps us now, Anna's group will be defeated. So her judgment now was extremely reasonable.
"But."
Anna Croft slowly raised her head, looked at 'Valkyrie's Daughter' and continued her words.
"I’m not sure if you can represent <Asgard>."
The moment I looked into Anna Croft's eyes, I slowly got goosebumps.
I forgot for a moment.
That she is a 'gambler in Las Vegas'.
<!>[What are you saying now?]
"This stage is from the beginning, 'Ginnungagap', what happened here is not recorded. Since it is not handed down, no one outside can know what happened here."
Anna Croft has just placed a bet.
"If you all die here, who will remember what I did?"
<!>[What nonsense are you talking about, prophet!]
A gamble with little chance.
A situation in which a normal 'Anna Croft' would never have intervened.
And yet now, Anna Croft has placed her entire stake on the conman she hates the most.
"Cheon Inho. Can you do it?"
I don’t know if Cheon Inho can do it or not. However, it was not Cheon Inho who was answering now.
"It is possible."
The constellations realized something was wrong and shouted.
<!>[Attack!]
In the meantime, we received the 'Refined Lesser Dragon Heart' from Anna Croft.
I wanted to ask her.
Why did you decide to help us?
In a situation where there is no future in sight, what on earth did you believe and bet on us?
"In no round was I recognized as a 'companion' by the Supreme King."
Anna Croft's gaze was focused on the fallen Yoo Joonghyuk.
"If such a powerful king recognized you as a comrade, there must be a good reason."
Anna Croft had a feeling that this round was the end of the world lines. Therefore, she may also have taken her last gamble.
"Joonghyuk has an eye for people."
The constellations that cleared away the poisonous fog each fired their weapons.
The one that flew first was again the spear fired by 'Valkyrie’s Daughter'.
The thunderous strike contained in the weapon flew over, turning the entire floor over.
<!>[Kill! Recover the fragments!]
Kim Dokja dodged the spear  and immediately swallowed the 'lesser dragon’s heart'.
<!>[Use 'Refined Lesser Dragon’s Heart'.]
My heart was beating loudly and my body was shaking violently. The magical power emanating from the dragon's heart was merging with my heart. Like the fable of a chrysalis becoming a butterfly, I felt my body breaking through its limits.
<!>[Your body evolves!]
<!>[The story of the 'Braqui Clan' dwells in your heart.]
But the opponents were constellations.
It was not possible to overcome the defense just by absorbing a single 'lesser dragon's heart' and increasing the amount of magical power.
The weapon that had passed us was flying back to us across the distant sky.
Considering that the range of the lightning discharged was larger than before, it seemed difficult to avoid it by fluke.
This time we have to hit with all our might.
—Youngest.
'Yes.'
The moment my heart beat loudly, the dragon's heart carried rough magical energy throughout my body.
As I felt pain due to torn blood vessels, pages started turning in my head.
<!>[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]
We are Kim Dokja.
Readers fight in their own way.
—The person we need right now.
'It's a monster that can take on seven great-grade constellations.'
—It’s hard to do just that. The physical size doesn't match, so the cost of class is too high.
'It won't work even with a broken sword.'
A character who can defeat seven great constellations.
There were many people that came to mind, but it was hard to think of anyone who could take them down without unduly harming the balance of the scales.
—There is one.
But will it work? That person is a 'constellation'.
Originally, [Bookmark] only works on 'characters'.
In fact, in the Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint, Kim Dokja never once borrowed the power of 'constellations' as a bookmark.
—Maybe, because I happened to get the 'Dragon Heart' too.
But it wasn't impossible.
There was definitely an increase in understanding of bookmarks for 'constellations'.
'Then let's do it.'
An existence that is at the limit that my current body can handle and that the probability of the scale allows.
<&>「"This guy was born to be a businessman."」
As the pages stopped turning, his history filled my ears.
<&>「"I was born with the blood of a dragon."」
In the main story, there was no opportunity to borrow his power as a 'bookmark'.
This is because there was insufficient understanding.
<!>[You possess the 'Dragon Heart'.]
<!>[Your body specifications are similar to the person's body specifications.]
But what about now?
<!>[Bookmark number 21 is activated.]
My heart was pounding loudly and my vision was distorted.
The rushing constellations shouted as if they were struggling.
<!>[I don’t know what you’re trying to do—]
<!>[Kill him! At best, he can only use the power of a great-grade!]
At best, he is a great-grade.
However, even great-grade have a hierarchy.
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Three Swords Lv. ???' is activated!]
He is the most powerful constellation.
He is a being who has never swung his sword at the same opponent more than three times in his life.
A warrior who cut down a thousand people with one sword, collapsed a mountain with two swords, and split the sea with three swords.
<!>[Bookmark number 21 'Goryeo First Sword Cheok Jungyeong' is activated!]
The constellation at the rear, who belatedly realized something, shouted.
<!>[Wait, stop! Valkyrie's daughter! Something is wrong! Now he is—]
Before he could even finish his words, the entire landscape in front of him was torn apart.
