<title>970 Episode 58 Mythical Constellation (2)
I've heard countless nonsense from <Olympus>, but this was a first.
<!>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', scoffs.]
Using the story of the 'Demon King of Salvation', you want to honor me, who killed one of the twelve gods of <Olympus, as a being equivalent to a 'mythical constellation'? That <Olympus>?
<!>[I think I understand what you're thinking.]
"Aha, you've probably looked back on your own history, haven't you?"
Instead of answering, Ares slowly turned his head and gazed at the scenery of the 'Valhalla Hall'.
Beyond the screen, the constellations in the hall were causing a ruckus. Most of them were those who had bet coins in the Golden Dice Hall. They were screaming, wailing, using force, and being dragged away.
But not everyone was in such turmoil. Some constellations, meanwhile, were contemplating sub-scenarios. To acquire new incarnations, or to find new stories to immerse themselves in, forgetting their 'Valhalla Halls'.
<@>[How do they appear to you?]
I paused, beginning to speak.
<!>[The story 'Demon King of Salvation', gazes at the landscape of the 'Valhalla Hall'.]
I felt the story within me staring at the constellations.
Surely, I—Kim Dokja—hated them. But even that hatred, in this world, was merely fuel for the story.
<@>[You must know by now. There are things you can't help but see once you reach the 85th scenario.]
I vaguely understood Ares's meaning. It was the same feeling I had when I watched the executioner with Anna Croft.
<@>[The stars are here because they love stories.]
I couldn't deny those words. Yet, the reason I couldn't help but speak was perhaps because there was still a part of me that believed I was 'human'.
"What you did is unforgivable."
<!>[…]
"Do you think the history of slaughtering and humiliating the incarnations can be justified with such romantic reasons?"
<!>[I have no intention of justifying it.]
Ares said this and looked down at Valhalla Hall again.
A constellation, being dragged away for failing to repay a debt to the Golden Dice Hall, was raging. Watching the constellation finally subdued and suffering a miserable death, Ares spoke.
<!>[That person's modifier is 'God of Peace and Relief'.]
Honestly, he seemed more suited to being called 'God of Wrath and Gambling' than 'God of Peace and Relief.'
<@>[He stayed in this 'Valhalla Hall' and helped many incarnations in lower-level scenarios. Many incarnations in North America survived thanks to his good deeds.]
It was an unbelievable story. To me, the 'God of Peace and Relief' looked like a crazy old man going crazy over a gambling debt.
Ares spoke again.
<!>[The star speaking next to him is the 'Caregiver of Light and Compassion'.]
The constellation Ares pointed to was a gentleman speaking to the 'God of Peace and Relief' being dragged away. The gentleman on the screen—the 'Caregiver of Light and Compassion'—was constantly speaking to the dragged constellations.
<@>[He must be contracting to take in the incarnations of the constellations being dragged away.]
Honestly, I was a little surprised. Taking in the incarnations of fallen constellations?
<!>[He's taking in and nurturing abandoned incarnations like that. But the higher-ranking constellations in the Great Nebula know what that star is really doing.]
On the screen, the 'Caregiver of Light and Compassion', having received a haggard incarnation, wore a kind smile.
<@>[All the incarnations he takes in are used as low-level mercenaries on the 'main battlefield'. They become what's called a 'meat shield'.]
"..."
<@>[And among the incarnations collected, those that seem completely unpromising are sent off as ingredients for banquets like the 'Gourmet Association'.]
"Then that deal—"
<@>[Yes. It's a form of human trafficking.]
I wanted to go and stop the deal right away. But Ares, seeing my expression, shook his head.
<!>[Even if you leave, nothing will change.]
"Still, isn't it better than staying still?"
<!>[You're not even a constellation. Stopping them won't solve the fundamental problem. Are you going to collect the abandoned incarnations?]
Hearing Ares' words, I felt a strange sense of déjà vu. Why was I seeing another constellation as I looked at his expression right now?
<!>[Even if those incarnations remain in this 'Valhalla Hall', there's no future for them. It would be better to wish them the blessing of the story. If they're lucky, they might be able to find a new sponsor in the 'Main Battlefield'.]
Then the screen changed again. This time, the person appearing on the main screen was a constellation I also knew.
Ares smiled dryly, perhaps already aware of this fact.
<!>[You must be familiar with that constellation.]
He was the 'Bald General of Justice'.
A constellation that had been Kim Dokja's longtime supporter and had fought alongside him in the 'Demon King Selection Tournament'.
<!>[What does that constellation look like to you?]
"…"
<@>[That constellation treated you very well, didn't it? Then, would that constellation be considered a good constellation?]
That's right. If there's such a thing as a 'good constellation', it would undoubtedly refer to Samyeongdaesa. Nevertheless, I couldn't quite open my mouth. After all, Samyeongdaesa also observed the lives of the incarnations.
Countless incarnations came and went for his 100 coins. Countless comedies and tragedies must have unfolded before his eyes. He must have felt joy and sorrow reading those stories.
On the screen, Samyeongdaesa gazed upward with blank eyes. The symbol of the shining golden Hall of Dice. D-Coins were falling towards him, radiating a bright beam of light. Perhaps he, too, had bet on this bet.
<!>[That constellation has poured out all its stories over the years for the Prophet who caused the death of his incarnation.]
Samyeongdaesa gazed blankly at the D-Coins falling over his head, then at the empty scaffold.
What words were etched in his mind right now? Was he rejoicing at winning the bet, or lamenting his inability to feel joy even in this situation?
Finally, it was Ares who spoke for me.
<!>[This universe is too dark to read. That's why beings who have become stars must burn themselves to create light. But when you burn yourself to read the stories, there are times when you gradually lose track of what's going on.]
"…"
<!>[Things you once held dear disappear somewhere, and only miscellaneous stories that have crept in from somewhere occupy your mind.]
I turned to face Ares, who spoke without answering.
At that moment, he wasn't the 'Ferocious God of War' I knew. He seemed like the 'Mass-Production Maker', or the 'Queen of the Darkest Spring'.
<@>[And yet, all we can do is read a single line of stories over and over again. That's the tragedy of the damned star born into this <Star Stream>.]
It was truly strange, but he also seemed like Kim Dokja.
"The 'Ferocious God of War' I knew didn't speak like you."
He was the god of war. One of the twelve Olympian gods, who would use any means necessary for victory. Sometimes petty, often tenacious. And strong.
"Are you reborn too? Or do you have amnesia?"
<!>[In the sense that they must burn themselves to read stories, all stars are like amnesiacs.]
"When you burn something, it leaves a mark."
I glared at him and continued.
"No matter how many famous stories you've read or how great your achievements, the marks of the burn will never disappear. They will eventually grow like soot. Records never disappear."
Ares, instead of denying my words, simply looked at me with a pitying look.
<!>[You're right. But if you continue to be haunted by those marks, you won't survive the next scenario.]
"I don't think that's something I should hear from a mere narrative-grade."
Ares's expression changed at the mention of narrative-grade.
<!>[Yes. You're now a 'mythical' one.]
For a moment, a myriad of emotions flashed across Ares's face. He licked his lips, seemingly hesitant, before finally asking me.
<!>[What kind of scenery do you see in your world?]
I wonder if the constellations who have stayed as narrative-grade for a long time are still curious about the world of the myth-grade.
Ares hesitated and continued to ask, as if he had heard something from somewhere.
<!>[Is there a Round Table scenery, as rumored? Or is there a completely different cosmic landscape?]
Perhaps that desire is what has driven Ares, the 'Ferocious God of War', to live on.
"Even if I explain, you won't understand."
I had made up a story because I didn't want to say anything, but Ares nodded in response.
<@>[I suppose so. He said the same thing.]
He?
<@>[Anyway, I think you should carefully consider the alliance proposal. Even if you've reached mythic status, there are monsters in Ragnarok that even the myth-grade constellations fear. <Olympus> has been your enemy until now, but now it could become your ally.]
"Why are you so desperate to recruit me? Why are you suddenly bending your pride? Don't you possess many myth-grade constellations?"
Ares remained silent for a moment, observing the Valhalla Hall before muttering softly with an inscrutable expression.
<!>[We simply want to see the next story.]
When I turned my head, Ares's incarnation body had vanished. For me, who had expected a fierce battle, it was a somewhat disappointing ending.
So, did <Olympus> change its mind in order to recruit me?
While it felt real that I had indeed attained mythic status, I also felt somewhat complicated about this new aspect of Ares. Next to enter the reception room was the narrative-grade constellation of 'Papyrus'. As soon as he entered, he declared to me in an overbearing manner, as if ordering me.
<@>[Demon King of Salvation! Come under the protection of our <Papyrus>! …Huh? Why are you laughing?]
Yes, there must be things that remain unchanging like this.
***
After chasing away the narrative-grade constellation of <Papyrus> with [Incite], the last constellations to come to me were the narrative-grade constellation of <Guardian Tree> and the judge of <The Underworld>.
<@>[The constellation, 'Goddess of the Morning Star', gazes upon you.]
As expected, the leader of the <Tree of Guardians> was the 'Goddess of the Morning Star', Bakarine, who had a connection with Kim Dokja from the 'Gourmet Association'.
On the other hand, the judge from the <Underworld> who accompanied her was a somewhat unexpected guest for me.
"If it were Olympus's offer, I'd already declined."
<!>[I'm not here as a representative of Olympus.]
I know that. The <Underworld> and <Olympus> are clearly distinct groups. Still, just in case, I asked.
"Did the Father of the Rich Night ask you to bring me?"
At this point, the ruler of the <Underworld> was Hades, the 'Father of the Rich Night'.
If I had to choose a single constellation to ally with, I'd feel more comfortable allying with the <Underworld> than <Olympus>. I thought we'd finally meet them in 'Ragnarok', but the Judge said something unexpected.
<!>[He's not currently the ruler of the Underworld.]
Hades doesn't rule the Underworld? Then is it Persephone?
<!>[The current ruler of the Underworld is the 'God of Wine and Ecstasy'.]
Dionysus, the God of Wine and Ecstasy.
Come to think of it, other recorders in the 'Archives' said something similar. Dionysus became independent from Olympus and formed a new power.
Did that mean the Underworld?
<!>[Demon King of Salvation, let's get straight to the point. We want you to join us.]
"If it's us, does that mean the two nebulae are already allied?"
Bakarine and the Judge nodded simultaneously at my question.
I couldn't believe it, but the <Tree of Guardians> and the <Underworld> are allied.
"What on earth is going on up there?"
If those proud nebulae were joining forces, it meant the scenario unfolding on the 'main battlefield' would be too much for even the nebulae to handle.
I wondered if I could hear some relevant information, but Vakarine shook her head with a dark expression.
<@>[I can't tell you that.]
Perhaps there were restrictions on sharing information about higher-level scenarios here.
Perhaps it was because I seemed disappointed, but Vakarine hesitated for a moment before speaking.
<!>[What we can tell you is that you don't have much time to choose. The 'Valhalla Hall' will close soon. Please choose the stars you will join before it's too late.]
After saying that, Vakarine seemed to ponder something, then added with a slight spark:
<@>[Unless you want to become another 'Kim Dokja'.]
