<title>819 Episode 41 Sophistry (3)
—Youngest.
"I will never do that."
I said, looking at the approaching subway lights.
"It's obvious what's going to happen inside, so why would I do that?"
Again, that subway was definitely the train from the 'first scenario'. The train where all the people inside the train were annihilated, the very train where the 「proof of value scenario」 started.
—It could just be a train. If you take that, you'll be able to get there faster.
"It's Bulkwang Station 3434? Have you forgotten that important train number?"
—What kind of person remembers something like that? And aren't you being too nervous?
What happened there was only the 'first scenario'.
Kim Dokja's words made sense.
What happened there was only the 'first scenario'. This is a story from when my body average was 1. And now, I have surpassed 100 in comprehensive ability a long time ago, and I am strong enough to fight even the most great constellations.
"You seem to have forgotten, but this is the 'Terror Spirit'. Do you think that is simply the stage for the first scenario?"
I haven't checked the horror level of that subway yet, but some 'horrors' in this world have strong enough control to control the power of the constellations. The traffic lights that were disaster-level horrors were that strong, so what if that subway is even worse?
What if the first scenario is about to break out inside there, and the suppression power of that scenario is strong enough to crush even me?
—Hmm, youngest.
"I won't ride it."
—No, listen to me.
"I won't ride it."
—That's why I said not to say that...
"I said not to ride it."
—Don't say that! That's the trigger!
"Huh?"
<!>[A 'Nameless Fear' has been unlocked.]
<!>[Catastrophic fear 'Strong Negation is Strong Affirmation' is activated!]
What?
<!>['Strong Negation is Strong Affirmation's effect is realized!]
The moment I blinked, I was already on the subway.
***
rlaehrwk41: Is Yoo Joong-hyuk on board too?
rlaehrwk37: Be quiet
…
<#>【Who just said that?】
***
If I think about it, 「Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint」 is a story that has a deep connection with subway. The first scenario starts in the subway, and the final scenario ends in the subway.
But now that I'm on that subway, the subway background is starting to feel metaphorical.
Maybe all Kim Dokjas are destined to never be able to escape this damn subway line.
Thump.
I looked around while holding onto the subway handle. The inside of the subway was an ordinary scene from the commute home that you can see anywhere. People sitting in the seats, people standing. Everyone was looking down and concentrating on their smartphones as if they had made a promise.
Are those people real or fake?
I don’t know. After entering the state of fear, I can’t really tell what is fantasy and what is reality.
I glanced at those people, then quietly turned my gaze and checked the subway car number.
3807.
As expected, it was 'that car' that Kim Dokja had ridden. Damn it.
—Youngest.
The phone call that had been disconnected for a moment was reconnected.
I asked urgently.
"What the hell was that? Why was I suddenly on the subway—"
The moment I answered, the passengers’ eyes were all focused on me. My hair stood on end, and there was a ringing in my ears. Along with a slight dizziness…
<&>「Stand ing on the sub way」
A strong feeling of nausea…
<&>「Tal king on the phone」
It felt like the world was turning upside down…
<&>「That's rude.」
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' activates!]
I hung up the phone in a hurry, and the gazes that had been looking at me returned to where it was. The dizziness disappeared and my vision returned to its original position.
I took a few deep breaths to calm my startled heart, then selected 'me' from my smartphone contacts and sent a text message.
'Let's talk like this.'
Thankfully, I got a reply.
—Let's do that.
'Please explain the situation briefly. I don't understand what's going on.'
—The story that brought you into the subway is a disaster-level horror that roams the fear spirit. The horror name is 'Strong Negation is Strong Affirmation.'
'This subway is a different horror, right?'
—That's right.
'Why did that horror show up now?'
—You were just unlucky. Well, there's something a little uneasy, but I'll talk about that later.
'No, don't talk about it later.'
—Youngest, since it’s come to this, let’s think positively. What’s a subway? It’s just a means of transportation.
'In this story, the subway is a direct route to the underworld.'
—Don’t think so negatively. Maybe we can get to the place we want faster.
'Please search for related information quickly. Isn’t this subway in the book written by Han Sooyoung?'
Actually, I could search for it and read it, but I couldn’t do it right now. It’s because my stomach was still upset from the aftereffects of the stares I received before.
Fortunately, Kim Dokja seemed to have guessed my condition.
—Wait a minute.
After talking up to that point, I raised my head and saw pitch-black darkness flowing outside the subway window. As I stared at that darkness, the events that would happen in the future came to mind one after another.
<&>「The first scenario began in this subway car.」
Then a question suddenly occurred to me. If all horrors are 'discarded stories', why does this subway exist in this 'terrifying realm'?
Because it has lost its use in the scenario?
Or maybe it's the opposite.
For example, if this train existed here before the 'first scenario'.
My short doubt disappeared along with the vibration of my smartphone.
—Youngest, sit down for now.
It was clear that Kim Dokja was telling me to sit down and calm down.
I was currently standing, holding onto the handrail.
And in front of me were 'two empty seats' waiting for me.
I looked down at those seats and replied.
'No.'
—Why?
'It's suspicious at first glance, so why would I sit there?'
Again, this was the subway on the way home from work. The way home from work.
How could there be two empty seats like that on the way home from work?
Even among the people standing, no one wanted to sit in those seats.
—Then you should sit down more. Then something will start.
So I hope it doesn’t start— I thought to myself, but my body was moving without me realizing it.
Even though my answer was crooked, I also knew that sitting there was the right decision.
No. More precisely,
This would be more 'fun'.
I thought that this is how people gradually become more interested in something, but the moment I sat down, my body magically became comfortable.
'Wow, this.'
I really couldn't express it in words other than the feeling of sitting in an empty seat on the subway on the way home from work.
—I found the related file. I'll put it up for you, so read it.
I immediately started reading the file that Kim Dokja sent me.
+
* Part of this document was modified by SVRP.
SVRP. PW ?
Calamity-level horror— Subway on the way home
+
'Traffic lights' and 'tooth fins'… I thought that the 'PW' that was mentioned in every document was an abbreviation for 'Parallel World'—in other words, 'parallel universe'.
The parallel world line of Ways of Survival is based on the return episode of Yoo Jonghyuk, so if it's PW 041, it would mean the 41st round, and if it's PW 0, it would mean the 0th round.
This time, it's expressed as '?', so it seems that this horror doesn't have a set round.
Anyway, I decided to keep reading.
+
A mysterious train on the way home that often appears throughout the horror zone. It takes the passengers to the 'desired place' in the fear zone.
+
Kim Dokja's guess was right.
It was a 'real means of transportation', right?
But the explanation continued after that.
There's no way an ordinary means of transportation would have this many detailed explanations.
I already don't want to read it.
+
Out of the total 872 recorded statistics, the probability of successfully arriving at the destination using the train was 4.5%.
All passengers who failed to arrive at the destination went missing.
+
I cursed inwardly.
I quickly turned the page.
Yeah, even if only 4.5% survived, they're still alive.
Fortunately, there was a clear record.
+
A normal clear record for the 'fear' was observed in PW 0838.
<!>[Click here!]
+
When I clicked the LCD, a scene flowed out in real time before my eyes. The inside of a burning subway. The screams of people and bloodstains spread here and there.
It reminded me of the first scenario. I heard someone muttering on the screen.
<&>「"You idiots."」
I only heard their voices, but I knew who they were.
Unfortunately, that was the end of the visual aid.
I continued reading.
+
If even one passenger in a certain car is killed, the car is immediately declared a 'crime zone'. The crime zone continues until the last passenger is left.
…
The surviving passengers of the 'crime zone' are summoned to the front car of the train.
The 'crime zone' is declared again in the front car, and continues until the last passenger is left.
The last passenger can communicate with the 'engineer' to get off at the desired area of ​​the terror zone.
PW 0838, the last passenger.
King Yoo Jonghyuk.
+
I knew it.
Since he's 'Yoo Jonghyuk', he could clear the terror in this way.
Let's see. Are there any other records?
+
PW 0912.
Confirmed deaths of all 48 named passengers, including Payhu and Nirobana.
PW 0912 Final passenger.
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint Namgung Minyoung.
+
That disciple is that master.
+
PW 01042 Final passenger.
God of wine and Ecstasy.
+
Wait a minute, the scale is getting bigger, and there's even a round where the 12 gods of Olympus are participating?
+
PW 01284 Final passenger.
Abyssal Black Flame Dragon.
+
A cold sweat ran down the back of my neck.
I heard a loud noise from somewhere and turned around to see a battle already taking place in the front passenger compartment.
A man was annihilating all the passengers in the passenger compartment. The heads of the passengers who rushed in like evil spirits rolled on the floor like toys.
A wide back that reminded me of Yoo Jonghyuk, his disheveled hair, and his familiar sword. I could clearly feel it even through the entrance. That's a constellation.
A powerful constellation at that.
A constellation I know very well.
—Goryeo Swordsman.
'I think it's right.'
Goryeo Swordsman Cheok Jungyeong is on this train.
No, why on earth.
—That guy is always looking for ways to become stronger. This isn't the first time he's been in the terror zone.
Wait.
I thought about asking him for help, but when I thought about it, it was suicide.
Once the 'crime zone' starts, there is only one final survivor on the train.
No matter how kind Goryeo Swordsman is, he would cut my head off at the crucial moment.
Following that, a commotion was heard from the other car along with a loud noise.
It seemed that the 'crime zone' had already broken out in most cars except our car.
Despite the commotion, the passengers in car 3807 were calm. People who calmly buried their heads in their smartphones as if they couldn't hear the commotion.
My mind was getting a little complicated.
Should I also start a 'crime zone' like this?
—Can you win a fight with Goryeo Swordsman?
'I can't win.'
—Then just stay still.
'What if I can't get out?'
—It's better than being killed. And you haven't read much yet. Read the rest.
 It was easy to see why Kim Dokja had told me to keep reading.
+
PW ◼️◼️ and, PW ◼️◼️◼️ additional clear records observed.
It was confirmed that the survivors of the corresponding round did not use the 'Crime Zone'.
+
There is! A record of clearing without using the 'Crime Zone'.
But the records that followed completely betrayed my expectations.
+
<!>[This record has been censored in accordance with the spoiler prevention policy.]
<!>[This record has been censored in accordance with the spoiler prevention policy.]
+
'Are you kidding me?'
—Still, it's not like there was no harvest at this point.
Kim Dokja is right. At least there is a clear way to escape without causing the 'Crime Zone'. Just confirming that is enough.
'Is there a time limit for this horror?'
—There is no such record. It says that on average, trains that once had a 'Crime Zone' would clear all the cars within 30 minutes.
30 minutes.
I asked while organizing my thoughts.
'Isn't there a way you can think of?'
—Well? However… there's something I'm a little curious about.
'It's another one.'
—Why did this train recognize 'Crime Zone' as the correct interpretation?
The moment I was about to answer what that meant, a symbol appeared on the LCD screen, indicating that the communication signal was not being received, with a slight spark.
Why now?
To be honest, I was flustered, but since this wasn't the first time I'd experienced this, I decided to stay calm.
I can't just borrow Kim Dokja's wisdom forever.
The fears of this terror spirit were unfamiliar to Kim Dokja. Neither he nor I knew the answer.
<&>「Why 'Crime Zone' could be the correct interpretation.」
I thought about the hint Kim Dokja left at the end.
All fears have an 'interpretation' that is connected to the way they originated. Just like the traffic lights and the tooth fins.
Then why did this train recognize 'the unsafe zone' as an interpretation?
Is there some kind of probability between the train and violence?
No matter how much I think about it, I can't figure it out.
No matter what conditions related to violence I think of, I don't think they go well with this subway.
If the subway on the way home from work recognized 'the unsafe zone' as an interpretation, there must be a reason for it.
My head is starting to hurt.
It wouldn't have been Kim Dokja, but it would have been nice if there was someone who could help me a little.
Like Yoo Sangah. Wait a minute.
Yoo Sangah?
The moment I thought about that, one of the doors on the train opened and closed. It happened so quickly that I couldn't even think of running towards it.
A new passenger who had just boarded was standing in front of the door. Their eyes were looking around anxiously.
It was a character I knew.
