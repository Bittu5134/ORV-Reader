<title>973 Episode 58 Mythical Constellation (5)
Countless lightning bolts struck the hall. Amidst the raging aftershock of probability, a battlefield several times larger than Mithra had envisioned appeared in the center of the hall.
<!>[There's never been a story like this.]
Mithra, gazing into the void, muttered with a pale face.
<!>[Round Table, are you determined to destroy all my myths...!]
Mithra's roaring expression transformed into that of a demon.
Sentences of probability poured from the sky. They weren't probabilities that could be simply attributed to a scribe interfering with the narrative or a nebula imposing [Fate].
They were, so to speak, the natural order of the cosmos—the <Star Stream>.
<!>[Zeus! Odin! Ra! Nyeowa! Fuxi! Can you truly hear me?]
The myth of Mithra's birth and death defied the natural order of the universe. But the impending odds were too powerful for the old myth to resist.
Mitra's fingertips, pale, began to crumble. He turned to me, as if humiliated.
<!>[Demon King of Salvation, I may not be able to keep my promise to you.]
With those words, Mitra's incarnation body was enveloped in a bright halo of light.
"Wait—"
I reached out to Mitra, then paused. It wasn't just Mitra who was enveloped in the halo. Since when? The surrounding constellations were also engulfed in the halo of light.
<!>[Ah, ah. This is— Light!]
<@>[No! No!]
The constellations of the 'Hall of Golden Dice' were also engulfed in the halo of light, being transported somewhere.
"Kim Dokja."
Even Anna Croft, who was beside me, and Jung Heewon, who was running toward me from afar.
"Dokja-ssi!"
And I, too, was enveloped in a halo of light. Feeling every being in the hall being transported somewhere within the bright beam of light, I realized what was about to happen.
<!>[A 'Giant Battlefield' has been born in 'Valhalla Hall'!]
A distant laughter echoed from somewhere. A strange musical note. A soft whisper, telling of the beginning and end of the world.
<&>「Thus, the long festival of the constellations will finally come to an end.」
Along with the records engraved into the universe of the 'Round Table', the final battlefield of 'Valhalla Hall' was finally opening.
<!>[From now on, all beings in 'Valhalla Hall' will be summoned to the 'Giant Battlefield'!]
***
Back when I was writing web novels, I once asked Kiyeon hyung how to bring characters to life (now that I think about it, I wonder why I asked him of all people).
"You have to write as if you were the character."
That was Kiyeon hyung's advice. Write as if you were one of the characters.
"So, do you always write novels as if you were one of the characters?"
"Yes."
"All your characters speak strangely, don't they?"
"What's wrong with my lines?"
"All your characters laugh, 'Heh heh,' don't they?"
"Because I laugh like that, too."
I thought maybe I'd asked Kiyeon the wrong question, so I asked Ji Eunyu the same question.
Ji Eunyu replied:
"You shouldn't empathize with your characters too much when writing. Then only the writer will find the story entertaining."
"But if you don't empathize at all, won't the characters lose their vividness?"
Ji Eunyu looked puzzled at my question and said,
"Well, ultimately, characters are the writer's alter ego."
"Are you saying I should empathize with them when writing, or not?"
"You should write so that the reader can empathize with them."
"Do you know who your readers are?"
In the end, I couldn't figure out the answer to that question. All I knew was that I knew nothing about my characters or the people who would read my work.
Once I acknowledged that, I lost even a grasp of myself, the writer.
What exactly are characters? Are they something I created, or are they merely borrowing my language and essentially something different from me?
How do I write for people I don't even know?
Who am I, writing an unknown story for people I don't know?
"Ugh."
When I opened my eyes with a slight groan, what unfolded before me was the pitch-black ruins of a Buddhist altar. Pillars of light appeared here and there.
<!>[Ugh, ughhhhhhhh!]
<@>[No! No!]
The screams of the summoned constellations brought me back to my senses.
<&>「We've entered the battlefield.」
A record flashed through my mind. It's helpful to habitually formulate your thoughts in sentences at times like this. Calmly writing down your thoughts and actions, as if you were the character.
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall', activates!]
It wasn't difficult to grasp what had happened. From the moment I entered 'Valhalla Hall', I suspected something like this could happen.
<&>「In the face of the Great Destruction, it was a miracle that a system like 'Valhalla Hall' had lasted this long.」
For the constellations participating in the 'Main Battlefield', the existence of 'Valhalla Hall' was a necessary evil. While it provided a constant supply of elite soldiers, it also meant that the main force, who should have been fighting, was dying there, resulting in a loss of strength.
So, in a way, it was inevitable that this scenario would occur.
However, as Mitra had said, the timing was somewhat premature.
Was such a transfer truly possible solely through the will of the 'Round Table'? The answer to my question quickly surfaced.
<!>[The main scenario has been updated!]
With a tsutsutsu sound, the face of a great dokkaebi appeared in the air.
<!>[I deeply apologize to the constellations who were surprised by this sudden situation.]
I, too, knew that great dokkaebi.
<&>「Great dokkaebi Baram.」
With his appearance, countless constellations' cries pierced the sky.
<!>[What on earth is this!]
<!>[What are we supposed to do, suddenly summoning us to the battlefield?]
<!>[Is this how the Management Bureau manages scenarios these days?]
This wasn't even a low-level scenario, but scenario number 85. It was a late-stage scenario filled with not only great-grade constellations, but even narrative-grade.
That's why the stars' sense of privilege was incomparable to that of the constellations in other scenarios.
<!>[The constellation, 'Impatient Swamp Predator', indignantly points a finger at the Administration Bureau!]
<!>[The constellation, 'Gourmet of the Quiet Isle', laments the Administration Bureau's tyranny!]
<!>[The constellation, 'Master of the White Castle', surveys the battlefield with displeasure.]
The modifier sounded familiar, but they were constellations from the Gourmet Association.
It seemed they, too, were just hanging out here instead of participating in the 'main battlefield'.
<!>[I understand your grievances.]
However, amidst the constellations' outcry, the Great Dokkaebi silently continued his words.
<!>[However, constellations, we cannot continue this festival as you wish forever.]
Baram calmly surveyed the constellations on the battlefield and continued speaking.
<!>[Wait, is it really the 'Valhalla Hall' you all desire in the first place? Is it truly the kind of non-existence you wished for, waiting for the other constellations to clear the main battlefield, holed up there, and exhausting all your remaining starlight?]
For a moment, the constellations' resentment subsided. The Great Dokkaebi's words had struck a chord with them.
<!>[Have you already forgotten the thrill of your first scenario? The memory of obtaining your first item. The days of accumulating your first stories. Gaining allies, killing your arch-enemy, and completing a mission you thought impossible—have you already forgotten those memories?]
The story of the <Star Stream> flowed above the battlefield.
<&>「"You crazy bastard! If you don't kill, you'll die too!"」
<&>「"It doesn't matter."」
Surprisingly, it was my story.
<&>「The first scenario—the scene of 'Proof of Worth'.」
The stars, too, were watching the story. However, the scenery reflected in their eyes was different.
<&>「The stars all see the same story, yet they all think differently.」
Perhaps they are recalling their own 'Proof of Worth'.
They are steeped in their own ancient origins, recalling their own stories, each with its own distinct era, setting, and characters.
<!>[Eventually, all starlight will extinguish, and the universe will return to silence. The moments we enjoyed so much will be recorded in a single line, or nothing at all.]
Like the manager of a failing amusement park, the Great Dokkaebi continued to speak.
<!>[Scenario 85 is a high-level scenario, but it is not the 'end' of the scenario. Burn everything you have to fight. Enjoy the scenario. Pioneer the tale. You are still within the scenario.]
Even without using [Incite], the Great Dokkaebi's speech was deeply moving. However, some emotions only affect those who can sense them.
<!>[Is the Management Bureau calling that speech now!]
The indignant stars roared at the sky, their voices rising.
<!>[Great Dokkaebi! Are you kidding me?]
<!>[Let's all protest! Does this make sense?]
<!>[How much did I pay for my residence fee at 'Valhalla Hall'?]
<!>[Where's the chairman? Let's go find him and confront him! This is ridiculous!]
<!>[Yes, something that should never have happened has happened.]
Looking at them, I thought of the incarnations who had once again united and risen in the 'New Murim District'.
<&>「Some memories have no power.」
To reach Scenario 85, those stars must have accumulated countless stories. They must have lost precious things, overcome sorrow and adversity.
And so, having ascended to this immense height, they were now obsessed with a single story.
<&>「I don't want to fall.」
They didn't want to be eliminated from this scenario. They didn't want to die a pitiful death. Rather than being remembered as a single, great line in history, they wanted to remain as spectators forever, relegated to the back alleys of history.
<!>[Chairman! Where are you, Chairman!]
I understand that sentiment. I have no intention of saying it was wrong.
But they needed to know by now.
<!>[Cancel the scenario immediately! What are those giant nebulae doing?]
The rules of this world they enjoyed must be applied equally to them.

<Main Scenario #85 – The End of Sloth>
Category: Main
Difficulty: ???
Clear Conditions: Survive the 'Super-Large Battlefield' and join the 'Main Battlefield'.
Time Limit: —
Reward: ???
Failure: Death
+
In the commotion of the chaotic stars, I calmly read the content of the scenario.
A massive battlefield. A main event never before held in Valhalla Hall.
The revised main scenario was simple: somehow survive in this battlefield, where the constellations of Valhalla Hall had been summoned.
The challenge was the conditions for 'survival'.
+
—Hunt a 'warrior' stronger than yourself.
+
The first condition wasn't easy.
In other words, intermediate warriors had to hunt advanced-level or higher warriors, and advanced warriors had to hunt special-level or higher warriors.
Of course, that wasn't the only way.
+
—Or hunt five or more warriors of the same rank as yourself.
In essence, an intermediate warrior could clear the scenario by hunting five intermediate warriors.
But even that wasn't easy.
Perhaps to account for the difficulty, there was one final, relatively easy condition.
+
—Hidden 'sanctuaries' would appear on the battlefield at regular intervals.
+
Sanctuaries.
+
—When the Sanctuary appears, a five-minute timer starts. After the timer expires, all twenty participants standing beneath the Sanctuary's light will be transported to the 'Main Battlefield'.
+
In short, simply being near the Sanctuary when the timer expires will clear the scenario.
For the stars, the final condition seems like the only way to clear it worth a try.
<!>[My goodness. We really have to do the scenario?]
Seeing no sign of the scenario changing, one of the constellations, belatedly coming to his senses, muttered.
<@>[No way.]
<!>[Let me out! I'm telling you to let me out!]
Most of them had been through a long time since their last 'scenario'. They had simply enjoyed the incarnations' scenarios, supporting them and sustaining their lives.
For them, risking their lives must have been a strange experience.
<!>[Killing a constellation stronger than me? How could that even make sense...]
Just as if they'd received the first scenario, the constellations were wary of each other, distancing themselves. Some retreated menacingly, while others were already running towards the bushes. On the other hand,
<!>[Ha, is there any constellation that can join us?]
Some cautiously summoned courage.
<!>[We need a team! Let's unite! If we unite, we can overcome this, right?]
The first to summon courage was a high-ranking constellation from the border region.
<!>[If anyone wants to team up— Kaaaaaaak! Wait! What are you doing!]
As if waiting, an arrow flew in and pierced his shoulder.
<@>[Kill him.]
Five or six constellations, swarming from nowhere, attacked the high-ranking constellation like hungry lynxes. In an instant, the great-grade constellation, its limbs severed, was disintegrated into a story before it could even utter a final word.
The constellation, seemingly their leader, bit the dead star's arm and spat it out.
<!>[Intermediate? This won't do. Find at least 'Advanced' or higher.]
I recognized the creature's identity immediately.
<!>[The constellation, 'Black Wolf Reaper', lets out a ferocious howl!]
The Black Wolf Reaper, it was 'Anubis', the narrative-grade constellation from <Papyrus>.
I quickly hid behind cover, avoiding their gaze, and checked my 'warrior rank'.
<!>[You are currently a 'Special Warrior'.]
Special Warrior.
It seemed my value had been elevated by my victory in the previous battle. If I were caught here, I would surely be targeted.
<!>[Run! Papyrus!]
<!>[Those damned giant nebulae—]
As the wolves, led by Anubis, roared, I saw the constellations in the area hurriedly retreat.
I hid behind cover and held my breath until Anubis and the other wolves passed by.
<!>[There was definitely one here, wasn't there?]
Anubis, sniffing around, passed me by, but there was no way he could spot me.
<!>[The story, 'Pebble and I', begins its story!]
Because I was currently in the 'stone' state.
<!>[Hmm, did I read wrong?]
I wasn't particularly afraid of them, but now wasn't my turn to act.
As I waited for Anubis to move away, someone tapped me on the shoulder.
This was impossible. I was currently under the effects of the story, 'Pebble and I'. No one could possibly find me in this state—
No.
There was only one person who could find me in this state.
