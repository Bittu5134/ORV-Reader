<title>612 Episode 12 □□ (3)
In a face-to-face confrontation with Han Sooyoung, there was no chance of winning. The level of proficiency in scenarios, the amount of stories accumulated, and the level of experience as a human being were also different.
<&>「But the sentences in my fingertips were saying.」
It's different here. It's a disadvantage, but it's worth trying here.
As I concentrated, I felt the pulse of the letters floating around.
The sentences written by Han Sooyoung and rewritten by me.
The moment I stretched out my hand into the air, I felt the story wrap around my fingertips.
<&>「Sea Admiral Lee Jihye, smiling widely, was aiming her twin dragon sword at me.」
The moment I held the sentence in my hand, a sword appeared in my hand along with a bright light.
It is the holy relic of the maritime admiral.
Lee Jihye's exclusive weapon, twin dragon swords.
<&>「"Exterminate, twin dragon swords."」
Lee Jihye of the 1,863rd turn finally reached the edge of the scenarios after going through a hellish scenario and going through training in Murim.
<&>「She who survived the 95th scenario is, in name and reality, one of the 100 strongest in Ways of Survival.」
The stories that Lee Jihye had accumulated was wriggling in my mind.
"Lee Jihye."
Han Sooyoung, who was watching the sentence in my hand from afar, said nonchalantly.
"Okay, come on"
I took a step without hesitation.
A bogey against Han Sooyoung does not work.
I immediately activated Lee Jihye's strongest skill in the 1,863rd turn.
<&>「Boneless.」
I became a flash and rushed toward Han Sooyoung.
Quadddeuk!
A violent load was placed on her right arm.
The black flames soared from Han Sooyoung's left hand and struck at the [Boneless] sword strike.
As if it were a real abyssal black flame dragon, the entire floor burned black with the [black flame] she exhaled.
Even though a collision of power of this magnitude occurred in the only beginning of the scenarios, a probability storm was not felt.
"I know what kind of world it is."
As if she had the same thoughts as me, Han Sooyoung smiled.
"Like probability. Is it okay here?"
In the next moment, the brilliance of pure white flames shone from Han Sooyoung's right hand.
<&>「A sword shimmering with white flames appeared in her hand.」
I glared at the sentences wrapped around the white flower sword.
<&>「Before her sword, all the surrounding flames extinguished in homage.」
Cold sweat ran down my back.
It was because I realized what sentence Han Sooyoung was trying to call.
<&>「Infernal flames.」
<&>「Hellfire.」
I hurriedly came up with a new sentence, leaving Yoo Jonghyuk and Jung Heewon behind.
<&>「"Lee Hyunsung doesn’t need a sword. Because that guy is a sword."」
The most important thing in this world was imagination.
The power of a sentence is determined by how high, sharp, and elaborate the intensity of the imagination constituting the sentence is.
<&>「True steel will be born from tens of thousands of hardenings.」
<!>[Steel Sword, the stigma of steel sword emperor Lee Hyunsung flooded around me and covered the entire area.]
However, with my inexperienced imagination, I cannot fully protect Jung Heewon and Yoo Jonghyuk.
In the end, the pouring flame hit Yoo Jonghyuk, who was hardened. The flames of [Hellfire] melted the steel exterior, and I let out a scream because of the heat.
Han Sooyoung's [Hellfire] was much stronger and more severe than the [Steel Sword] I imagined.
When the heat subsided a bit, I caught my breath and looked back at Yoo Jonghyuk, who was covered in flames.
Yoo Jonghyuk was not hurt at all.
The flames of [Hellfire] passed by Yoo Jonghyuk in reality and burned only the armor I created.
As if my reaction was funny, Han Sooyoung said.
"You don't seem to understand the rules of this world."
An understanding came to my mind belatedly.
This is the snowfield, between the lines of the story.
All sentences present here are 'words not yet recorded'.
So until the record is decided, our fight has no effect outside the snowfield.
Han Sooyoung asked me, who sighed.
"Why are you protecting that guy? You don't even know him properly."
"This is Yoo Jonghyuk."
Why do I protect this Yoo Jonghyuk?
"Yoo Jonghyuk was a different person from what you wrote."
Han Sooyoung wrote about Yoo Jonghyuk in the 41st turn and his heartlessness.
However, the Yoo Jonghyuk of the 41st turn I saw was a little different from Han Sooyoung's description.
"Aren’t you also vaguely aware of it? I don't know why, but this Yoo Jonghyuk is not a villain. He is not a man to abandon his comrades."
"I already wrote that, and that's what he will do. Stopping him here will avoid unnecessary sacrifices."
"Are you serious?"
Han Sooyoung answered with a short silence.
"Okay."
"I know who you are."
There comes a moment in everyone's life when you have to defend yourself by saying, "I'm not a bad person."
That's pretty exhausting.
The history of living has become longer, so it is difficult to make excuses for the things that have happened so far, and I think that there is no point in doing it.
I wonder if Han Sooyoung is thinking like that?
"It doesn't matter who I am. It matters what story I write."
I understood Han Sooyoung.
Han Sooyoung is a writer who has thoroughly written stories for only one person.
If she had treated all of her characters as real people, she wouldn't have been able to get to this point.
"If you want to convince me, use that sentence."
I remembered the combat power rankings ranked by readers.
At least those who are far enough to subdue the present Han Sooyoung, the Oldest Dream.
Indescribable Distance .
The Last Dragon of the Apocalypse.
However, it was difficult to precisely specify their strength.
I imagined images and came up with sentences, but the sentences were rarely reproduced.
The same was true of the other deities of the other world, and the strongest among the mythical constellations.
At that moment, I met eyes with Yoo Jonghyuk, who was staring blankly into space.
Eyes filled with the black night sky.
I grabbed the sentence that came to me almost reflexively.
<&>「Ways of Survival: The most righteous and loneliest Constellation of all.」
I could hear the black night on my back.
"The darkness that had been silent for a long time was waking up."
How about a sentence about it?
The stepfather of the DemonKing of Salvation'.
One of Olympus' strongest three gods, if I borrow his power.
<&>「One of the three gods of <Olympus>, 'Father of the rich night'.」
I felt a pitch-black darkness envelop his whole body, and my right hand began to tremble madly.
Even if it was a snowfield where everything was possible, it was a difficult existence to realize with my imagination.
The scythe of Hades descended in my right hand, black as if it had been carved out of the abyss.
Almost at the same time, Han Sooyoung's left hand also wrote a sentence.
<&>「The place his spear touches will soon become the boundary of the sea.」
I felt my ankles get damp, and the snowy floor was filled with waves in an instant.
<!>['Sea God' Poseidon.]
The black night and the vast sea collided.
It felt like the attack was tearing across the horizon, and then the world rotated several times.
When I woke up, I was on my knees on the floor gasping for breath.
"Let’s just end it here. You can’t beat me."
Han Sooyoung was looking down at me.
"I’ll have fun when I go back now. After all, it seems like you don’t deserve it."
Qualification.
"Can you use [avatar]?"
Along with Han Sooyoung's words, countless dolls appeared by her side.
Lee Jihye.
Yoo Sangah.
Lee Hyunsung.
Lee Gilyoung.
Jung Heewon.
Shin Yoosung.
Gong Pildu.
I stared blankly at those faces. Even knowing that all of those dolls were Han Sooyoung's [Avatar]-fakes, I felt like I was going against the whole <Kim Dokja’s Company>.
“If you had obtained the writer’s characteristics, of course you could use it. You don't seem to have them."
I didn't want to admit it.
So, over and over again, I shouted inwardly.
<&>「Avatar.」
However, [Avatar] did not activate.
Why can't I use [Avatar]?
In this world where everything is possible, why isn't that sentence mine?
"It means you're not a 'proper writer'."
I screamed and ran towards Han Sooyoung.
The bullet shot by Gong Pildu pierced my shoulder with a sound of fissit.
<&>「Shooting arrows like rain and shooting various gun barrels, the chaos was like a thunderstorm.」
<&>「"This is why I curse this land, but I can’t leave."」
<&>「Therefore, Taejo is a dot, so the smallest is the greatest.」
Maritime Admiral.
The first sword of Korea.
Kyrgios.
Maritime Admiral and Lee Jihye's Ghost Fleet exchanged artillery fire at the same time. A hazy sea fog obstructed the view from the continuous shelling.
I approached Han Sooyoung in an instant with Kyrios's [All-In-One].
The moment Han Sooyoung's shadow swayed through the fog, Cheok Joon-kyung's [Three Sword Clashes] was activated from her right hand.
<&>「This is a sword made to deal with the sea.」
However, before it could be activated, something grabbed my ankle. It was Yoo Sangah's [Arachne's Web].
Subsequently, Lee Hyunsung’s [Mountain Breaker] slapped my shoulder, and Shin Yoosung's 'Chimera Dragon' breathed at me.
I threw myself into the sea and rolled over several times, vomiting blood.
Is this blood really my blood? Or is this blood even the type of this story?
I heard Han Sooyoung's voice.
"Stop it. It's amazing that you, who aren't even a writer, came this far."
I looked up at her, wiping my mouth with my sleeve.
There was still night law.
There was no valid way to convince her of that either, and I stopped her casually taking my hand towards my pocket. Because I felt cowardly for writing it.
I have my own way.
If I am also a writer, I have to compete with only my own sentences.
"No matter what method you use, it is useless. It's obvious what sentences you're going to write."
Han Sooyoung's eyes were shining brightly.
<&>「Nothing new under the sun. Everything that will be written in the future is a transformation of what has already been written.」
Han Sooyoung's main stigma was finally showing up.
<&>「Predictive Plagiarism.」
There was nothing in this world that Han Sooyoung did not know. Because she actually went through all these sentences, and she wrote them down.
"This world doesn't need a new sentence."
Watching Han Sooyoung approaching step by step, I thought of Kim Dokja.
If I could become that guy, wouldn't I be able to break this situation?
However, the sentence about Kim Dokja never came to mind. If you think about it, even if it worked, it would have been difficult to change the situation because Kim Dokja was not particularly good at fighting.
He really has no way left for me
In this world, isn’t there a sentence that Han Sooyoung doesn’t know about?
"Stop resting."
The moment Han Sooyoung's left hand pointed at me once again, and the gun barrels of Lee Jihye and Gong Pildu moved toward me.
There is. Words she doesn't know.
Like a thunderbolt, a memory was planted in my head.
It took time to put the plan into action.
I caught my breath and opened my mouth.
"… Didn't Kim Dokja come back?"
Han Sooyoung's expression hardened.
She said neither she nor I, but she could tell they were thinking the same sentence.
<&>「The ending of 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』.」
The moment when Kim Dokja's story came back, the system was revived, and Han Sooyoung laughed openly at the hospital’s room door.
In the meantime, I believed that Kim Dokja would return.
It's an open ending, but every sentence in the climax pointed to Kim Dokja's return.
The return of Kim Dokja was in the reader's imagination, out of reach of the author's sentences.
That's why the scene is not described.
That's why I couldn't understand why Han Sooyoung was here right now.
If Kim Dokja had returned safely, there would be no way Han Sooyoung would be here right now.
"That."
Han Sooyoung's lips, which were slowly open, spat out strange words.
"It hasn't been decided yet."
Not decided?
I couldn't understand Han Sooyoung's words.
But at least one goal was achieved.
I bought enough time with this.
"He's—"
With the sound of Tsutsutsutsutsu, Han Sooyoung's whole body was once again engulfed in sparks. And that moment.
<&>「A dark red coat flying in the ruins.」
I grabbed the hidden sentence.
<&>「Black wings protruding through the coat.」
A sentence that even Han Sooyoung, who wrote this whole world, does not know.
This was a story that did not appear in the Ways of Survival she wrote.
<&>「'The one who deceived the stars', and the 'evil sophist'.」
I activated [Incite], recalling the stories of the 40th turn I had seen.
<&>「I am Cheon Inho of the 40th turn.」
Han Sooyoung looked at me with her eyes wide open.
Formidable power welled up in my whole body.
The villain who threatened Yoo Jonghyuk in the 40th turn and drove the stars to ruin.
The unprecedented ten evils who fought the final battle with the main character while holding Yoo Jonghyuk's poisonous weapon: Dark Heaven Demon.
Han Sooyoung sent me a signal as if she felt something out of the ordinary.
Gong Pildu's turret embraced fire, and Lee Jihye's [Ghost Fleet] opened fire. Yoo Sangah's threads twisted the space, and Lee Hyunsung's [Steel Sword] exploded at me.
<&>「[Fable 'When All Stars Close Their Eyes' begins its storytelling.]」
All the stars closed their eyes.
<&>「The main theme is pitch-black darkness. No starlight could illuminate Cheon Inho. No miracle, no light.」
Embarrassed, Han Sooyoung hurriedly looked around.
<&>「It was as if Han Soo-young was alone.」
The moment Han Sooyoung, embarrassed, raised her left hand wildly.
<&>「The Dark Heaven Demon slashed her back.」
With an intense spark, she felt the tip of her sword and came to her senses. The sword made of sentences shattered, and I rolled across the floor in a mess.
It was shallow.
However, there was a sense that it was clearly cut.
When I hurriedly got up from the floor, Han Sooyoung was looking at me with her blank eyes.
"You. What-"
A cracking sound was heard somewhere.
<!>[Giant tale 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' shakes uneasily.]
There were fine scratches on the surface of the sentences that protected her.
<&>「"Sooyoung-ssi! Over there!"」
It was a sentence I knew.
<&>「I could see Lee Seolhwa’s hospital in the distance. The leisurely flowing stories did not bring them down. Stories were pouring in from the wards they knew.」
The scene drawn by the sentence was vivid in front of my eyes.
The people of <Kim Dokja’s Company> were rushing to the hospital.
Their story of waking up again.
The last story of <Kim Dokja’s Company>, which has been struggling to revive just one reader for such a long time.
<&>「The door creaks open. Faint sunlight was coming in through the wide open window.」
<&>「The manuscripts she was editing all night were blown away by the wind and scattered dazzlingly.」
<&>「The story she hadn't finished was there.」
A story written by Han Sooyoung, written down by me, and read by readers.
<&>「A sentence that she definitely wanted to write someday, even if not now. Thinking of that sentence, Han Sooyoung laughed like an idiot.」
It was the 'final scene' of the 『Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint』 we know.
<&>「This is a story for only one reader.」
"For a moment. Stop! Stop!"
With the image of Han Sooyoung stretching out her hand while shouting. A bright light flowed from the snowflake.
And the next moment.
<&>「Lee Hakhyun finally reached the end.」
