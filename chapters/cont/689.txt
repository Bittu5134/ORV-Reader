<title>689 Episode 23 Fragments of God (4)
A huge amount of magical power was flowing out through my right hand, and a bright light appeared above my head.
Dizziness that comes with a feeling of exhaustion.
I could feel the gaze of stars in the sky.
The severed head of the 5th grade dragon species was looking up at me in disbelief.
<!>[You have defeated the 5th grade dragon species mutant Imoogi Bracky!]
…
<!>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is astonished by your action!]
<!>[The constellation 'Goryeo’s First Sword' praises your courage.]
<!>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' gives a thumbs up, saying he is also a descendant of the Korean Peninsula.]
<!>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is interested in your fighting style.]
<!>[Some constellations are interested in the proposal of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]
<!>[A total of 5,000 coins were sponsored!]
From afar, I could see Bang Cheolsoo and the people of Geumho Station cheering in this direction.
<!>[30 seconds left until death.]
It occurred to me that dying like this wasn't that bad.
<!>[The synchronization rate with the sponsor increases.]
<!>[The possibility of a new story germinates.]
—Youngest.
'Yes.'
—You don’t really want to die, do you?
'There are now 20 seconds left.'
Is there any way to survive right now?
Honestly, I don't know.
Should I once again feed myself to the 'Heir of the Eternal Name'?
Will that method work this time too?
<!>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' refuses to prey on you.]
It doesn't work either.
Then there is no way for me.
Now I only trust Kim Dokja.
—Let’s see. It should be somewhere around here... Uh, over there! The head!
'The head?'
—Falling head! Hurry!
When I looked closely, I saw that items had fallen between the monster’s head that had fallen on the floor.
One was the 'core of a 5th grade monster dragon species', and the other was...
"This…"
I was startled and picked up the item that had fallen on the floor.
To be precise, it wasn't an 'item'. It is a fragment that looks like a crude collection of very small letters.
<!>[Fragment of the story 'For a reader, a reader’s life' has been acquired.]
Why on earth does the dragon have this?
—Phew, it was there as expected.
No, why is this—
—Just feed it quickly. If you're being foolish, you'll really be in trouble.
'Do you want me to feed it this?'
—That’s also 'Kim Dokja’s fragment'.
Just by looking at the name, it was clear that it was a fragment of Kim Dokja.
<!>[5 seconds left until death.]
I really don't have time anymore.
<!>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is interested in the story fragment you have acquired!]
'Want some?'
<!>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' opens its mouth greedily.]
Immediately, a sound like biting into a piece of soft meat was heard, and smoke rose from the palm of my hand.
<!>[The time limit has elapsed.]
Was it successful?
Can I keep living?
A series of sentences flowed through my mind as if answering my questions.
<&>「"It's okay, Yoo Sangah."」
"Yes?"
"Even if you tell me about the app, it won’t help."
The genre of my life now is clearly 'realism'.
"Because readers have their own lives."
And in this genre, I am not the protagonist but the 'reader'.」
This scene seems to be a fragment of the story, 'For a reader, a reader’s life'.
Eventually, the sound of the tale burping lightly after finishing its feast was heard.
<!>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' succeeded in predation.]
<!>[The status of the story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' has slightly increased.]
<!>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is somewhat satisfied.]
<!>[1 day time limit has been added.]
1 day!
My life expectancy increased by a whopping day.
—Look at that. I said you wouldn't die here, right?
I was dumbfounded and looked up into the air.
How did Kim Dokja know that this dragon species had 'Kim Dokja’s fragment'?
"Is it possible that this dragon species also appears in Ways of Survival?"
—It does come out, but not like this. No matter what events exist within 'Ways of Survival', this monster cannot be here.
The monster in front of me is a 'dragon species that should not be here right now'.
—However, in this '41st round', an incident occurred that did not appear in any episode of 'Ways of Survival'.
I immediately understood what Kim Dokja said.
In this world, there was only one incident that had nothing to do with 'Ways of Survival'.
Me and the existence of other readers who have read 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint'.
I looked down at the dead monster's head and muttered.
"No way…"
Perhaps this monster has eaten and erased 'readers' that I do not know.
If it has evolved beyond its original level through the fragments obtained in that way.
If that's the case, how many fragments of readers exist in this world? And in the process, how many readers...
—Now, let’s not think about it too complicated. It could just be a fragment that fell on the road and was picked up by chance.
'There's no way something like this is just lying on the street.'
—Well, it's a shame.
From a distance, the 4th grade monster could be seen fighting to the death with Jung Heewon.
—That guy over there has a 'large fragment'.
'Really?'
—I’m sure. I can feel it now.
A larger fragment.
In other words, if I deal with that guy, I can live longer.
<!>[4th grade Earth Dragon species 'Earth Python' activates 'Annihilation Footprints'!]
The entire area shook violently, and a huge seismic wave was generated centered around the guy's feet. Bright red lava overflowed through the cracks in the cracked ground.
As I soared into the air using [Leap], the bloody battle between Jung Heewon and the 4th grade Earth Dragon species was visible at a glance through the clouds of dust and steam.
Jung Heewon injured her thigh and shoulder.
However, the Earth Dragon species also had both wings cut off and one ankle was seriously injured, so it seemed difficult to move.
Strong magical power trembled from Jung Heewon's blade as if trying to determine a match.
Ether Blade.
The blade of pure magical power created through persistent training stretched out, and in an instant, Jung Heewon's divine form disappeared.
<!>[Incarnation 'Jung Heewon' activates 'Kendo Lv.10'!]
Jung Heewon, who appeared from the sky, drew a horizontal trajectory toward the monster's neck.
Even if it is 4th grade, it is an unavoidable blow with injuries like that.
It was the unstoppable victory of Jung Heewon.
However.
—Of course, it’s not an ordinary 4th grade monster.
With a sound like a swoosh, the new form of the 4th grade Earth Dragon species dispersed like smoke.
Jung Heewon made an embarrassed expression.
Before I could warn her, the Earth Dragon species that took over Jung Heewon's rear struck her with its huge tail.
Bang—
With a sound, Jeong Heewon plummeted to the ground.
The clever Earth Dragon left his last move until the last moment.
"Heewon-ssi!"
I repeatedly [jumped] with all my might and held Jung Heewon as she fell to the ground. Dark red blood leaked out from Jung Heewon's mouth.
"Heewon-ssi! Come to your senses!"
She still seems to have not lost her fighting spirit as the aura of [Judgement Time] and [demon slaying] flowed out of her body.
But I could tell just by feeling her pulse.
Jung Heewon was no longer in a state to fight.
I looked back at the rear battle line, which had been sorted out to some extent.
Fortunately, there is no penalty for running away in this scenario.
She needs to run away now.
When it is difficult for the 4th grade Earth Dragon species to move, we should run away as soon as possible—
—No. Catch that guy.
Those were Kim Dokja’s words.
—You don't know when you'll find fragments again. The only chance is now.
I know. That now is an opportunity.
But can I do it?
Will I be able to kill that guy who even Jung Heewon couldn't defeat?
—There is a chance of victory. [Staging] is not finished yet.
As the hazy dust cleared, the brilliant eyes of the 4th grade Earth Dragon species were revealed.
Kim Dokja was right.
A faint fear reflected in its eyes.
It’s afraid of me now.
<!>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is watching your courage.]
—Fight to the death, youngest. If you want to become the real 'Kim Dokja' you want to be.
At that moment, I saw Bang Cheolsoo and Dayoung's mother running from behind.
"Hyung! Heewon-ssi!"
Instead of Bang Cheolsoo, who was carrying Shin Yoosoung, I looked at Dayoung’s mother.
"Please take care of Heewon-ssi."
Dayoung’s mother didn’t hesitate and carried Jung Heewon.
Jung Heewon, who seemed to be still conscious, opened her eyes wide.
I smiled lightly at Jung Heewon and then spoke to my companions.
"From now on, do your best to leave Gwanghwamun."
"Hyung! You too should leave with us—"
"Bang Cheolsoo. I can save myself somehow. Protect the people who trust you first."
Bang Cheolsoo, his eyes red, eventually lowered his head. He also knows that there is no way.
"Withdraw! Everyone, withdraw!"
After Bang Cheolsoo and Dayoung's mother ran away, I looked back at the Earth Dragon.
He too was looking this way, growling as if he was ready for a decisive battle.
<!>[The time limit for 'Staging' is approaching.]
<!>[The power of 'staging' weakens.]
It is difficult.
We can't end the stage already.
"I am-"
As I was preparing for [Incite] once again, I heard Kim Dokja's words.
—Reproducing the same scene continuously is not effective.
I know?
I know. The stage once recreated through 「Staging」 does not have the same level of impact on the constellations.
<!>[A very small number of constellations ask if you are telling the same story again.]
In other words, this time, like before, it was impossible to confront him just by borrowing the power of 'Kim Dokja who hunted Yamata no Orochi'.
'I know.'
But it didn't matter.
Because-
"Because the person I wanted to recreate this time was not 'Kim Dokja'."
Even if the story has the same content, the main character of the story is different.
If it's another person, it's a different story.
The person I will recreate now is—
"I am."
In some ways, that protagonist surpasses even 'Kim Dokja'.
"I am 'Yoo Joonghyuk' who defeated the 'Eight-Headed Monarch' in 'Peaceland'."
As the pages turned in my head, the image of Yoo Joonghyuk and Yamata no Orochi fighting came to mind clearly.
<!>[Fragment of the story 'Crazy Soldier Yoo Joonghyuk' squirms.]
Accordingly, the unidentified story of Yoo Joonghyuk, who I do not know when I acquired it, began to move within me.
<!>[The story 'The One Who Hunted the King of Disasters' responds to the story fragment 'Crazy Soldier Yoo Joonghyuk'.]
I thought I could do it.
It’s Yoo Joonghyuk in the moment when he was dealing with Yamata no Orochi.
Gooooooo!
The aura of Yoo Joonghyuk’s mentor, imbued with the power of stories, was carried on the clear, burning trail of Unbreakable Faith.
The Earth Dragon, startled by the subversive force, hesitated and retreated.
This guy.
I leapt in the air, slashing my sword again and again as if struggling. The magic wave that imitated Yoo Joonghyuk's [stage transfomasion] grew around 'Unbreakable Faith'.
It wasn't easy. Even if I tried my best, reaching Yoo Joonghyuk felt like a long way off.
—I!
'I am.'
But at least I wasn't the only one shouting these words now.
—I am Yoo Joonghyuk!
'I am Yoo Joonghyuk.'
<!>[The synchronization rate with the constellation is increasing!]
<!>[The reproduction rate of the story increases slightly!]
The yellow pupils of the Earth Dragon species became vertically elongated.
The guy was truly shocked. He was so overwhelmed by the story that he began to believe the scenery before his eyes rather than the actual damage he would receive.
Eventually, when the guy's fear reached its peak. The frightened monster's new form scattered in the air.
The technique used on Jung Heewon.
<!>[Fog ability.]
—You got caught, you bastard.
<!>[The special option of 'Unbreakable Faith' is activated.]
The fog's weakness is 'elemental attacks'.
<!>[Ether attribute is converted to 'Flame'.]
I used [Nagak Breathing] to hold my breath and spin like a top, swinging the blade of flame. The particles that came into contact with the flames suffered a crushing blow and began to melt.
Wow!
The Earth Dragon species regaining its form crashed to the ground with its half-burnt body.
At the same time, I was like, wow. And I vomited out the things inside me.
Following the overlapping [Incite], it was the price of enduring the story of my sponsor for too long.
<!>[[Staging] ends.]
The stage ends and the actor leaves.
<!>[The story 'The One Who Hunted the King of Disasters' ends its storytelling.]
I barely raised my head with my hands on the floor. The Earth Dragon species that had collapsed was seen standing up again.
That's it.
The [Fog] ability could no longer be used, but it was still alive and well.
I felt like the atmosphere around me was opening up. He is preparing his final [Breath].
<!>[Fragment of the story 'Crazy Soldier Yoo Joonghyuk' looks at you pitifully.]
Yoo Joonghyuk’s contempt woke me up.
I didn't fall. I can never die here.
I must protect people.
Jung Heewon, Jung Eunho, Sergeant Kim, and the people who saved me. I must buy time for them to escape.
<!>[The synchronization rate with the sponsor is increasing!]
At that moment.
—Good job, youngest.
A warm feeling began to circulate deep within my heart.
<!>[The coordination rate with the sponsor has reached a certain level.]
<!>[A new 'stigmata' has been acquired.]
The power of my constellation spread throughout my body.
<!>[The stigma 'Sacrificial Will Lv.1' is activated!]
Finally, Kim Dokja's first stigmata bloomed.
