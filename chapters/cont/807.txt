<title>807 Episode 39 Rumor (6)
The 'Recorders of Fear' are crashing into this world in the form of 'possession'?
"Are all the Recorders of Fears like that?"
"I'm not sure either."
With that thought, several cases came to mind.
One was 'Bicheonhori' that I met at the 'Recycling Center', and the other was me and other readers.
If the characteristic of 'possession' itself is a characteristic of the Recorders of Fear...
"However, there is this saying. The 'Recorders of Fear' appear and disappear as if they are invading the world line."
They appear and disappear as if they are invading the world line.
I asked, repeating that expression to myself.
"What is their purpose?"
"Well. I guess it's to interpret 'Fear'?"
Fear. That word, which had been repeated before, now sounded unfamiliar.
"What on earth is this 'Fear' that they are talking about?"
"If it could be explained that simply, the name 'Recorder of Fear' wouldn't have existed in the first place."
"Can't you understand it even in a general way?"
"In a general way..."
The story expert began to calmly organize the place he had used. He swept away the story fragments that were scattered in a chaotic manner and neatly put the brushes he had used into his brush. The reason all of his actions seemed to have some meaning was probably because he was a story expert.
The story expert finally finished organizing and opened his mouth.
"What do you think is the greatest story that makes up this world?"
I answered without thinking for long.
"I think it's a 'scenario'."
Everything in this world is made up of 'stories.' And the biggest flow that leads those stories was the 'scenario' hosted by the <Star Stream>.
Tsutsutsut.
I can tell just by looking at the fact that my existence is soon in danger.
This universe is a world where you are granted a 'qualification' just by participating in a scenario. Satisfied with my answer, the story expert nodded and smiled.
"Then where do you think that 'scenario' came from?"
"That's..."
Here, saying that it was actually written by a writer named Han Sooyoung wouldn't be of much help.
Also, even if the designer of the scenario was Han Sooyoung, that wasn't the logical probability that supported this world.
There must be scenarios in this world that Han Sooyoung didn't write.
In addition, Han Sooyoung didn't know all the content of the scenarios from birth.
She must have written the scenarios based on what she learned from other content and her own experiences.
When I thought about it that far, I felt strange. When I thought about it, all the 'great story scenarios' I knew were familiar.
Olympus' <Gigantomachia>.
Eden and the Demon World's <The Great Battle of the Holy Demon>.
The Emperor's <Journey to the West>.
They were all scenarios based on famous stories.
And that's not all? The general scenarios were the same. A battle royale survival game, or a variation of a mafia game.
In the end, scenarios are based on existing 'stories'.
"Aren't most scenarios based on old 'tales'?"
The Doctor nodded again, but didn't smile. It meant that my answer was incomplete.
"That's right. To be more precise."
The Doctor blinked for a moment as if choosing his words, then opened his mouth.
"All scenarios are 'interpreted tales'."
Interpreted tales.
A bright light flashed in my head.
"A very small interpretation of a tale can sometimes change the entire universe."

The elf nodded again and smiled.
"I see you understand now."
"Are the Recorders of Fear the ones who interpret 'uninterpreted tales'?"
"That's what I think."
"Those tales are 'Fears."
Uninterpreted stories are difficult. They are unfamiliar, and sometimes even incomprehensible. The source of that incomprehensibility is fear.
"Even this <Star Stream> has not yet been able to interpret the tales, the Recorders of Fear love such stories."
'Secretive Plotter' suddenly came to mind.
Perhaps the Recorders of Fear admired him because he was the 'uninterpretable being' of all people in this world.
"I heard you are participating in the Fear Expedition this time."
"Yes, that is what happened."
The story expert looked at me with a slightly complicated expression and was about to open his mouth again when.
"The Lord of the House calls."
At the perfect timing, the guard opened the door and appeared. The guard's gaze was unusual, as if he had been eavesdropping on our conversation.
The story expert Lowellyn sighed lightly and looked at me, mouthing.
—I tried to keep you alive, so don't die.
I nodded my head in gratitude.
***
The conversation with the story expert was beneficial in its own way.
The most important thing was the information I gained about the 'Recorders of Fear.'
<&>「Maybe me and other readers are also destined to eventually become 'Recorders of Fear'.」
I decided not to think too deeply about it. Because the information I could know right now was too limited. For now, it was important to deal with the immediate issues one by one.
Steadily, like writing one sentence and then writing the next.
If every moment of my life becomes a story, then eventually this moment will also be written as a story.
In order not to leave this moment as a vague 'Fear', I had to keep thinking and moving.
When Yoo Joonghyuk finished his breakfast, the escorting person came to see us again.
"The expedition team will be announced soon. I think the guests should come with us."
After discussing with the head of the household, we decided to participate in the 'Fear Expedition' as representatives of the Namgung Family.
<!>[A new main scenario is about to begin!]
My heart raced at the thought of finally entering a new scenario. I don't know if it was because I was scared or nervous. I pretended to talk to Yoo Joonghyuk to hide my trembling.
"You suddenly had a trance ritual while listening to the words of the story expert. Did you gain some kind of enlightenment?"
Yoo Joonghyuk shook his head at my question.
"I thought you had transcended."
"If transcending could happen that easily, the martial arts world would already be full of transcendent beings."
"Well, I guess so."
"I have a habit of having a trance ritual whenever I feel like it. I can't miss even the smallest hint of enlightenment."
I realized once again how sincere Yoo Joonghyuk is. No matter how often he acts like a Transcendent, Yoo Joonghyuk is fundamentally a Transcendent who works hard.
He must have lived so diligently to become the ultimate Transcendent after going through 1,863 Regressions.
<!>[Your understanding of the character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has increased.]
<!>[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' shows you a little favor.]
I was startled by the message that suddenly came.
My understanding has suddenly increased?
"What?"
"It's nothing."
I had to bite my lips several times to hide my expression.
When I first met him, I thought he would never be my comrade.
That was understandable, because 'Yoo Joonghyuk of the 41st Round' was considered one of the worst Yoo Joonghyuks among the many Yoo Joonghyuks.
And yet, I was able to gain a little favor from him. That alone felt like enough compensation for my 'martial arts journey'.
"Now that we've entered the Fear Realm, you won't throw me off a cliff, right?"
"What nonsense are you talking about?"
I just shrugged.
Yoo Joonghyuk glared at me with a strange expression and added.
"It seems like you've made some progress."
"Did you notice?"
As expected, the eyes of the Regressor cannot be avoided.
In fact, there was progress for me. Not something profound like enlightenment, but progress that was obvious enough to be seen right away.
<!>[Congratulations! Your story has successfully evolved!]
<!>[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' has evolved into a Mythical-level story!]
Finally, 'Heir to the Eternal Name' has become a Mythical-level story.
I don't know why this story suddenly evolved. Maybe the story, worried that I would soon die, evolved on its own.
<!>[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' snorts.]
Or maybe it was helpful that I spent the whole night wondering about 'Kim Dokja' after talking to the story expert yesterday.
In any case, with this, I finally became the owner of a 'Mythical-level story'.
And the next moment, a bright light began to flow out from Kim Dokja's smartphone.
<!>[The function of the Holy Relic has evolved!]
The function of the Holy Relic has evolved.
Maybe this is the first effect of the 'Mythical tale'.
As soon as I turned on my smartphone, the platform screen appeared first.

Why can't I see the latest episode?
I pressed refresh several times, but the screen didn't change.
What happened to the serialization record? Or—
<&>「Uninterpreted story.」
My head felt dizzy.
I'm now an exile, outside the scenario.
If that's why this moment was 'uninterpreted'. So what if these episodes aren't visible?
It was a plausible assumption, but it wasn't yet certain.
Above all, there was one thing left to check.
<!>[You can check one comment for the desired chapter using the 'Daily Free Pass'.]
Fortunately, I could still check the comments. Does that mean the series was proceeding normally?
I'll know when I check the comments.
<!>[Now, you can check the 'comments with many recommendations' first without using coins.]
<!>[Would you like to use the 'Daily Free Pass'?]
An unexpected suggestion. It seemed that this was an effect added through 「Heir to the Eternal Name」.
Up until now, it was difficult to gather information efficiently because of the 'random comment confirmation system'.
That's understandable, because when you check comments randomly, it was difficult to avoid comments that randomly spammed Yoo Joonghyuk's name or the Demon King of Salvation's name.
However, if I could see only comments with many 'recommendations', it would be a different story. The fact that it was recommended by many readers means that there is a high probability that it has hit the core of that 'chapter'. Above all, it is highly likely that it will avoid meaningless comments. Of course, there was a function to check 'recommended comments' using additional coins in the past, but as the cost increases with each chapter (after chapter 200, it started to demand a whopping 10,000 coins per comment), recently I hardly ever checked the 'recommended comments'.
But they're releasing that feature for free. I couldn't miss this opportunity.
<!>[One free daily ticket will be deducted.]
<!>[Check the comment with the most 'recommendations'.]
I checked the comments right away.
Well, indeed.

I stared at the empty ■ part between 'Eung' and 'i' for a moment.
I thought that uninterpreted stories are scary, but uninterpreted comments might be scary too. That must be it?
Why on earth did this comment get the most upvotes?
I can't understand what Kim Dokja is thinking right now.
I checked the second comment.

Sometimes, comments are scarier when interpreted.
<&>「Isn't this really how I die?」
I blankly stared at the comment, then suddenly went back to the first comment and checked how many times '엉■이' was used.
It was 41 times in total.
At that moment, a series of keywords came together in my head.
엉■이, 41. 팡■. He's not really going to die like this?
Wait a minute, this can't be.
I reflexively looked around and muttered.
"Yoo Joonghyuk."
And then the real fear began.
"Yoo Joonghyuk?"
Yoo Joonghyuk disappeared.
