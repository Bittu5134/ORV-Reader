<title>832 Episode 43 Transcendent Alliance (1)
Cheok Jungyeong thought about the word death for the first time in a while.
He couldn't even remember when he last thought of death. Was it when he was repeatedly beating the heavenly beings right before becoming a constellation, or when he was being chased by [Fate] that was unleashed after fighting the giant nebulae after becoming a constellation?
He couldn't help but snicker.
Perhaps the reason he was having such unnecessary thoughts was because his history was once again in crisis.
<!>[You've become stronger than before. You damned bastard.]
Cheok Jungyeong said as he watched the Outer God walking slowly from afar.
The founder of the absolute throne.
Some call him a 'genius-level fear'. Unlike other Outer Gods who were at the level of natural disasters, he had extremely high intelligence and the habit of moving like a human.
<!>[What kind of stories have you stolen again?]
Despite Cheok Jungyeong's provocation, the founder of the absolute throne did not respond and only rattled his skeleton. Cheok Jungyeong, who knew that it was the guy's laughter, simply bit his lips and swung his sword.
However, his body was swept away by the wind the founder swung and was instantly thrown to the edge of the fault.
Inside the fear realm, the Outer Gods regain their original power.
<!>[The story, 'Greed of the Immortal King', begins its storytelling.]
<!>[The story, 'Longing of the Fear Monarch', begins its storytelling.]
<!>[The story, 'Mystery of the Old Being', begins its storytelling.]
…
The tales of the ancient times that the constellations had ignored were shining brightly in the body of the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne'.
This was a 'natural disaster level fear' that could destroy a world.
However, Cheok Jungyeong was not foolishly taken advantage of either.
<!>[The story, 'One Who Cuts the Sea', begins its storytelling.]
In the fear realm, the transcendents were also able to exert power beyond their capabilities.
<!>[The story, 'Manbyungguijang', begins its storytelling.]
<!>[The story, 'Dream Enemy', begins its storytelling.]
Stories, and fears accumulated while clearing various time faults.
The fears they fought against were their weapons themselves.
<!>[Disaster-level fear, 'Yong-A-Geom', begins its storytelling.]
Fear equipment tailored to Cheok Jungyeong.
As the long blade that grew in an instant took its place in Cheok Jungyeong's right hand, a black armor immediately enveloped Cheok Jungyeong's entire body.
<!>[Disaster-level fear, 'Crow Armor', activates!]
This was the full power posture of Cheok Jungyeong, the third captain of the fear realm, the first swordsman of Goryeo.
He fought like a berserker. He didn’t collapse even after being struck by dozens of arrows all over his body, after being struck by the flying sword.
He swung his sword once, then twice, and then thrice again.
A sword that could cut down a thousand people, destroy mountains, and cut down the sea.
But even with that sword, he couldn’t cut down the Outer God in front of him.
<!>[It’s been a long time since I haven’t been able to kill someone even with the three swords.]
With a gurgling sound, a teardrop flowed from the corner of Cheok Jungyeong’s mouth. The incarnation body, which had reached its limit, shook precariously. The broken 'Crow Armor' scattered into ashes, and the Dragon Sword, which had lost its light, was stuck in the ground.
Cheok Jungyeong slowly felt the end approaching.
Push it.
The last thing that came to mind was his disciple’s pale face.
Still, he thought it was fortunate. Even if he were to disappear here, his swordsmanship wouldn’t disappear.
As his consciousness faded, Cheok Jungyeong continued to recall his disciple’s face in his mind. At that moment when his vision was about to completely blur, a voice that seemed to pull out Cheok Jungyeong’s soul was heard.
"Master, are you okay?"
Cheok Jungyeong looked back with a blank expression.
<!>[This, this crazy—]
"I’m here."
<!>[This damn disciple!]
Cheok Jungyeong hurriedly looked around. There were no surviving members of the Third Squadron nearby.
He instinctively blocked his disciple’s path.
<!>[Escape quickly! I’ll buy you time!]
"Then, Master will die."
<!>[I’m a constellation! I won’t disappear just because my incarnation body disappears!]
"But you’ll take a blow that’s close to death."
His disciple was right.
Just because you’re a constellation doesn’t mean you’re invincible. Especially if the essence of the story is damaged in the process of losing your incarnation body, you could easily be annihilated.
<!>[Are you alone? What about the other captains?]
Cheok Jungyeong asked out of curiosity. If someone like Kyrgios, Yoo Hosung, or even someone like Ryunard had come in, the situation would have been a little better.
"I'm alone."
<!>[What the hell!]
"Don't worry. I'll take care of everything."
<!>[What can you do!]
Even Cheok Jungyeong knows that his disciple is strong. At that age, he's talented enough to use even the second sword of the three swords.
However, his opponent was none other than the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne'. No matter how talented he was, in front of that 'Natural Disaster Fear'—
<#>【Ooooooooo?】
The atmosphere of the battlefield changed in an instant. The 'Founder of the Absolute Throne' who had been approaching with a terrifying momentum suddenly stood still.
He could feel the emotions of the Outer God through the eerie wind.
Confusion. And… fear.
Fearful? That Outer God is afraid? Of who on earth?
Cheok Jungyeong slowly turned his head following the Outer God's gaze. There stood his disciple who was emitting bright light from his entire body.
<!>[What, what is that, disciple?]
"It's not that great. It's just that I have a story that he would hate."
A story?
<!>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', chuckles.]
At first glance, it was a great myth-level story. However, in a sense, it was 'just a story'. How could a 'natural disaster' Outer God stop because of a story?
"Master. If there's a way to defeat him, will you help me?"
He didn't know what the situation was, but it seemed certain that the clever disciple had a plan.
<!>[Of course. Is there really a way?]
For a moment, Cheok Jungyeong felt a strange feeling. It felt like he had experienced a similar situation, but different.
"Yes. Then."
The disciple smiled brightly and pointed to his stomach.
"First, would you knock me out?"
***
The moment I entered the time fault, I realized that I was screwed.
"Wow."
It was good that I entered confidently. It wasn't bad that I declared that I would deal with that guy.
However, the moment I saw the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne' filling the sky, the goosebumps on my spine didn't go away.
<#>【Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh】
It was on a whole other level than when I saw it near the 'Void Curtain' sometime ago. It looked dozens of times bigger than then.
That was the true form of the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne'.
I knew it instinctively. No matter who I followed with [Bookmark] or [Incite], it was impossible for me to deal with that guy with my current incarnation body.
So there was only one thing I could trust.
<&>「Staging.」
In this <Star Stream>, 'history' is powerful enough to surpass the power of probability.
And I had the experience of defeating that guy once. But could I kill him with just this 'stage'?
Honestly, I wasn't confident. Above all, my incarnation body was so weak that it couldn't even handle Cheok Jungyeong's 'Three Swords'.
However, there was a way to overcome that.
"Heir-ah."
<!>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', asks if you really called him.]
"Help me."
<!>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', grumbles as if it's annoying.]
"Oh, don't you want to see the second one?"
Ultimately, this 'Heir of the Eternal Name' guy's goal is to create the 'one and only Kim Dokja'.
He must also understand that he has no choice but to listen to me in order to do that.
<!>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', grumbles and begins its storytelling.]
And he must know very well what skill I need right now.
"Master! Now!"
The next moment, Cheok Jungyeong's sword hit my abdomen.
With a scream, the world spun around and I lost consciousness.
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint', is activated.]
It's not the [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] that I used, but the [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] that the 'Demon King of Salvation' used.
As I felt the skill being activated, the 'Demon King of Salvation's' characteristic elation filled my whole body.
I can do it.
It's a method I've never tried in the main story, but it might be possible now.
<!>[Your understanding of the constellation 'Goryeo's First Sword' is high.]
Because.
<!>[The target has a deep favor toward you.]
My understanding of 'Goryeo's First Sword, Cheok Jungyeong' is higher now than ever before in the main story.
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint', stage 3 is activated!]
'I'll borrow your incarnation body for a moment, Master.'
A full energy permeated my whole body.
When I opened my eyes again, I was in a state of empathy with Cheok Jungyeong's incarnation body. The 'Founder of the Absolute Throne' who saw my appearance from afar let out a threatening cry.
<#>【Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh】
Just hearing it a little while ago was a chilling roar, but now it was somehow acceptable.
Because I am now the best warrior in Goryeo.
The strongest incarnation.
I was able to be sure only after I had entered. At least, there is no being stronger than Cheok Jungyeong in a human body right now.
However, even with this astonishing incarnation body, it was difficult to deal with that Outer God. But,
"It's different on this 'stage'."
The story took root on top of 'Unbreakable Faith', and an unprecedentedly bright 'Blade of Faith' colored the surroundings.
<!>['Staging' begins!]
Is it because the story has evolved over time?
The scenery that unfolded before my eyes was not the scene of Gwanghwamun where Kim Dokja destroyed the absolute throne.
A scene of a pitch-black curtain billowing overhead. This was—
<#>【Ga ah ah ah ah ah ah】
Where I lost Han Sooyoung.
<&>「How much stronger have I become since then?」
The image of Han Sooyoung collapsing in my arms was still vivid.
Old resentment welled up.
Memories of surviving under the rippling curtain of emptiness with her help swirled through my head.
<&>「"I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the story you wanted."」
Where is Han Sooyoung, who said that, now?
I wonder if she's still watching this story somewhere in this universe.
She must be. She must be watching.
<&>「This was proof of the oath I made that day.」
The sword power that had grown explosively cut down the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne'. The astonished guy screamed. At the same time, the giant blade he swung slashed at my entire body, aiming for it. Every time I blocked the blade, I felt a shock as if my bones were crushed.
Even so, I didn’t stop. Attacks that took each other’s flesh and bones.
I recalled the days I lived desperately, swinging my sword again and again.
The countless nights I studied the stories.
The hours I read the 'Ways of Survival'.
The days I tried to show Han Sooyoung 'my story' that I had promised.
<#>【Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh】
Han Sooyoung, I’m sorry.
Maybe I hadn’t grown much at that point. I’m still ridiculously weak to show my story.
But still.
At least now, I—
<&>「I’ve become a little more like Kim Dokja.」
<&>「King of a Kingless Worldwas written on the tip of the sword that cut briskly.」
The 'Founder of the Absolute Throne' who was fatally wounded by the stories that suddenly popped out let out a gasp of shock.
"Do you feel it now? That it’s different from back then?"
I knew who my smiling expression resembled, and who my speech resembled.
I used to be afraid of becoming a Kim Dokja. Now I am not.
Because I know that becoming a Kim Dokja or becoming like Kim Dokja does not mean losing myself.
Thinking like Kim Dokja does not mean that the 'Lee Hakhyun' inside me disappears.
After all, all people end up becoming like someone.
"You may not know, but I have had many experiences."
I thought of the people who were imbued with the name of Kim Dokja. Among those names were Gu Seonah and Kim Kyungsik, who risked their lives for their colleagues. There was Jung Jaewoo, who was luckier than anyone else, there was Go Jangwon, who gave his life for Jung Heewon's younger sibling, and there was No Jiyoon, who missed her father until the very end.
Therefore, the fact that I am now a Kim Dokja.
<!>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', shines brightly.]
It means that I can remember more people.
