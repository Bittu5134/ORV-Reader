<title>814 Episode 40 Terror order (6)
According to my prediction, the reason why the 'traffic light' signal didn't change is summarized in two ways.
One, because there is no 'concept' of normal time in the terror order.
Two, because that traffic light is a 'special' traffic light.
The sound of teeth grinding was heard from behind once again. Either way, I didn't have much time left.
<!>[Activate exclusive skill 'Incite Lv. 10'!]
Let's do something.
I shouted urgently at the traffic light.
"You can perceive 'time' from now on!"
If the green light didn't turn on because of the 'concept of time', then this [Incite] would definitely work. However, the traffic light didn't change.
Okay, then how about this?
"You are a 'traffic light with a green light'!"
I thought it was a much more certain method than before. 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds. This time, the traffic light didn't change.
Damn, it's not working.
Is the probability of [incite] lacking?
Is it because they are inanimate objects without egos?
Or do the beings inside this 'terror' have an immune system against my [incite]?
I was curious, but I didn't have time to think about it.
If the first method didn't work, it was time to use the second method.
<&>「A traffic light that doesn't change.」
If that traffic light is a 'special traffic light' and doesn't change, there must be some kind of rule. And I think that 'rule' I guess is this.
I slowly closed my eyes and took a deep breath.
How many seconds did that last?
Even though I closed my eyes, I suddenly felt my vision become clearer, and as if by magic, another traffic light appeared next to me.
It was a traffic light that matched the one on the other side. I slowly looked at the pillar toward the traffic light, and the button I expected was there.
<&>「Audible signal for the visually impaired」
There it was! Of course it was! I pressed the button without hesitation. Then, a strange sound began to flow out from the traffic light.
<!>[If you have trouble with your eyes, raise your right hand and cross.]
The mechanical sound that flowed out was quite ominous, but there was still a sense of joy at having guessed correctly.
The moment I raised my right hand and was about to take my first step.
<!>[Exclusive trait 'Record Repairer' warns you.]
My instinct, which has been repeating writing for many years, warned me. If I take my first step like this, I will be torn to pieces and die like those incarnations just now.
<&>「This is not an appropriate interpretation of this 'horror.'」
I had a strong feeling, although I don't know why.
So what did I miss?
I didn't think long.
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv. 10' is activated!]
The traffic light said, 'If you have trouble with your eyes, raise your right hand and cross.'
Even with my [incite] I couldn't instill the concept of time in the traffic light.
But what if the target was 'me'?
"I can't see."
At the same time as the [incite], my vision was plunged into darkness. In the complete darkness where no light could penetrate, I began to walk with my right hand raised and trembling.
Evening, step, step.
The sound of my footsteps was louder than usual. Is this right? If I keep walking like this, will I be able to cross all the crosswalks? Will a car that came running from somewhere hit me?
The fear that I might be wrong. That inorganic desolation suffocated me. 
As I walked a few more steps, my hearing gradually replaced the place where my vision disappeared. Another world made of sounds was there.
The sounds that had been entangled with each other began to separate one by one in the sharp darkness.
The sound of me breathing. The sound of my steps. The sound of my clothes brushing dry. The sound of a shark's head chattering its teeth.
And... And the sound of someone walking beside me.
<!>[You're doing well.]
I got goosebumps all over my body.
Who on earth is that? Who is talking? I was so scared that I ran across the crosswalk in an instant. When I opened my eyes after completing the steps I had planned in my head, I had already passed the crosswalk quite a bit.
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv. 10' has been unlocked.]
I couldn't see the person who had spoken to me.
What on earth was that?
Is it an illusion?
<!>[Catastrophic horror — 'Alien traffic lights' has been unlocked.]
<!>[You have perfectly interpreted the catastrophic horror.]
<!>[Interpretation success!]
<!>[Interpretation suggestion: Sometimes, you can catch a glimpse of another world just by closing your eyes.]
<!>[The terror spirit is satisfied with your interpretation.]
<!>[A special interpretation reward is given.]
An interpretation reward was given this time too. However, unlike the last time, this time it was a 'special interpretation reward'.
The real story fragment I had obtained by clearing the first gate was 'fictionalized'. To be honest, the name of the fragment was so abstract that I couldn't figure out what it was used for, but this time, the reward was different.
<!>[You acquired the fragment 'Wonryo Signal Controller'.]
As soon as I called out the story, a small remote control appeared in front of me.
I held the remote control in my hand. Somehow, I felt like I knew how to use it.
The shark head that had been running towards me from afar, emitting pitch-black smoke, was shaking its head left and right and looking around. It seemed like it had lost my location.
"Here, you punk!"
The guy who heard my voice started running towards me again.
It was exactly in the direction of the traffic light I had crossed.
I slowly stepped back and checked the distance between us.
Come a little closer. Just a little closer.
The moment the guy finally crossed the crosswalk, the guy who had been charging like a mad bull suddenly stopped.
The guy's two eyes were looking straight at the traffic light.
For a moment, I was dumbfounded.
Damn, even that 'shark head' obeys the signal?
Okay, then.
<&>「This is a true story of how you can control the 'traffic light' of the terror spirit at will.」
When I pressed the button on the remote control, the light of the traffic light changed to 'green'.
The guy started to cross the crosswalk as if he had been waiting. When he crossed the street, I didn't hesitate and pressed the button again. And then.
What I expected happened right before my eyes. With a flash of light, the day or the cost hit the guy.
Kudduk. Thump. Gwajijik.
A terrible bursting sound bursting out of the true body of the outer god.
<#>【Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa】
I covered my ears and didn't take my eyes off the scene of the disaster. The guy's body was turning into rags in real time. Holes were drilled all over the giant shark's body and spines were sticking out. Broken canines and molars flew through the air.
But.
<#>【Ooooooooooooooo】
The guy didn't die. It was coming towards me step by step without dying.
Tenacious and incredible vitality.
It seemed that this level of 'fear' wouldn't be enough to kill the guy.
<#>【Pick a toothpick...】
While running, I thought of a way to get rid of that outer god, but no plausible method came to mind. For now, the best solution was to use the fear hidden in the 'Terror Spirit' to shake it off.
<&>「There are three fears I can use in the 'Terror Spirit' entrance area.」
I counted the number of forks I had been running through so far.
<&>「After passing the 'seven' forks in the entrance area, 'that place' appears.」
As expected, the 'fork' at the traffic light was exactly the 'seventh'.
In fact, after passing the last fork, the side road gradually felt wider.
I think I ran for a few hundred meters more.
<!>[An 'unknown Fear' is looking at you.]
There was a tunnel with an eerie light.
A disaster-level fear, the 'Festival Tunnel.'
It looked really unpleasant from the outside. Nevertheless, I had to go in there. That's because the 'fear' I was looking for was inside that tunnel.
<&>「There are seven 'horrors' hidden inside the 'festival tunnel'.」
This tunnel is a 'horror that hides fear'.
It was a fear that simply hid other fears.
I immediately activated [Way of the Wind] and ran towards the tunnel. As soon as I entered the tunnel entrance, the first fear greeted me.
<!>[A 'nameless fear' is chasing you!]
Then, small cracks began to spread on the floor.
A catastrophe-level fear, 「Race Cracks」.
This crack occurs the moment someone enters the tunnel. If you run slower than the spreading cracks, the floor of the tunnel will immediately collapse and swallow up the target.
Of course, the cracks could not be faster than me who activated [Way of the Wind].
When I ran about a hundred steps like that, some of the lights on the ceiling of the tunnel began to blink.
<!>[A 'nameless fear' is watching you!]
A catastrophe-level fear, 「The lights that turn off the world.」
I calmly adjusted my running direction and avoided the lights.
You should never approach a place with a blinking light.
What happens if you do?
You disappear.
What happens after you disappear is not written in the 'Ways of Survival'.
Then I witnessed several more horrors.
A woman in a white dress loitering around the edge of the tunnel.
A bike rushed in from the opposite direction I was running in after a while.
I ignored it and continued running.
<#>【This! This...】
Disaster-level fear, 「war air defense.」
That was the name of the fear I was looking for. This fear was the only 「safe fear」 that the expedition team of the terror spirit had found in the entry area, and it was the only one that provided absolute protection from external enemies as long as they were inside the air defense shelter.
However, the bunker's usage time is 3 hours.
After 3 hours, the user is forcibly ejected.
I planned to somehow get inside and buy time while thinking about the next operation.
However, the bunker was nowhere to be seen.
It was strange. 'Ways of Survival' clearly said it was around here.
Then, information flashed through my head.
<&>「The expedition team was not safe in the last 3 fear-type expeditions.」
What if there were strange signs in the 'Expedition' in this World Mountain?
So what if the fears in the fear-type first-up area were replaced by things I didn't know about?
So,
<&>「What if the 'War Bunker' no longer exists?」
The sound of collision was heard right behind me. The hot breath of the shark's head tickled the back of my head.
The creature that even [Way of the Wind] couldn't shake off.
Cold sweat ran down my spine.
I couldn't die here.
I ran and ran. My breath was getting heavier and my magic was running out. My heart was throbbing because I was running so desperately.
Wait a minute. Heart?
Woohoohoo.
When did it start? The smartphone I had put in my coat pocket was ringing. It was a call.
I got goosebumps again.
Since I arrived in this world, not once has anyone called me. What kind of nameless fear is this?
However, the moment I checked the caller's name on the screen, I thought it was okay if it was a fear.
<&>「Second Kim Dokja」
I answered the phone.
