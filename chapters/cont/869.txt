<title>869 Episode 47 King of Fear (13)
All scenarios in the <Star Stream> have a 'scenario number'.
From 1 to 99. The scenario number represents the difficulty of the scenario and is designed to impose a level of probability appropriate to the difficulty.
This was a kind of safety net to prevent the 'transcendent beings' of the upper scenarios from intruding into the lower scenarios.
<&>「There is no scenario number in the Fear Realm.」
<?>*After dozens of chapters, Google Translate telling me I could have translated 'Terror Spirit' as 'Fear Realm' since the beginning.*I had forgotten that fact for quite some time.
Even if there was no scenario number, since it came from 'Murim', a 20th scenario area anyway, I vaguely guessed that the 'Fear Realm' would have a difficulty level appropriate to it.
<&>「But is the difficulty of the 'Fear Realm' really '20th scenario’s' level?」
It was strange when I thought about it.
This is because the 'Fear Realm' has a special space called 'Time Fault'. Each fault boasts a vastly different level of difficulty.
Even the 'Time Fault' that I cleared was based on the 'Last Scenario' of the 40th Round.
The last scenario.
No matter how much of an experience it is, there's no way that the '20th scenario' boasts such an absurd level of difficulty.
Kwakwakwakwakwa!
When Zeus and other <Olympus> warships rushed in beyond the broken 'Big House', I realized once again that there was something seriously wrong with the 'Fear' scenario.
Tsutsutsutsu.
A storm of probability was raging in the sky.
Normally, the constellations in the sky would have been torn apart like scraps of paper the moment the storm struck.
However, it wasn't the constellations that were being torn apart, but the Outer Gods.
<#>【That ah ah ah ah ah ah ah】
The Outer Gods traveling near the cliff fault were trampled by the constellations' boots. The flash cannons emitted from the battleship were destroying the cliffs of the 'Big House'.
I had never seen such a sight even in the last scenario of the 40th Round. That was because Cheon Inho and Yoo Jonghyuk had already destroyed most of the main forces of the nebulae.
"Ah, ah..."
Anna Croft groaned and staggered, and I stood beside her, looking up at the sky in panic.
That was the true power of the 'Giant Nebula'.
<#>【Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh】
The floor of the Big House rose and otherworldly deities appeared.
The headless dragon that roared through the sky, the giant babies that guarded the outskirts of the 'Big House'.
The 'Dream Eater' also let out a roar and stretched out its tentacles.
<#>【Mak ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah】
And that wasn't all. There were also fears that had already been defeated by the captains. For example, the 'Dragon Eater', the 'Darkness That Descends'. And—
<#>【Kaka Kaka Kaka Kaka】
I also saw the appearance of the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne' that I had defeated.
Like Jang Hayoung who first appeared as a Fighter, the Outer Gods covered in pitch-black shadows stood by the 'King of Fear'.
The Outer Gods who drew their weapons only to protect Kim Dokja.
<#>【Protect the King of Fear】
If even one of these Outer Gods were dropped into the scenario area, the area would be devastated. Hope welled up as I realized that fact anew.
Maybe.
With the power of the 'King of Fear' and the fears he rules, they might be able to bring down the 'Giant Nebula' that was all-out.
<#>【Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah】
And.
<#>【Oh oh oh oh oh oh】
The war had begun.
"Join us! Quickly!"
I carried Yoo Joonghyuk and held Anna Croft's hand, and hid myself in the pouring gunfire.
<!>[The story, 'Pebble and I', begins its storytelling.]
Relying on a weak story, we watched the scenery of the 'Big House' where everything was falling apart.
Until now, I thought that the constellations were afraid of Outer Gods. That's why I believed that whenever Outer Gods appeared, the constellations ran away or kept silent.
However, not all constellations were like that.
<!>[The great story of <Olympus> begins its storytelling!]
The constellations that make up the main part of the story do not fear Outer Gods.
The arrow shot by the omnipotent sun Apollo brought down the headless dragon flying in the sky, and Achilles, Jason, and other great constellations knocked down the giant babies.
<!>[Hahahahahaha! How fun!]
Ares, the ferocious god of war who was riding the Gigantes, laughed as he cut off the leg of the 'Dream Eater'.
<!>[Fire!]
Gwagwagwagwagwagwa!
<#>【Oh oh oh oh oh oh】
The 'Dream Eater', who was hit by the battleship's flash cannon, twisted his body and let out a painful cry.
Following that, the Gigantes unit led by Ares began to cut down the main body of the 'Dream Eater'.
<#>【Woo woo woo woo woo woo】
Even if it wasn't his own power, it was the first time I had seen an Outer God being so helpless.
Of course, not all the Outer Gods were helpless. There were Outer Gods who jumped into the midst of the great constellations and slaughtered them mercilessly.
<#>【Ka kaka kaka kaka kaka】
It was the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne'.
Every time the famous swords held in his four hands made of bone drew a trajectory, the great constellations of <Olympus> were sliced ​​up like toys.
However, there was a constellation that blocked his path. With a rough crack, the constellation that breathed out hot breath like lava spoke.
<!>[I wanted this guy's weapons.]
It was the volcanic blacksmith, 'Hephaestus', who swung a huge hammer.
<!>[Kuaaaaap!]
As Hephaestus slammed his huge right foot into the ground, violent waves of stories erupted in an instant, causing large and small injuries to occur throughout the entire body of the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne'.
However, the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne' did not stay still either.
<!>[Death]
Just two syllables. The great constellations within a radius of several dozen meters fell down at the sound of the lion's roar contained in those syllables. The incarnations of the fallen great constellations were all bleeding from their ears.
Hephaestus, who received the lion's roar from the front, also ground his teeth with bloodshot eyes.
<!>[Athena! Artemis! Join us!]
Did he think it would be difficult alone? At his request for reinforcements, two more of the Twelve Sages joined in.
Athena's "Aegis" protected Hephaestus from the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne', and Artemis' arrows, which took advantage of the gap, struck the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne's' thighs and forearms.
<#>【Ka Ka Ka Ka Ka Ka】
The 'Founder of the Absolute Throne' fought bravely against the three Twelve Sages. Even with his arms broken and his legs broken, he maintained his royal dignity until the end.
<!>[Kwaaak! That damned Outer God—!]
Even in the midst of all this, the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne', who succeeded in blowing off one of Hephaestus's arms, laughed as his skull rattled.
Perhaps it was a natural result.
While the Outer Gods risked their lives to attack, the constellations were only cautiously taking the offensive in order to avoid getting even a single wound.
Watching the Outer Gods' resistance, I did not lose hope. Just hold on a little longer. Even if it is a 'giant gate', even if this is the 'Fear Realm' without a scenario number, the aftershock of probability will not allow this kind of scenery to continue.
However, it seems that I was not the only one who thought that.
<!>[Get out of the way.]
A voice that made my heart sink just by hearing it.
As Hephaestus shuddered and got out of the way, a giant trident pointed ahead.
<&>「His play created the boundary of the sea.」
The moment the surging tale gave me goosebumps, a huge wave swept over the area.
I held on to Anna Croft and Yoo Joonghyuk and hid behind the severed leg of the 'Dream Eater'.
Kwaaaaaaaah!
The fears that the 'King of Fear' had carefully collected were disappearing from the world one by one. The headless dragon, the Dream Eater, and the Founder of the Absolute Throne. The 'fear' revealed under the brilliant starlight was no longer fear. They were just vagabonds who had been kicked out of the scenario and lost their place.
Poseidon, the 'Spear that Draws the Boundary of the Sea' that had taken over Traiana, declared.
<!>[Take care of it.]
The constellations carrying the legend of the giant nebula on their backs began to slaughter the fleeing 'Outer Gods'.
I just stood there trembling in front of the scenery that made my imagination powerless.
What on earth could come to stop their tyranny?
Someone stood in front of the Outer Gods in my stead as I was just thinking.
The white, shining butterfly wings reflected the light pouring out from the constellations.
<!>[Stop it.]
Zeus, who had discovered the 'King of Fear', aimed at Astraphe once again. The battleship emitted light.
Kukuaquaquaquaqua!
It was a truly terrible bombing. It was a fierce attack on the giant gate where no living thing could survive. Even if he was Kim Dokja or the King of Fear, he couldn't withstand this attack.
"Damn, it hurts. Take it easy."
But there was someone who took the attack instead.
Between the scattered rays of light, the old man waved his blackened hands and clicked his tongue.
"Hehe, the Dream Eater I raised with great effort ended up like this."
The 'Dream Eater' who had fallen to the floor cried sadly. As the old man lightly patted the head of the Outer God and smiled bitterly, the boy who appeared next to him said.
"You can raise him again, old man."
"I'm saying this because it might take hundreds of years, you punk."
Those who resisted the starlight even in the midst of the hellish landscape. There were calm faces there, as if they had experienced this kind of disaster hundreds of times before.
<!>[Transcendent Alliance.]
With Poseidon's words, the leaders of the Transcendent Alliance stood guard over the 'King of Fear'.
<!>[Constellations, from here on out, I cannot allow it.]
Paradox Baekcheong Kyrgios.
<!>[I wonder how many stars it takes to gather to form a 'constellation'.]
Breaking the Sky Sword Master Namgung Minyoung.
<!>[Hahahahaha! The day has finally come when I can fight you guys!]
Even Goryeo's best swordsman Cheok Jungyeong.
However, Zeus's expression, who was leading the way, did not waver even with the appearance of the Transcendents. Rather, a faint smile formed on Zeus' lips as if he was glad of their appearance.
<!>[There are more sacrifices to place on the scale of probability.]
The 12 gods under Zeus rushed at the Transcendents.
Athena and Breaking the Sky Sword Master clashed, and Kyrgios and Hephaestus's weapons clashed. The first swordsman of Goryeo, Cheok Jungyeong, and the fierce god of war Ares, fought each other's brute strength, firing their lion's roar.
When Zeus raised the holy relic 'Astrape', the warships began to fire again.
This time, the one who blocked the fire was Chunghuh, the commander-in-chief of the Transcendent Alliance and the God of Despair.
Zeus was annoyed by Chunghuh and said.
<!>[Get out of the way. Mortals from another dimension, it’s not your place to get involved.]
"Hehe, I’m sorry, but I have no choice but to get involved."
Chunghuh continued, firmly blocking the King of Fear.
"If you destroy this 'Fear Realm', it will be difficult for us to maintain our existence."
Chunghuh said that and turned his head once more to look around.
Was it a coincidence? His eyes were staring straight at me, who had used 「Pebble and Me」.
Chunghuh nodded lightly at me.
"At least I can’t die yet. I just found out that the guy I really want to meet is alive."
Zeus seemed to no longer feel the need to talk, so he jumped down from the front and swung his spear himself.
Chunghuh, the God of Despair, bravely swung his sword in front of the mythical constellation’s action. The sky of the Fear Realm flashed like a giant light bulb, and ceaseless thunder struck the ground.
Even as his entire body burned black, the God of Despair was holding onto Zeus’s tale.
A terrifying fight. It was a fight I could not dare to get involved in. Nevertheless, on the one hand, I felt that I had to get involved.
Because I had the huge story I had gained from the 40th Time Fault.
<&>「I have faced 'Zeus' before.」
I know that the situation is different now. I also know that the difference in class is absurdly severe.
Nevertheless, if only I could recreate that stage once more.
—Don’t think nonsense.
The one who stopped me was Cheok Jungyeong. While fighting against the ferocious God of War, Cheok Jungyeong was speaking to me through [Earth].
—It is not the time to use that yet. You cannot handle this fight.
I shook my head. I know that I am no help now. But...
—Disciple.
The moment I heard Cheok Jungyeong’s voice continuing, I realized that Cheok Jungyeong was very tired.
It wasn’t just him.
Kyrgios, Breaking the Sky Swordsmaster, and the other Transcendents were also very tired.
Perhaps it was natural.
They had only recently returned from the 40th Round’s Time Fault with me.
I became anxious.
What should I do? What should I do to help them?
—There is something you must do.
As if reading my thoughts, Choi Jungyeong continued.
—Go and press the 'button'.
A button?
A memory suddenly came to mind.
When I first entered the End Zone and visited the 'Time Fault Room', I had seen a 'button' there.
The button at the top of the Time Fault.
0th Squad Captain Ryunard said this about that button.
<&>「"Just press that. That's the 'reset' button of this 'End Zone'."」
The reset button of the end zone.
—If you press that button.
I saw Cheok Jungyeong's sword shatter under the spear swung by the ferocious God of War.
Cheok Jungyeong, whose belly was pierced, smiled at me and said.
—Everything that happened in the 'Fear Realm' will be 'as if it never happened'.
