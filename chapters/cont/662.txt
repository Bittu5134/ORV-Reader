<title>662 Episode 19 Reader (4)
Ja Sungwoo had a good memory since he was young.
It was so good that he could completely remember the moment when his parents abandoned him and his younger sister in front of the orphanage when he was four years old—the snowy streets, his mother's expression, his younger sister crying, and the cold of the dawn that struck him every second.
These were memories he would like to forget if he could. Since his memories could not be erased, he decided to make them meaningless by accumulating more memories.
—You really like books. Are you going to be a writer when you grow up?
The words of the daycare teacher who was stroking his head.
—I'm just going to be a person who reads a lot of books.
He also remembered the expression the daycare teacher made right after hearing those words.
Read, read, read again.
While he was reading it like that, sometimes he would also read it to someone else.
—I have all the books.
His sister had no recollection of the time she was abandoned.
It could be because she was too young, or it could be because she was blind from a young age. Either way, Ja Sungwoo was a little jealous of his younger sister who couldn't remember what happened.
Maybe that's why he deliberately chose books that seemed boring to read to her.
—Literary magazine.
—Read it to me.
Looking back, it was his younger sister who made him read that novel.
He was reading books by his younger sister's favorite author as usual, but suddenly his younger sister said she wanted to read the author's new work.
So he looked up the author's new work on the daycare teacher's computer.
<&>「Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint.」
It was a strange title.
The first web novel he read. He thought it was good because there was a lot of it. The more texts he reads, the more distant his childhood memories will become.
It was a novel he read with that in mind.
—Brother.
But when he came to his senses. He was reading the novel over and over again dozens of times.
—Why do you like that novel?
When his younger sister asked that question. Ja Sungwoo answered this way.
—No matter how much I read it, I don’t understand the ending.
All novels are fiction.
In other words, it is the author's lie.
Ja Sungwoo also knew.
He is not Kim Dokja. He is not even a 'fragment of Kim Dokja'. It makes no sense both probabilistically and chronologically.
Nevertheless, Ja Sungwoo often thought like that.
In fact, if there really is a 'past' that he cannot remember.
If there is a <Star Stream>, Yoo Jonghyuk, and Han Sooyoung somewhere in this universe, it is the story he forgot, the image he loved. Not his parents who abandoned him.
What is his origin? If only he existed there.
"I am Yoo Jonghyuk."
Killer King Ja Sungwoo, who suddenly opened his eyes, analyzed the situation with his cold eyes. A world that only existed in print. The fiction that existed as a lie from the author unfolded vividly before his eyes.
<&>「The Lesser Dragon roared into the air.」
The world he dreamed of has now become a reality.
<!>[The phase 'heat' is beginning.]
He was confident that he understood that world better than the author who wrote it.
"Finding your footing."
The Disaster episode.
It was something he had already read a hundred times.
"The monster species has changed, but the scenario content has not. There will be a hidden piece that can activate the shield when the heat phase begins."
Poisonous lesser dragon.
It was a disaster that was well within the expected range.
"It’s over there."
Literature Girl 64 Ja Yerin found a foothold.
As the group stood on the scaffolding side by side, a series of messages appeared before their eyes.
<!>[Hidden piece is activated.]
<!>[Numerical steps are activated.]
<!>[If the right number of people enters the platform, 'Absolute Shield' can be activated for 10 people.]
<!>[When the number of people below or exceeding the number is on the scaffolding, the 'Absolute Shield' does not activate.]
The foothold the group found was '5'
Killer King looked at his companions.
'It’s me, Yerin, Lee Dansu, Shin Yoosoung. There are a total of five, including Cheon Inho, who fainted.'
The scaffolding soon turned green.
<!>['Absolute Shield' can be activated.]
In the distance, he could see the Avatars struggling to find their footing. Some of them even had flower buds blooming on the ground.
"What is this-"
Even before the incarnation finished speaking, the flower buds on the floor were in full bloom.
Killer King immediately activated his shield.
<!>[Activate Absolute Shield!]
<!>[Level 5 poisonous dragon species, Lesser Dragon Poisoner uses 'Death’s Hianflower'.]
A bunch of wildflowers in full bloom all at once. The green spores spread in an instant, leaving no trace of the labyrinth.
Flower buds sprouted from the spore-covered skin of the incarnations, and the dragon quickly shrunk.
"Keuyeok."
The mummified incarnations passed away one by one.
The spores of the wildflowers grown as fertilizer invaded the area.
The only safe place was where Absolute Shield was activated.
<!>[The 'Absolute Shield' is released.]
<!>['The Hianhwa of Death' disappears.]
In the empty space where the spores disappeared, the stems of dead plants and the incarnations that became corpses rolled around.
With a single attack, all the incarnations except them died.
It was a terrifying attack, but it could be easily avoided if he knew the pattern.
It was an attack.
The problem is that the 'number stepping stone' cannot be luckily matched forever.
The subtle smile of the intermediate dokkaebi floating in the air was the evidence.
If the number step '5' does not appear again next time, a casualty among the party members will arise.
<!>[After 1 minute, the position of the footrest will be regenerated.]
In other words, they had to see the outcome before the next 'Annihilation' began.
"Jophiel."
<!>[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' looks at his incarnation.]
"Is it still possible to sponsor relics?"
<!>[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' replies that your rank is not yet sufficient.]
"In that case, I would like to receive divine protection and support."
<!>[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' demands payment.]
"I will hand over half of the shares of 'King’s Tale' that I will acquire for the first time to <Eden>."
<!>[Constellation 'The Commander of the Red Cosmos' accepts.]
<!>[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' grants 'Valkyrie’s Protection'.]
Valkyrie's protection.
<!>[Valkyrie's protection has been temporarily activated.]
<!>[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' adds that this protection can only be used in the beginning scenarios.]
Killer King felt a faint warmth spreading throughout his body.
An unmistakable 'fire attribute' buff.
He immediately took out a bright blue bead from his chest.
"I will exchange this for 'Red Wreaths'. You can use the exchange or go through 'Dokkaebi Bag'. As soon as possible. I will pay the fee."
As he took a breather in the center of the clearing, a poisonous dragon species looked back.
<!>[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' accepts the incarnation’s request.]
<!>[5 items, Red Wreaths have been acquired!]
The poisonous dragon's tail, spinning brightly, swung towards them.
Killer King ran with his companions and threw the wreaths at his sister.
"Yerin!"
The key to this operation was his younger sister, Ja Yerin.
Ja Yerin immediately swallowed the wreaths. At the same time, a faint flame began to glow throughout her body.
She frowned slightly.
She ate as many as five pieces of red wreath, so his sister’s stomach must be boiling like hell.
"40 seconds," said Yerin.
This means that the limit time for dissipating heat through [fire resistance] is 40 seconds.
Killer King looked back at Lee Dansu.
"Now."
Lee Dansu, who was running on the right, nodded his head and pointed at the wall of the maze.
At the same time, black dots began to gather from somewhere around the bag.
The wheels were nothing special.
A swarm of cockroaches flew up like dust and stuck to the head of the poisonous dragon.
As if it was annoyed, the poisonous dragon sprayed radial breath into the air, and the bugs that were blocking its view melted away helplessly. The moment when the poisonous dragon snorted triumphantly and roared once again.
A white light flashed before his eyes.
The sharp claw tore off one of the poisonous dragon's eyes. It was Yerin's white and blue flag filled with the flames of a red wreath.
It was an effective blow, but it wasn't enough to defeat the dragon.
In the main story, Kim Dokja received the help of the master of Unbreakable Faith in order to defeat the disaster.
The castle effect and Holy Soul [Song of the Sword] were activated.
However, for Ja Yerin, there was neither a 'Unbreakable Faith' nor a [Song of the Sword].
'This is [Valkyrie's remorse] that I received to replace it.'
As Killer King stretched out his hand towards his sister, the effect of the blessings flowing from his body transferred to Ja Yerin.
It was the effect of [Heartless], a dedicated skill that allows them to share buffs with each other.
<!>[Baekjeonggi, Valkyrie's Protection, and even the supernormal ability of 'Red Wreath'.]
Nevertheless, the attack power was still insufficient.
Even if it were Kim Dokja who was here, this combination alone would not be able to ward off disaster.
However, the person who was there was not Kim Dokja.
"Go, Yerin."
His younger sister, Ja Yerin, is different from Kim Dokja. Unlike Kim Dokja, who was not talented in skills, Ja Yerin was full of talent.
The mastery of the skills she learned rose quickly, and her overall ability level was higher than that of Kim Dokja.
<!>[Incarnation 'Lee Seyeon' activates Skill 'Battle Action Mode'!]
A controller appeared in front of Killer King.
Memories of daycare came to mind. Memories of fighting with kids over the controller to play a game.
Killer King won the fight and held this controller longer than anyone else.
"Dark Spinning Breaker."
<!>[The advanced command was successfully activated!]
Ja Yerin's claws, burning dark red, quickly fertilized the entire body of the poisonous dragon.
Quad deud deuk!
The poisonous dragon's thick carapace could not withstand Ja Yerin's attack strengthened by [Battle Action Mode].
<!>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is amazed by the wit of the incarnations!]
<!>[The constellation 'The Prisoner of the Golden Headband' admires the power of the incarnation 'Lee Seyeon'.]
<!>[A few constellations are donating 500 coins to incarnation Lee Seyeon!]
Exclamations of constellations erupted from everywhere. Killer King watched his sister's actions while holding the heated controller.
Just a little more, just a little more—
And.
<!>[The fighting action mode is canceled.]
<!>[Overall review: Linkage score 91 points! Are you an aspiring professional gamer?]
Finally, the fighting action mode was released and Ja Yerin's movements became sluggish.
Then, the large body of the poisonous dragon species collapsed to the floor.
Joy went up his spine. He did it. His operation was successful.
However.
Purr.
The next moment, the venomous dragon species suddenly stood up and started devouring the surrounding plant corpses.
He had a feeling something was wrong.
'Why?'
Poisoner, a poisonous dragon species, should have died in the attack just now. Everything was under his calculation.
The poisonous dragon species that ate the flowers was recovering some vitality at the end of its death.
Killer King instinctively started running towards his sister.
"Yerin!"
Ja Yerin, who mustered all the magic of her body, moved once again. Although it was not as bad as when she activated [combat action mode], her claws were steadily accumulating blows to the poisonous dragon species.
However, the poisonous dragon roared into the air, not caring about the small wounds.
<!>[Level 5 poisonous dragon species 'Lesser Dragon Poisoner' prepares 'Bamboo Dragon’s Hianhwa'.]
Red flower buds were starting to appear on the tropical floor.
"Yerin! Come back!"
Ja Yerin did not stop her attacks. With her determination to defeat the poisonous dragon species without fail, she continued her attacks while staggering.
Killer King hugged his sister's waist and fell behind her.
Ja Yerin said, struggling.
"Let go"
Now, blood poured out of Yerin’s mouth. The flame of the red wreath had burned her insides.
Ja Yerin could no longer fight.
Killer King said this even though he knew that fact.
"You can kill him in the next phase. Just be patient. There’s still a chance."
Ja Yerin, who spit something out of her mouth, fell limply in his arms. Four undigested red wreaths fell to the floor with sparking flames.
Killer King thought as he picked up the red wreath.
His sister couldn't fight, but even the poisonous dragon species was now at its limit.
All he has to do is deliver the final blow.
He could probably do it on his own.
There are still Valkyrie's relics and red wreaths.
He just has to endure it this one time.
<!>[Numerical scaffolding is created.]
Luckily, a platform was created nearby.
Killer King immediately checked the number on the footrest.
And he froze in his place in a daze.
4.
There were no additional footholds anywhere to be seen.
Killer King looked at the faces of the remaining people. Cheon Inho was collapsed, Shin Yoosoung was taking care of him, and…
"Brother."
His staggering sister shook her head. As if she knew what he was thinking.
Killer King laid Ja Yerin down and then slowly stood up.
"Oppa, please."
"It’s okay."
Killer King looked back at the poisonous dragon species.
The flower buds on the floor were increasing. The attack would begin soon.
The floor covering had not been activated yet.
What was the problem? Was it because his strategy was sloppy? Or was there a sentence he couldn't read? The number on the step is 4. And the number of people left now is 5.
'I am.'
Kim Dokja would have moved forward without hesitation.
But Killer King did not give up easily. Why? He knows even without asking.
'Because he is not Kim Dokja.'
A field of wildflowers filled the floor.
"Brother."
He wanted to become Yoo Jonghyuk, he thought like that. He wanted to become a reader. The moment he took a step forward, he thought like that.
<!>[Numerical footpad is activated.]
The scaffolding turned green.
<!>[You can activate 'Absolute Shield'.]
He didn't know what had happened. He was still in the scaffolding.
Nevertheless, the scaffolding was activated. That means.
<!>[Someone other than him became Kim Dokja.]
When he raised his head, he saw the face of a blind man.
He was probably the person who was the furthest from Kim Dokja here.
A man who always wandered around looking for his daughter, and who only read 'Omniscient Reader' once.
"Don’t feel guilty."
Killer King could tell what he was thinking.
Lee Dansu had already lost his eyesight, and his body was almost destroyed. Even if he uses the 'Spirit of Elaine Forest', his body will not recover.
"I have nothing to lose now."
Killer King was unable to catch Lee Dansu, who was walking sloppily.
Lee Dansu’s choice was right.
Everyone except him were talented people who were absolutely necessary to see the end of this damned world.
With nothing to lose, it was right for him to go.
'But, if it were Kim Dokja, he might have said this.'
At that moment, a thought crossed Killer King’s mind.
His eyes gave off a dazzling light.
<!>[Eyes of sin.]
Jophiel's Stigmata. Killer King, who measures the 'sin karma' of all incarnations, was momentarily dazed after checking Lee Dansu's soul.
A pure white soul, as if it were wearing a white coat. Killer King had never seen such a soul before.
'One thing, there might be a way for him to live!'
But Killer King couldn't immediately think of the method.
It was natural. Because it was a sentence that had not been written yet.
It was the writer's job, not the reader's, to write the next sentence.
<!>[Stage 3 of 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is being activated.]
So, me.
"The scenario isn’t over yet!"
I thought as I looked at the man named Dansu walking towards the poisonous dragon.
There is a way for no one to die.
But if I use this method.
<!>[Level 5 poisonous dragon species, Lesser Dragon Poisoner, uses 'Death’s Blood'.]
Lee Dansu must die 'once'.
