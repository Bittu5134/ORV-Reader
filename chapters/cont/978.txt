<title>978 Episode 58 Mythical Constellation (10)
Asmodeus's eyes were etched with pure disbelief. The white arrow of the divine being, still buried in his chest, pulsed with a blinding radiance as it unleashed its intended authority.
<!>[The effect of the sacred relic, 'Ten Fingers of God', is activated!]
The strike was an undeniable success. Yet, seeing Asmodeus’s bewildered expression and hearing the tremor in his voice, a cold sense of foreboding washed over me.
<#>【How could this... happen...】
It was Asmodeus. Could that twisted Demon King, the architect of the Cinema and a veteran of the records, truly have been caught so completely off guard?
<#>【...Did you truly expect me to say that?】
I knew it. Asmodeus glanced toward Hou Yi, who was watching from the horizon, before shifting his gaze back to me.
<#>【I commend the effort. Using the Emperor's arrow to sever my tether... it was a quintessentially Kim Dokja-like strategy.】
<@>[I'll take the compliment, but it isn't what I'm looking for right now.]
Asmodeus’s entire presence began to vibrate with a sinister frequency. Despite the arrow piercing his origin, he showed no sign of agony. Instead, he gripped the shaft with a steady hand, his eyes locking onto mine with an intense, predatory focus.
<#>【However, this is not enough to stop the record.】
<!>[The constellations of the nebula, <Emperor>, are astonished by the resilience of the Great Recorder!]
I was reminded once more why he was the 'Recorder of Fear'. Even other recorders trembled at his name.
<#>【Borrowing the power of others will never bring you the conclusion you crave.】
His words weren't even imbued with [Incite], yet each one felt like an arrow of its own, piercing through my mental defenses.
<#>【If you truly wish to be Kim Dokja, you must not hesitate. You must learn to interpret, destroy, and deny the world with a violence greater than anything you have read.】
For a moment, his face looked strangely mournful. Beneath the mocking facade, I sensed a simmering, ancient rage. Just as my own emotions were inextricably tied to Kim Dokja’s, Asmodeus held a chaotic mass of feelings within him that had never been fully recorded—a melting pot of unwritten grief.
The sentences overflowing from his status began to suppress the light of Di Ku.
<&>「The one who had stepped beyond the boundaries of history to conquer death itself stood before me.」
Even I had to admire his sheer tenacity. If even the Emperor's arrows couldn't subdue him, what options were left? Would I truly have to face the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon in a fight to the death? Could I even pull off the 'Great King of Fear' form in my current state?
<#>【Even if it were me. In the end, you—】
Asmodeus’s voice faltered. A faint sound echoed through the achromatic field.
<&>「...」
It was thin, like the buzzing of an insect or the distant chirp of a bird. No. As I listened closer, the sound took on a heart-wrenching clarity.
<&>「...」
It was the cry of a child. Asmodeus’s brow furrowed as he glared into the empty air.
<#>【Are you truly trying to interrupt me now?】
<&>「...」
<#>【Even you... at a time like this...】
<&>「...」
Who was he talking to? His expression shifted rapidly—from anger to frustration, and finally, to a weary resignation.
A strange premonition gripped me. Was he actually talking to that being?
<#>【Yes, I understand. Enough. Silence.】
<&>「...」
<#>【I couldn't help it. Even a recorder has a heart. Especially the incarnation body of that dragon, whom I once...】
The murmur echoed one last time, and Asmodeus let out a heavy, defeated sigh.
<#>【Fine. I will leave the Black Dragon behind. I have no choice.】
Asmodeus’s incarnation body began to blur, losing its definition. He was voluntarily withdrawing from the stage.
<!>[The Recorder of Fear, 'Demon King of the Cinema', has suffered a critical blow and is exiting the scenario!]
<!>[The Recorder of Fear, 'Demon King of the Cinema', has redacted his own records, mitigating some of the penalty!]
<!>[The effect of the 'Ten Fingers of God' temporarily severs the contract between the Recorder and the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon!]
I reached out as he faded.
<@>[Asmodeus!]
His inscription manifested before my eyes one last time.
<&>「Asmodeus offered a leisurely smile, as if delivering the perfect exit line for a villain.」
<#>【Kim Dokja, do not let this myth-grade status go to your head. Your true enemy is already orchestrating the end of this world, far beyond your reach.】
<!>[...]
<#>【Fight to the bitter end with that masterful tongue of yours. I truly wonder... what sentence will eventually mark your death?】
He vanished completely, leaving only a faint afterimage that slipped through my fingers.
<#>【I leave the Black Flame Dragon in your care—for the time being.】
The moment he disappeared, a deluge of messages erupted in my mind.
<!>[Your monumental achievements resonate across the <Star Stream>!]
<!>[You have acquired a new 'Mythical Story'!]
<!>[The Administration Bureau is deeply moved by your rapid growth!]
<!>[Several Great Dokkaebis have requested a 'Private Meeting' with you!]
<!>[Various nebulae invite you to participate in the 'Context of the Constellation'!]
<!>[The Recorders of Fear are searching the 'Records Archive' for your history!]
<!>[You have been granted a temporary 'Recording Contract'!]
<!>[You are now the acting Recorder for the constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon'!]
<&>「Yes. You are finally coming.」
I must have lost consciousness for a few minutes. When the world finally stopped spinning, I felt someone roughly shaking my shoulder.
"Kim Dokja!"
Anna Croft's face was ashen. She was gripping my shoulder with enough force to crack the bone.
"It... it hurts, Anna."
"Are you awake?"
"Yes. I'm fine. Mostly."
I gently pried her hand away. My shoulder felt like it had been through a hydraulic press. Anna supported my weight as I tried to steady my breathing.
"Are you certain you're alright?"
"Yeah. What about Asmodeus?"
"Asmodeus?"
I realized she didn't know his true name. In this worldline, he was only known by the title 'Demon King of the Cinema'. I didn't have the energy to explain the complex history of the 1,864th round.
"What about the Black Flame Dragon?"
Anna pointed toward the ground. There, curled into a defensive posture, lay the pitch-black form of the dragon.
<!>[The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon's complete descent has been terminated.]
With Asmodeus's probability withdrawn, the dragon had lost its anchor. It was dispersing slowly, its presence no longer justified by the scenario's rules.
<!>[The constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is looking at you.]
I felt a strange, hollow longing in that message. I couldn't tell which version of him was looking at me—the one from the 41st round or the one I remembered—but the goodwill was unmistakable.
"Dokja-ssi!"
Jung Heewon had emerged from the 'Exposed Bush' and was rushing toward us. She checked my face with frantic eyes.
"Are you okay? Where are you hurt?"
"I'm fine, Heewon-ssi. Are you safe?"
"I'm alright. But... how did you do it? That dragon looked like it was going to destroy the world, but the moment you stood in its way, it just... stopped."
<!>[Several constellations wish to hear the details of your feat!]
I couldn't exactly explain that I’d just had a high-stakes debate with a primal demon king.
"I just held his attention for a while. A staring contest, you could say."
<!>[Some constellations are moved by your indomitable spirit!]
<!>[You have acquired a new story!]
<!>[You have acquired the mythical story, 'Adversary of the Dragon'!]
<!>[You have acquired the legendary story, 'Master of the Staring Contest'!]
'Adversary of the Dragon' was a rare prize, usually reserved for those who survived the Apocalypse scenarios. The staring contest one was... well, a bonus.
But the peace didn't last.
"Kim Dokja!"
Anna Croft’s voice was sharp with warning. I turned to see the surrounding constellations closing in. These were the hunters of the various nebulae who had been lurking, waiting for the myths to exhaust each other.
<&>「To stop the dragon, I had effectively summoned every predator in the region to my location.」
The real battle was only just beginning. Every star here wanted a piece of a Myth-grade target. The first to step forward were the Narrative-grade stalkers from <Papyrus>.
<!>[The constellation, 'Black Wolf Reaper', unleashes its status!]
The air grew thick with aggression, but the constellations held back, eyeing each other warily. No one wanted to be the first to draw the 'Demon King of Salvation's' ire.
<@>[Demon King of Salvation.]
It was Anubis, the Black Wolf Reaper, who spoke first.
<@>[I have come to collect you. Join <Papyrus>.]
The arrogance was staggering. Even Olympus had learned to tread carefully around me.
"And if I decline?"
I still held the status of my 'Demon King' form. I wasn't about to bow to a wolf just because he was baring his teeth. Anubis didn't seem surprised.
<@>[You are free to refuse, of course.]
His eyes shifted away from me, settling on Jung Heewon and Anna Croft. Both women tensed instantly. Anubis hadn't given up; he had simply changed his leverage.
<@>[However, <Papyrus> will remember this decision. We have a very long memory.]
I felt a cold smile touch my lips. It wasn't exactly a subtle threat. I gripped my scepter, weighing my options. I was outnumbered, and my stories were fraying.
<&>「Can I protect them both if I unleash the 'Great King of Fear' now?」
I was prepared to pay the price, but then—
<@>[Step back, Anubis.]
A giant wreathed in light stepped between us.
<!>[An announcement is issued to all constellations present!]
Mitra, despite his tattered wings and broken status, stood as a shield before me.
<@>[If you lay a hand on the Demon King of Salvation, you will answer to me.]
He was still a Myth-grade constellation. There wasn't a Narrative-grade being on the field willing to gamble their life against him. Anubis snarled, his teeth clicking together.
<@>[We withdraw.]
As the <Papyrus> forces retreated into the shadows, the other constellations followed suit. They had realized that, for today, I was untouchable. Mitra turned back to me once the field was clear.
<@>[Demon King of Salvation.]
I faced him, my guard still up. He was a constellation of <Veda>, after all. They were just as greedy as the rest. But instead of an attack, the massive entity slowly lowered himself onto one knee.
<@>[I offer my sincere respects to you.]
The staff of the Golden Dice Hall followed his lead, prostrating themselves in the dirt.
<!>[The constellation, 'Lord of December 25th', pays its respects!]
<!>[The constellations of the Golden Dice Hall offer their tribute!]
It was a surreal sight. The records of the 'Unchanging One' flickered in my mind. This was the moment—the formal recognition of the 'Demon King of Salvation' as a true Myth-grade existence by the Master of Valhalla.
My heart hammered in my chest. I felt a tectonic shift in the rules of my reality.
<&>「This universe is nothing more than a game of dice played by the gods.」
The world felt suddenly distant, a dizzying sensation pulling at my soul, much like when I had first ascended.
<&>「And in that great game, he has finally earned his own dice.」
<!>[You have earned the right to participate in the 'Round Table of Myths'!]
