<title>978 Episode 58 Mythical Constellation (10)
Asmodeus's eyes were filled with disbelief at what had just happened. The arrow of the divine being, piercing his heart, emitted a white light and unleashed its power.
<!>[The effect of the sacred relic, 'God's Ten Fingers', is activated!]
The operation was clearly a success. But why? Seeing Asmodeus's bewildered expression and hearing his voice, a strange feeling arose.
<#>【How could this happen…】
It was none other than Asmodeus. Could that mad demon king, who even owns a movie theater, have truly not prepared for this situation?
<#>【...Did you expect me to say that?】
As expected.
Asmodeus glanced at the Sun Hunter, who was watching from afar, and then spoke to me.
<#>【I commend you for using the arrow of the divine being. Shall we say it was truly a Kim Dokja-like strategy?】
<!>[Thank you, but that's not what I want to hear from you.]
Asmodeus's entire being was pulsating with a strange sense of foreboding. Even after being struck by Jegok's arrow, Asmodeus held onto the shaft of the arrow, showing no sign of pain. He stared at me, his gaze fixed on the shaft.
<#>【However, this isn't enough.】
<!>[The constellations of the nebula, <Emperor>, are astonished by the power of the great recorder!]
I remembered anew that he was a 'Recorder of Fear', feared by other recorders.
<#>【Borrowing the power of others won't get you to the end you desire.】
His words weren't even filled with [Incite], but every word he spoke felt like an arrow piercing through me.
<#>【If you truly want to become Kim Dokja, you must not hesitate. You will have to interpret, destroy, deny, and rewrite everything you've read with even greater violence.】
Why? Asmodeus's face looked strangely sad as he spoke. At the same time, I felt as if he was consumed by a deep rage.
Just as long-simmering emotions fuse within a single being, I wondered if there might be a melting pot of emotions within Asmodeus. Just as I cannot separate my own emotions from Kim Dokja's, there was a mass of emotions within him that was not fully recorded.
The sentences overflowing from his entire being were suppressing the power of the Jegok.
<&>「The one who had crossed the bounds of history and conquered even death stood before me now.」
Honestly, this time, even I couldn't help but admire the pure power of the Jegok.
What if even Jegok's arrows couldn't subdue him? Would I ultimately have to defeat the Black Flame Dragon?
But could I, at this point, do it?
If I were to fulfill all the stories of the 'Demon King of Salvation' and unleash the power of the 'Great King of Fear'—
<#>【Even if it were myself. In the end, you—】
The moment my expression hardened, my face still tense, a faint voice came from somewhere.
<&>「...」
It sounded like a flying insect, or a magpie chirping. No. Listening closely, it sounded exactly like—
<&>「.…..」
The cry of a child.
Asmodeus frowned slightly, glared into the air, and muttered softly.
<#>【Are you trying to interrupt me?】
<&>「...」
<#>【Even you, this time…】
<&>「...」
Who on earth was he talking to? Asmodeus's expression was changing in real time.
For a moment, a strange premonition crossed my mind. Could it be that he was talking to that guy right now—
<#>【Yes, I understand, so stop talking.】
<&>「...」
<#>【I couldn't help it. Even the recorder has feelings. Especially the Black Flame Dragon's incarnation body, whom I once…】
A murmur echoed through the air once more, and Asmodeus let out a deep sigh. And then something surprising happened.
<#>【Yes, I'll leave the Black Dragon behind. I can't help it.】
Asmodeus's incarnation body, which had been formed, began to blur. He was meekly exiting the scenario.
<!>[The Recorder of Fear, 'Demon King of the Cinema', has suffered a massive blow and is exiting the scenario!]
<!>[The Recorder of Fear, 'Demon King of the Cinema', has erased his own records, reducing some of the penalty!]
<!>[The effect of the relic, 'Ten Fingers of God', temporarily cancels the record contract between the Recorder, 'Demon King of the Cinema', and the constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon'!]
I reached out to Asmodeus.
<@>[Asmodeus.]
Then, Asmodeus's inscription unfolded before my eyes.
<&>「Asmodeus, with a leisurely smile, spoke. As if this were the perfect line for a villain's exit.」
<#>【Kim Dokja, don't be so arrogant just because you've reached myth-grade. Your arch-enemy is already plotting the end of this world, far beyond your reach.】
<!>[…]
<#>【Please, fight to the end with your masterful tongue. I wonder. What will be the sentence that will mark your end…】
Asmodeus's figure vanished, and all that my fingertips could grasp was a faint afterimage of the creature.
<#>【I will leave the Black Flame Dragon to you 'for the time being'.】
With those words, an explosive message rang in my ears.
<!>[Your amazing achievements resonate far and wide in the <Star Stream>!]
<!>[You have acquired a new 'Mythical Story'!]
<!>[The Administration Bureau is truly impressed by your growth.]
<!>[Some Great Dokkaebis have requested a 'private meeting' with you!]
<!>[Some nebulae invite you to the 'Context of the Constellation'.]
<!>[The Recorders of Fear are searching for your records in the 'Records Archive'.]
<!>[The Recorders of Fear are waiting for you in the 'Records Archive'.]
Amidst the explosion of messages that felt like my head was about to explode, the last message I recognized was this:
<!>[You have temporarily been given the 'Recording Contract'!]
<!>[You are now the Recorder of the constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon'.]
***
<&>「Yes, you are coming.」
***
I felt like I lost consciousness for a moment. A minute, or maybe two? When I regained consciousness, as if a fuse had blown in my head, someone shook my shoulder.
"Kim End-ssi."
Anna Croft, her face pale, clutched my shoulder, almost crushing it. Was this person stronger than me?
"It hurts."
"Are you awake?"
"Yes. I'm fine."
She had held on so tightly, it felt like my shoulder had been completely crushed.
I carefully pulled her hand away, and Anna Croft supported me.
"Are you sure you're okay?"
"Yes, and what about Asmodeus?"
"Asmodeus?"
Come to think of it, it seemed Anna Croft might not even know he was Asmodeus. After all, in this worldline, he was known as a Recorder, known by the pseudonym 'Demon King of the Cinema'.
I gave up on explaining and asked a different question.
"What happened to the Black Flame Dragon?"
Instead of answering, Anna Croft stared at the floor in the distance. There, curled up, was the pitch-black incarnation body of the Black Flame Dragon.
<!>[The constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon's', complete descent is lifted.]
The black dragon slowly dispersed. With the recorder's probability gone, it too lost its justification for remaining in the scenario. The very fact that the black flame dragon had descended into this scenario was proof that it wasn't of its own free will.
<!>[The constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is looking at you.]
I felt an inexplicable longing in the message. I couldn't tell if he was the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' I remembered, or the 'Abyssal' Black Flame Dragon' from the 41st round. However, he clearly harbored goodwill toward me.
"Dokja-ssi."
Jung Heewon, who had escaped from the 'Exposed Bush', was standing beside me. She fidgeted, examining my face, and asked,
"Are you okay? Are you hurt?"
"I'm okay. How are you, Heewon-ssi?"
"I'm okay."
True, my head was a bit dizzy, but it was a small price to pay for facing Asmodeus and the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon.
"How on earth did you do it? That mad dragon looked ready to attack, but when you, Dokja-ssi, stood in his way, he suddenly froze."
<!>[A few constellations want to hear about your exploits!]
I see. Perhaps that's how it seemed to Jung Heewon. To even notice the Recorder's presence, you need the power to read [Fate].
I couldn't bring myself to say I stalled for time with a lengthy tongue-lashing with Asmodeus, so I gave a vague explanation.
"I just stalled for time with a little staring contest."
<!>[Some constellations admire your spirit!]
<!>[You've acquired a new story!]
<!>[You've acquired the mythical story, 'Dragon's Adversary'!]
<!>[You've acquired the legendary story, 'Master of the Staring Contest'!]
I was astonished by the ensuing list of stories. 'Dragon's Adversary' was originally a story only available to the constellations that survived the catastrophe of the 'Apocalypse'. Plus, the 'Staring Master' was a bonus. It was worth the effort to fight Asmodeus.
However, the situation wasn't over yet.
"Kim End-ssi!"
I turned around at the sound of Anna Croft's nervous voice, and the constellations stared at me as if they had been waiting. They were the Nebula constellations, who had been watching my confrontation with the Black Flame Dragon.
<&>「To defeat the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', I summoned all the constellations of the region.」
In a sense, the real battle was just beginning. Because all the constellations gathered here now wanted me.
The first to react were the narrative-grade constellations from <Papyrus>.
<!>[The constellation, 'Black Wolf Reaper', reveals its power.]
But the constellations only exuded threatening aggression, watching each other closely, unable to approach.
<!>[Demon King of Salvation.]
As expected, the first to speak was the Black Wolf Reaper, 'Anubis'.
<!>[I've come to get you. Come to Papyrus.]
How could he speak so arrogantly in this situation? Even Olympus had backed down, so I wondered what he was thinking. But then I thought about it: the envoy of Papyrus had acted like that too.
"What if I don't want to?"
I still had access to the 'Demon King of Salvation' story, so I wasn't in a position to give in just because they were hostile.
But Anubis, as if he had anticipated my reaction, responded calmly.
<@>[Of course, you are free to refuse.]
I thought Papyrus had finally come to his senses, but Jung Heewon and Anna Croft, who were beside me, flinched simultaneously. Upon closer inspection, I saw Anubis glaring at my companions. He had changed his target, revealing his true colors to my companions.
He had begun to bet.
<!>[However, <Papyrus> will definitely remember that decision.]
A bitter smile escaped my face. This wasn't an overt threat, was it?
I slowly took deep breaths and moved the scepter. The other side's forces were too great for me to handle alone.
<&>「If I unleash the power of the 'Demon King of Salvation' here, will I be able to protect my comrades?」
But I couldn't back down now. Just as I was about to consider unleashing the scepter of the 'Great King of Fear'—
<@>[Step back, Anubis.]
Surprisingly, someone stood in Anubis's way in my stead.
<!>[Announcement to all constellations, including <Papyrus>.]
Mitra, the master of December 25th, raised a gleaming giant and stood guard before me.
<@>[If you touch the 'Demon King of Salvation' here and now, you will have to face my true form.]
Even though he was defeated by the Black Flame Dragon and had both of his wings ripped off, he was still a myth-grade constellation. There was no narrative-grade constellation here willing to face him.
A moment of silence followed, and Anubis spoke.
<!>[Withdrawal.]
As Anubis, gritting his teeth in anger, retreated, the other constellations began to leave, one by one. They had at least acknowledged that they could not touch me here and now.
As the constellations retreated, Mitra slowly turned to me.
<!>[Demon King of Salvation.]
I breathed a sigh of relief and faced him. To be honest, I had somewhat expected Mitra to step forward.
However, as he too was a constellation from Veda, it was inevitable he would covet my power.
I feared he might betray me at any moment, but then I saw his massive form slowly kneel before me.
<@>[I offer my sincere respects to you.]
Following this, the other constellations escorting him also prostrated themselves before me.
<!>[The constellation, 'Master of December 25th', offers its respects to you.]
<@>[All the constellations in the Golden Dice Hall offer their sincere respects to you.]
It was an incredible sight.
Then, the record of the 'Unchanging One' flashed through my mind.
It was the moment when the 'Master of December 25th' acknowledged the 'Demon King of Salvation' as a full-fledged 'Mythical Constellation'.
My heart pounded. And in the next moment, I felt as if the very rules of the universe had been overturned.
<&>「This entire universe is nothing more than a game of dice played by the gods.」
I felt as if the world before my eyes had suddenly become distant, along with a dizzying sensation, just like when I had first ascended to the 'mythical' level.
<&>「In that great game, he too will have his own dice.」
Belatedly, I realized what had happened.
<!>[You have earned the right to participate in the 'Round Table of Myths'.]
