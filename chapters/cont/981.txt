<title>981 Episode 59 What Ending (2)
Jung Heewon was the first to speak.
"Huh?"
Jung Heewon leaped through the swirling black dragon smoke, shielding me, and then asked with a suspicious expression.
"Isn't… that him?"
I nodded. He clearly didn't look like the guy I knew. But where the black dragon's massive body had disappeared, it was undoubtedly 'Kim Namwoon'.
<&>「To be more precise, it was close to being 'Kim Namwoon'.」
No matter how I looked at him, he looked like a little boy, around ten years old. Yet, the child's face still held the nuance of the 'Kim Namwoon' that I and Jung Heewon remembered.
I quickly pushed through the smoke and carefully picked up Kim Namwoon, who was sprawled on the floor.
<&>「I've seen characters who have become 'kkomas' like you.」
The shattered Kim Dokja, and Secretive Plotter/Sneaking Schemer who overused plausibility, had also become kkomas. So, was Kim Namwoon in a similar situation?
Jung Heewon asked with a worried voice.
"What could have happened?"
"Perhaps he suffered the aftermath of the 'Black Flame Dragon''s summoning."
The 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' was now a constellation of mythical status. It would be impossible for any incarnation to even borrow his power, let alone summon him.
But Kim Namwoon performed a miracle, summoning the black dragon's massive form into his own body. It dawned on me that Kim Namwoon, the delusional demon, was a colleague of Yoo Joonghyuk, who had made it onto the 『Top 100 Strongest』.
"Ah."
Kim Namwoon slowly opened his eyes in my arms. Drenched in cold sweat, Kim Namwoon looked up from within my embrace and pursed his lips several times.
Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah.
I felt dizzy. What came out wasn't his own voice. The man's words, vomited from deep within his lungs, pierced me.
<&>「"I only follow the captain's orders. And you're not the captain."」
Kim Namwoon's voice, engulfed in a fierce [black flame], was followed by a detached reply that felt almost uneasy.
<&>「"Of course. You're not needed on 'that stage' anyway."」
The moment I heard his voice, my heart sank coldly.
'Snowfield Kim Dokja'.
It was unmistakable. This memory was of Kim Namwoon confronting 'Snowfield Kim Dokja'.
But I couldn't understand. Why had Kim Namwoon confronted my brother? And why had my brother said Kim Namwoon was 'unnecessary'?
<&>「What on earth is this 'stage' that Snowfield Kim Dokja speaks of?」
What I knew for certain was that 'Snowfield Kim Dokja' had contributed to Kim Namwoon's situation. It was one more reason to meet my brother.
"Dokja-ssi!"
The amount of stories flowing from Kim Namwoon was steadily increasing. As the stories overflowed violently, I could feel Kim Namwoon's body gradually shrinking. It was clear that if anything continued like this, Kim Namwoon would completely disintegrate and vanish from this world.
<&>「【I'll leave the Black Flame Dragon to you 'for the time being'.】」
Is that why Asmodeus said that? That bastard was actually planning to let me do the annoying work.
<!>[You are currently the recorder of the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon'.]
I took a deep breath and gathered Kim Namwoon's scattered stories.
Following stories possess inherent resilience, so if we can keep the shattered fragments from completely scattering, they can be restored.
The problem was how to keep the story fragments that had lost their cohesion from scattering.
<&>「It's okay.」
I began, speaking to Kim Namwoon as if I were talking to him. I could feel his shoulders tremble slightly as he became a child. Just because I say it's okay, this guy won't suddenly get better. I know that. All I can do now is briefly tell a different story to someone who's having terrible nightmares.
<&>「There's an ending to a universe.」
One effective way to maintain the unity of a story is to plant 'another story' to connect the scattered stories. By reconnecting the fragments of a broken story with another story, we create a central point for a larger story.
<&>「A story that can never be reached, so in some worlds, it's no different from a dream.」
I told Kim Namwoon the story of the 1,863rd round.
<&>「That's Han Sooyoung's story.」
I told this story because the 1,863rd round was the world line where 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' and 'Kim Namwoon, the water character' survived and saw the ending.
<!>[The constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is focusing on your records.]
The reason Kim Namwoon's current condition is so precarious is ultimately because the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is unstable.
In other words, if he could just grab the black dragon's attention, Kim Namwoon's chances of recovery would increase.
Indeed, as the narrative progressed, Kim Namwoon's condition began to improve rapidly. Color returned to his pale cheeks, and the scattered fragments of the narrative began to fall back into place.
<!>[The narrative of the 'character' in question is stabilizing.]
As expected. The 1,863rd round was about that 'Han Sooyoung'. Since Han Sooyoung's sponsor in the 1,864th round was the Black Flame Dragon, it was inevitable that he would be interested in Han Sooyoung's story.
Just as I was beginning to think I could stop recording, Kim Namwoon's lips parted once again. This time, it wasn't a moan or a scream. What he said was—
"Lee Jihye."
It was clearly someone's name. When I nodded, showing that I was listening, Kim Namwoon opened his mouth again, lips trembling.
"Save Jihye."
For a moment, my mind went blank. I hadn't expected to hear such words from anyone else, let alone Kim Namwoon.
<&>「That proud Kim Namwoon—that narrow-minded, delusional demon who relied on no one—was asking me for a favor.」
As if he thought I hadn't heard correctly, Kim Namwoon opened his mouth again.
"Save Yoosoung."
Have I ever seen Kim Namwoon ask for someone's help? Even after writing and reading so many sentences, I still don't understand this story. I felt a sense of bewilderment and a subtle elation at the same time.
<&>「The addition of just one line can change the landscape of a story.」
What kind of picture was my brother painting as the world line neared its conclusion? And why couldn't Kim Namwoon enter the landscape he was painting?
"I will."
I couldn't tell if the fainting Kim Namwoon had heard me.
"Definitely."
However, his closed eyes looked more serene than before.
Mitra, who had been observing the situation from afar, raised his massive body.
<!>[It seems we're ready.]
It was time to set out in search of the 'Missing Bush'.
***
To cut to the chase, the search for the 'Missing Bush' wasn't easy.
"I don't think it's here either."
Mitra had marked five locations for the 'Missing Bush'.
We had already failed in three of them.
"That map, isn't it actually defective?"
Mitra cleared his throat in response to my question.
<@>[Basically, 'bushes' appear randomly. Even if there's a pattern, it doesn't mean they'll always appear in that location. We've already confirmed three positions, so it's certain it will appear in one of the remaining two.]
As Mitra spoke, he led his massive body forward with his subordinates, his body swaying. Frankly, I was dissatisfied with the pace of their advance, but from my perspective, it was difficult to complain.
<&>「Right now, it's safer to move with Mitra.」
Even now, there were those chasing us from a few hundred meters away. They were probably remnants of Papyrus or another giant nebula.
Anna Croft, watching Mitra's sluggish gait, approached me and said,
"I think we're wasting our time."
"He's badly injured. His wings are all torn off."
"It's his wings, not his legs. Our advance is too slow. It feels like he's waiting for something."
Kim Anna, now as suspicious as a Korean, spoke. Jung Heewon, who was carrying Kim Namwoon on her back, also joined in.
"I agree. It was a sinister constellation to begin with."
I knew Mitra was listening, so I didn't make it a point to show it, but I wasn't entirely unaware of their suspicions.
Even if Mitra was a 'mythical constellation', this was a 'super-large battlefield'. With the power of the Round Table potentially intervening at any moment, and the potential for a variable like the 'Black Flame Dragon' to emerge, no matter how I looked at it, maintaining this pace of advance seemed to suggest some hidden agenda.
<!>[The 'Sanctuary' will appear soon!]
Just then, a message from the Sanctuary appeared.
Mitra's massive body, walking ahead, stopped. Several of the constellations escorting Mitra whispered something in low voices.
<&>「The Sanctuary.」
The Sanctuary was one of the key events of this 'super-large battlefield'.
<&>「When the Sanctuary appears, a five-minute timer will start. After the timer expires, all twenty participants standing beneath the light of the Sanctuary will be transferred to the 'Main Battlefield'.」
Only five minutes. If they could survive five minutes in the Sanctuary's event zone, they could proceed directly to the 'Main Battlefield'. For the constellations of Valhalla Hall, who had been forcibly dragged into the battlefield, this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
<@>[Many constellations are awaiting the appearance of the 'Sanctuary'!]
Even though Mitra was holding out, I could sense a surge in the number of constellations gathering in the surrounding area.
<@>[I intend to advance to the higher battlefield from here.]
The Sun Hunter seemed determined to seize this opportunity. While I felt a sense of regret, his goal was to find his transcendent friends, so it was only right to part ways.
"Thank you."
<@>[Be careful.]
Here, it was unclear what he was warning us to be careful about. However, for some reason, the Sun Hunter turned to Mitra. I too looked at him. Perhaps sensing our gaze, Mitra began to approach. The 'sanctuary' must have appeared. I thought I could finally hear Mitra's plan—
<@>[I found the Missing Bush.]
The unexpected news made me jump to my feet. I had finally found the 'Missing Bush'.
But Mitra's expression was unpleasant.
<@>[But I recommend not entering.]
"Why?"
<@>[The power of the 'Outer Deity' feels too strong.]
Outer Deity. Even though I had acquired the power of the 'Fear Realm', an 'Outer Deity' was still a burden.
Furthermore, if Mitra, a 'myth-grade constellation', could describe it as 'strong', then it wasn't just any outer deity. At the very least, a natural disaster.
In the worst case, there was a possibility that a being equivalent to the End-of-the-World was lingering within the bushes.
<&>「Perhaps there is a 'Great Old One'.」
If that level of foreign presence existed, even with the use of the 'Fear Realm', it wouldn’t be easy to counter.
But I couldn’t back down. The 'Missing Bush' was the only clue to finding Dansu ahjussi. I had to enter the bushes, no matter what.
"Where is the bush?"
As if waiting for my question, Mitra pointed somewhere. The moment I saw the tip of his finger, a vast compression occurred, centered around the vanishing point. This was likely Mitra’s vision. At the end of that compressed field of vision, the bush I was searching for was there.
<&>「The Missing Bush.」
The moment I confirmed the bush, I understood Mitra’s words. The immense narrative energy emanating from the bushes was so intense that I couldn’t help but shudder.
<&>「An outer god.」
The deity within that bush was clearly one I couldn't even dare confront.
And yet, for some reason, a chuckle escaped me.
"It doesn't matter. I'll go."
Mitra narrowed his eyes, as if questioning my sincerity.
As Mitra had said, what lay within that bush was, by this worldline's standards, an unmistakable 'outer deity'.
The reason I didn't hesitate was simple.
The 'outer deities' within that bush were people I knew very well.
<&>「<Kim Dokja Company> is within.」
