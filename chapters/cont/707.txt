<title>707 Episode 26 Star Ladder (3)
The 41st round was unlike any other round that had ever existed.
Because in this world, there was something called 'Kim Dokja Fragment'.
A piece that can evolve a Dark Sentinel into a higher monster species by collecting just one.
If you think about it, even Asmodeus, who evolved into an Outer God, was gathering 'Kim Dokja fragments'.
In such a situation, there was no way that the constellations of giant nebulas, who had better information than anyone else, would not know about Kim Dokja's fragments.
<@>[Is it you?]
The constellations that descended before my eyes were proof of that.
'I should have expected it!'
The situation is such that apostles are scattered in various countries and the intensity of filtering has decreased. The giant nebulas should have made their moves while being aware of 'Kim Dokja'.
But the situation was already bad.
They dug a trap to catch the 'Demon King of Salvation' and we were caught in it.
'Constellation-nim.'
—It's okay.
Even in the face of crisis, Kim Dokja remained calm.
<@>[You don't look as strong as I heard.]
<@>[The level of the incarnation is also poor.]
<@>[Is it really worth bringing in? I cannot understand the intentions of the mythical constellations.]
<@>[Don’t look at it. Still, it is the first fragment of the 'Oldest Dream'.]
<@>[Are you talking about the abolished god?]
Unlike the constellations in the sky, the constellations here talked carelessly.
This place is 'Ginnongagap'.
Is it because they know that no one records the story of this place and that no constellation except them can see this place?
Kim Dokja asked the arrogant constellations.
"Are you looking for me?"
Even in front of the ten constellations lined up, Kim Dokja was confident. As if he were certain that they alone could not do anything about him.
The constellations seemed both impressed and angry at Kim Dokja's attitude.
The constellations, who were twinkling as if radiating all their emotions, finally gathered their opinions and closed their mouths.
The first to step forward was 'Valkyrie’s Daughter'.
The constellation, wearing a winged helmet and plate armor decorated with alabaster metal, glared at Kim Dokja once, then smiled and spoke.
<@>[To be exact, you came to visit us.]
"I don’t remember looking for you."
<@>[We called you. I was curious whether the real 'Demon King of Salvation' would come.]
As expected, was this scenario a trap designed by <Asgard>?
"So what are your thoughts on seeing me?"
<@>[Come to us, 'Demon King of Salvation'.]
Valkyrie's daughter smiled seductively and beckoned. Kim Dokja asked, tilting his head with a crooked expression.
"What do you mean?"
<@>[It means that I will accept you as a constellation of <Asgard>.]
It was an unexpected suggestion.
An invitation from <Asgard>.
This has happened often in the main story, and I also received an invitation from <Asgard> right after hunting down the 'founder of the Absolute Throne'.
But it was not in the same form as it is now.
<!>[Nebula <Asgard> invites the constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' to join the nebula.]
<!>[There is no penalty of any kind for this request.]
Join the Nebula with no conditions.
Have they ever offered such unconventional conditions?
When I was asked to join, <Asgard> put forward an 'absolute command' as a condition for the next 200 years.
<@>[This is not everything. If you come to our nebula, we will also support your incarnation.]
Was it because of an unexpected suggestion? Kim Dokja did not answer right away and remained silent for a moment. The 'Valkyrie’s Daughter' probably thought the silence was a positive sign and continued speaking.
<@>[I will give you a privilege that no other incarnation has received before. You will also be able to share our legendary stories and relics. Then your incarnation will be able to climb these scenarios faster than anyone else.]
Asgard's legendary stories and relics.
If their proposal is true, as soon as I accept the proposal, I will be treated  better than 'Anna Croft'.
At that moment, I made eye contact with Anna Croft, who was looking at me from a few steps away. She was listening to this conversation with a confused look, as if she didn't know what was going on.
Kim Dokja briefly glanced at Anna and then asked again.
"If I just sign up, you’ll do it all for me?"
<@>[Yes]
"What kind of telecommunication company are you?"
<@>[News agency? What does that mean?]
"Can you swear by the name of 'One-Eyed Matreya'? You really won’t put any conditions on it?"
The constellations just looked at each other without answering. Then, one of the constellations belatedly took action.
<@>[How dare you mention my father’s name—]
"That doesn’t seem possible."
Kim Dokja lightly sneered.
"I don’t believe in unconditional favor. It’s obvious that there will be strange clauses attached. You Nebula people have always been like that."
I also had the same thoughts as Kim Dokja.
In the first place, there is no reason for ten people to come here out of pure kindness.
Finally, one of the constellations couldn't stand it anymore, frowned at him and stepped forward.
The one who had defended her father spoke up.
<@>[I won’t talk too much. Return the 'fragments' you have collected to <Asgard> immediately.]
<@>[One who washes cleanly. Step back!]
<@>[Daughter of the Valkyrie, we have no time to waste. 'Gingagap' doesn't last very long.]
Kim Dokja shrugged his shoulders and laughed.
"Look at this. How good is it that we can be honest with each other?"
Ten constellations looked this way at the same time.
<@>[I will ask you one last question. Are you going to join our nebula?]
"I’m sorry, but I’m already the representative of a certain nebula."
The moment I heard those words, my heart started beating without me knowing.
This is because the 'Demon King of Salvation' who spoke those words was like Kim Dokja from the story I remembered.
Perhaps the memories Kim Dokja recovered from the past were about <Kim Dokja Company>.
The noisy constellations frowned and said.
<@>[Which nebula did you join?]
"Kim Dokja's Company."
<@>[Such a nebula does not exist.]
As he said, there is no nebula called <Kim Dokja Company> in this world line. Maybe there won't be any in the future.
Then Kim Dokja said:
"Yes. Low-level guys like you wouldn’t know about them."
<@>[You...!]
As as many as ten constellations stared at me, I felt an enormous sense of pressure.
Gazes that have saved and killed countless incarnations so far.
But Kim Dokja did not feel intimidated at all.
If I thought about it, he had endured this kind of gaze all along. After the scenario began, maybe even before it began.
<@>[If you reject our offer, you will perish here. With your incarnation.]
"Can you do it with just you?"
Kim Dokja laughed darkly.
The monster that had grown by devouring the gaze of the stars was now glaring at them from the same spot as the stars.
Coo coo coo coo coo.
As an unusual current began to flow, the embarrassed constellations also expressed their anger in earnest.
I paid attention to the black hand of the 'cleaner' who was leading them.
'Constellation-nim, that black hand.'
Kim Dokja also seemed to remember that hand and nodded his head.
—That's right.
The hand that has retrieved the souls of readers whenever they have died.
A white scar remained on the back of the constellation's hand.
It was a wound I cut with my 'Unbreakable Faith'.
Hell, these guys are one of the criminals who kidnap the souls of readers whenever they die.
"Rather, I should make a suggestion. Give me all the 'Kim Dokja fragments' you have collected so far."
<@>[What?]
"Then, I will help you prevent Ragnarok from happening in this world line."
<@>[How dare you to <Asgard>—]
"You must speak clearly. You are not <Asgard>."
My body, possessed by Kim Dokja, slowly rose into the air.
<@>[ Way of the wind.]
Hair and coats were blowing violently in the wind, accompanied by fierce wind pressure.
"At most, you are only ten 'historical-grade constellations'."
<@>[It seems like you don't really understand what kind of situation you're in.]
In response to Kim Dokja's provocation, the constellations of <Asgard> continued to speak with a calmer tone.
<@>[I already know about you. You were quite a famous constellation in other world lines.]
<@>[But whoever you are, your story will not work here.]
<@>[Because this is a stage before the 'stories' have yet been written.]
In hindsight, I understood their leisure.
This is the stage of the beginning, 'Ginnongagap'. Kim Dokja's story does not show its true power here.
Nevertheless, Kim Dokja did not lose his composure.
"Okay?"
<@>[Capture him.]
Ten constellations flowed out at the same time and rushed towards Kim Dokja.
Kim Dokja looked at them and said.
"It looks like the constellations above have heard about my story, but it looks like no one has told you exactly what it is."
The person who claimed to be the leader is 'the one who washes cleanly'.
As soon as he held out his hand, wearing pitch-black gloves, dozens of shadow hands came rushing in.
"They don’t know either."
Beast King's Sensitivity protected me from the flying shadow hand, and at the same time, the disaster species released their breath from the Monster Gate that opened. It was the same tactic that had previously subdued the 'black beast'.
Coo coo coo coo!
But this time, the opponent is a 'constellation'.
From an incarnation’s point of view, Shin Yoosoung's monsters are strong, but from the stars' point of view, it is different.
<@>[Just like a monster!]
A constellation dressed as a Viking sent his ax flying towards the gate. The ax, loaded with fierce fighting power, created a gust of wind, blowing off the heads of the monsters and even tearing off the entrance to the gate.
Some of the frightened disaster species stuck out their necks and ran away in panic.
<@>[Give up your head!]
After all, a constellation is a constellation.
This was an enemy on a different level from the enemies I had fought so far.
So why am I not that nervous?
Is it because Kim Dokja is with me?
—Did you forget that we killed the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne'?
Memories of confronting the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne' at the end of the fourth scenario.
It was like that.
Come to think of it, I have already faced enemies stronger than them.
—You said that back then.
I still remember the events of that day vividly. The day I gained the Demon King of Salvation as a sponsor and came back from the dead.
The day Han Sooyoung disappeared.
—You are Kim Dokja.
That day, I swore to Han Sooyoung.
I accepted who I was.
'I think it should be so.'
But if I accept that, does that mean I become 'Kim Dokja'?
—It’s still not enough.
I was angry, but I had no choice but to admit it.
If he, and no one else, said so, it would be so.
'I know.'
I have an excuse.
Even if I am a part of Kim Dokja, I have not lived 'Kim Dokja’s life'.
I've written and read stories about him, but I really don't know what he was like.
​I don't know  him as a person. I do not know how he laughed, what tone of voice he spoke, or what thoughts he lived through the many lines that are not described.
In a way, I'm finally starting to understand it little by little.
—Youngest.
I am learning about Kim Dokja.
—I hope you survive.
It's still difficult.
—Remember. How does 'Kim Dokja' fight? See it clearly with your own two eyes and write it down.
Sometimes it's lonely, lonely, and difficult, so it's hard for me to do it alone.
<!>[The synchronization rate with your sponsor is increasing!]
At that moment, a scene unfolded in my mind.
It was a library.
As we moved on, Kim Dokja was standing beyond the swaying candela lights.
Kim Dokja quickly passed by the bookshelves, then stopped and took out a book from one of the shelves.
There were traces of Kim Dokja reading and rereading the pages he opened.
When I turned my head, Kim Dokja was looking at me.
—From now on, we will read together.
I nodded.
<!>[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]
Ten constellations attacked us at the same time.
A blade that shines pure white. Frozen Changgeuk. Arrows blazing with flames and shadowy hands piercing like awls.
I couldn't take on any of them on my own.
But it's different when we're together.
<!>[Bookmark 5 has been activated!]
<!>[Your current body composition is different from that of the character.]
<!>[Your 'strength' overcomes the physical condition penalty.]
I felt goosebumps deep inside my mind and an indescribable sense of liberation.
<&>「He is truly Kyrgios’s disciple.」
It's different from the time when all I could do was just barely imitate with [Incite].
<&>「The paradoxical White Blue, the successor to the vision of 'Kyrgios Roadgrim'.」
The magical power of white and blue, burning like a wildflower, dyed us blue.
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Electrification Lv.???' has been activated.]
Kim Dokja, who became a blue holy light, passed by the first line of constellations.
The constellation 'the Cleanser' who was standing in the first line, looked back at us with astonished eyes.
"If you really wanted to catch me."
Kim Dokja said without even looking at him.
"You should have brought at least a mythical-grade constellation."
The three constellations in the first row were split in half.
