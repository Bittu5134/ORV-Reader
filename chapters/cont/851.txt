<title>851 Episode 46 Big Joke (2)
The Constellations of the ark, who had received the emergency alarm, began to descend to the ground all at once.
<@>[Foolish guys.]
The first thing that caught my eye was the Great-grade Constellation at the forefront, shouting and swinging their greatsword.
It was a Constellation belonging to the Argo Expeditionary Force, the giant gate <Olympus>.
<@>[How dare you know where this is—]
That was the extent of the advice he was allowed to give. The Constellation’s incarnation was split in two by the sword of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.
The indignant Great-grade Constellations each radiated anger and fell to the ground like shooting stars.
"Shoot."
At the signal of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, the Transcendent Constellations lined up at the rear all aimed their bows at the sky.
<@>[Mortals!]
The Constellations that had been emitting their fierceness in the air along with the tiresome mortal rhetoric exploded in the sky.
Super strong mana.
A bundle of arrows with the stories of the Transcendents added, far superior to [Strong Mana]. The arrows of the Transcendents, who had already experienced countless wars like this, were accurate and sharp.
<@>[What the—]
The Constellations that descended confidently were hit by arrows before they could even set foot on the ground, and their fates were sealed.
The Constellations that were lucky enough to land were also unable to block the single sword of Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.
<@>[Kwaaaaah!]
Although they were Great-grade Constellations, they were Constellations that were considered great wherever they went. Those Constellations were being cut off by a single sword.
A few of the quick-witted Great-grade sensed something was wrong and lifted their bodies.
<@>[Where are you going?]
But the Twelve Gods, including Apollo, had already arrived there.
As Apollo lightly blew off the heads of the Great-grade Constellations that were running away, the Great-grade Constellations who changed their positions again shouted loudly.
<@>[The Twelve Gods have arrived!]
<@>[Everyone, wake up! The enemy is just an incarnation!]
But before their battle line could be fully formed, the order of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was given once again.
"Cut it."
"It's going to happen anyway."
Cheok Jungyeong stepped forward, grumbling. His entire body, which had taken a stance with his sword, began to condense a huge amount of fighting spirit.
The moment the Constellations, feeling a sense of crisis, were about to utter a warning.
One Sword Cuts Thousands.
The Constellations in the battle line were split in half. Literally cutting a thousand with one stroke, a flawless and perfect swordsmanship.
Although the opponents were Constellations, so he couldn't really cut a thousand, dozens of Constellations died with that one cut.
Some Constellations muttered in amazement at Cheok Jungyeong's incredible power.
<@>[I know, this is ridiculous...]
<@>[Get out of the way.]
In the end, the Twelve Gods who couldn't stand it anymore stepped forward. They also had an intuition. The humans in front of them had power that even the Narrative-grade Constellations couldn't look down on.
Apollo glared at Cheok Jungyeong and asked.
<@>[You must have been destroyed during 'The Last Dragon', so how did you come back?]
Cheok Jungyeong smirked and then showed off his hidden status without holding back.
<!>[The Constellation 'Goryeo's First Sword' reveals his status.]
Even the Narrative-grade Constellations' expressions hardened at the general-level aggression that was encroaching on the area. Cheok Jungyeong said.
<@>[I always wanted to test it. How strong is that great 'Olympus Twelve Gods' level?]
Cheok Jungyeong's whole body simultaneously swelled with the power of a Constellation and transcendence.
Third Captain of the Transcendent Alliance, Goryeo's best swordsman Cheok Jungyeong. With the strongest incarnation body in history, he was one of the few beings in this world who possessed the power of both a Constellation and transcendence.
Apollo said with a sullen voice.
<@>[Do you really have to fight with us? Aren't you a Constellation after all?]
<@>[You have to pay the price for making my only disciple suffer by using that Constellation's modifier.]
<@>[Disciple? Who are you talking about?]
<@>[A guy who makes dumplings well.]
Cheok Jungyeong jumped at that signal. Almost at the same time, a bright artificial sun rose behind Apollo's back. A blazing heat that would burn the earth swept over, but Cheok Jungyeong merely laughed as if it was ridiculous.
<@>[As rumored, you hang a toy on your head.]
<@>[What?]
<@>[It seems that you haven’t inherited the position of Sun God from Helios yet?]
Was that a reversal? The enraged Apollo let out a rippling corona. The flame of the corona was carried directly onto Apollo’s bow.
<@>[You arrogant bastard. I’ll burn you so you never come back to life.]
Apollo, aiming at the ground, released the bowstring. The arrows shot out with swirling flames soon scattered into hundreds and thousands of strands and struck the ground like lightning. The Transcendents who had been shooting the most powerful magic groaned and fell to the ground.
"Shoot again!"
But the Transcendents were persistent. Each and every one of them had entered 'transcendence' after intense training. They would not back down from such a small blow.
<@>[It’s annoying.]
Apollo snapped his fingers in the air, and a huge wall rose up around the ark.
<!>[The story, 'Walls of Troy', begins!]
It was once a wall built by Apollo and Poseidon to protect Troy.
The Transcendents groaned at the thickness of the wall, which could even repel the powerful Mashi with enormous destructive power.
"How could this—"
This was the history built by the Twelve Constellations.
Apollo’s sun, burning brightly above the wall, looked down on the bewildered humanity.
<@>[Foolish humans. You can’t win…]
<@>[That obvious threat pattern hasn’t changed for hundreds of years.]
Apollo stepped back in shock at the words of advice he heard right next to him.
When did it start? Cheok Jungyeong was standing right next to him.
<@>[Shut up!]
A furious Apollo once again let go of his bow.
As Cheok Jungyeong twisted his body slightly to avoid the fire, the artificial sun’s intense heat poured down onto the castle walls.
Cheok Jungyeong laughed.
<@>[This is the perfect toy to put in the introduction of that rich guy.]
Cheok Jungyeong’s three swords spit fire. From the two swords to the three swords. Cheok Jungyeong’s secret technique, which cut mountains and seas, split the castle walls and struck Apollo’s sun.
Kududududud!
The Great-grade Constellations caught in the aftermath screamed.
The artificial sun, split in half, lost its light as sparks flew.
Apollo, standing in front of the shattered artificial sun, muttered in vain with soot all over his body.
<@>[This is ridiculous… How could my sun…]
Apollo’s expression showed fear for the first time. He hurriedly turned around and shouted.
<@>[What are you all just watching? Hephaestus! Athena! Artemi—]
With a thud, Cheok Jungyeong’s sword pierced his heart.
Apollo’s incarnation collapsed.
At the same time, the Constellations waiting behind him, each with their own powers, rushed at Cheok Jungyeong.
<!>[The Constellation, 'Speaker of Justice and Wisdom', reveals her own status!]
<!>[The Constellation, 'Blacksmith of the Volcano', reveals his own status!]
<!>[The Constellation, 'Pure Moonlight Hunter', reveals her own status!]
Three Constellations of Olympus… He deflected Artemis’ arrows, blocked Hephaestus’s hammer, and aimed for Athena’s Aegis whenever he saw an opening.
The Constellations gaped in frustration at the fierceness of Cheok Jungyeong, who fought fiercely against three of the Twelve Divine seats.
At that moment, a Constellation appeared at the end of the broken Trojan walls. The air in the area changed slightly, and a lightning-like spell struck the battlefield.
<@>[Olympus is in a terrible state.]
The moment the spell fell, the expressions of the Constellations and Transcendents changed. The faces of the Constellations turned gray, and the faces of the Transcendents became covered in darkness. It couldn’t be otherwise. The Constellations that had just appeared were beings who could change the atmosphere of this battlefield.
If there were Twelve Divine seats in <Olympus>, there were Eight Locapalas in <Vedas>. The only 'Lokapala' who survived until the final scenario, and the only Constellation that claims to be the strongest among them.
<@>[Children of <Olympus>. Do you need this body's help?]
Indra, the 'God King of Thunder'
Except for the Three Gods of <Vedas>, the most powerful being had just appeared at the entrance of the ark.
Indra, who had been laughing lightly with both arms spread out, landed on the bottom of the wall and asked.
<@>[Is there a human who dares to face me?]
He was confident that there would be no being who could face the God King of Thunder, not even another Constellation.
However, there was a Transcendent that had been waiting for him to come forward.
Indra looked at the Transcendent that was the size of a fist in front of him.
<@>[What is this little rat?]
However, when that little rat pulled out his sword, Indra was unconsciously taking a battle stance. Indra frowned in surprise.
'This body is tense?'
The smallest Transcendent in the world. He thought he had heard that name somewhere.
A dwarf from a remote planet who goes around talking crazy about how the smallest things are the greatest.
<@>[Is that so, you.]
Second Captain of the Transcendent Alliance, Kyrgios Rodgraim, the Paradoxical White-Blue.
"Let's get started right away."
As soon as he finished speaking, the two beings' bodies disappeared. For a moment, it seemed as if everything had been turned into a vacuum, and all sounds disappeared, before a terrifying thunderbolt exploded in the air. A storm of lightning that raged on without stopping.
Every time Kyrgios' [All-in-One] and Indra's [Thunderstorm] collided, the scenery of the night sky changed.
<!>[The Constellation, 'God of Thunderbolt', activates the stigma 'Eye that Watches Over All'!]
The Constellations let out a gasp of astonishment.
The [Eye that Watches Over All]. It was the stigma that Indra used when he drew out his true power.
<@>[Is Indra serious about that small Transcendent?]
A thousand eyes opened one by one on Indra's entire body, which had swelled up in the sky.
According to mythology, the moment all of his thousand eyes opened, Indra's incarnation could fully use the power of his true body.
It would have been suicide to give Indra time to fully manifest his power now.
However, Kyrgios waited for Indra. Indra let out a strange laugh as if he had noticed Kyrgios' feelings.
<@>[You arrogant bastard. Do you really want to fight me?]
A thousand eyes glowed on Indra's entire body. The sacred relic, the Vajra, he had taken out spun around violently, and a [Heavenly Thunderstorm] of a different scale than before poured down. A blow that could completely destroy the surface of any planet and turn the entire area into an ocean.
In the face of that overwhelming thunder, Kyrgios stood alone.
"From the perspective of the universe, it was just a dusty incident."
With a calm voice, Kyrgios's stigma, the 'Pure White Paradox', let out a loud cry.
Baekcheong-mun.
Visionary art.
It was a technique that Kyrgios had never taught anyone. To be exact, it was the secret art of Baekcheong-mun that no one could learn.
Creation Island.
With a sound like a big bang, a dot appeared in the pitch-black thunderstorm. And in the next moment, the entire space-time collapsed around the dot.
A single flash that destroyed the rules of the sky, that flash brightly colored the entire sky, and then the light went out. Indra's dark clouds evaporated in an instant, and pitch-black rain began to fall all over the area. And.
<@>[Oh my God.]
Indra's gigantic incarnation was revealed in the scattered raindrops. More than half of the thousand eyes that Indra boasted of were burning black or bursting.
A moment later, Indra, who had lost his balance, began to fall.
<@>[Indra was defeated?]
The Constellations were speechless at the shocking sight of the leader of <Lokapala> being defeated.
Of course, Kyrgios was not safe either. He had to give up one of his arms to defeat Indra, who was at full power, and he suffered major injuries to his back and chest. Even so, the fact that he was able to subdue Indra with only those wounds was an absurdity.
Even if the current leaders of the Transcendent Alliance were the strongest Transcendents, it would have been difficult for them to put up such a good fight against the leader of <Lokapala>.
Nevertheless, there were two reasons why it was possible.
One was that the incarnation they possessed was the 'best body' based on the difficulty level of the 'Final Scenario'.
And the second was.
<!>[The proficiency of all skills has greatly increased due to the effect of consuming 'Murim Dumplings'!]
A 'buff' that allows all the abilities contained in that body to be expressed to the highest level is applied.
Kyrgios looked around the battlefield.
It was to find the arrogant disciple who had gifted him this body.
How many times had he looked around?
A slender doll was seen running towards somewhere beyond the pouring meteors.
Before he knew it, Cheok Jungyeong, who was standing next to Kyrgios, was also looking at the same scenery.
"He really is a strange guy. Isn't he?"
"The one person who created this miraculous scenery where all of humanity gathered to fight against the Constellations in the night sky."
His disciple was finally entering the ark to confirm the conclusion of this 'Time Fault'.
