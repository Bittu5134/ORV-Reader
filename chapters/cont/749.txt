<title>749 Episode 31 Yoo Joonghyuk (1)
<&>「The universe suddenly began one day. No one knows what happened before that.」
Perhaps that is why the 'Oldest Dream' must continue to dream.」
—Lost guide
***
The group members expressed their admiration as they saw Yoo Jonghyuk step forward.
Perhaps my companions also remembered 'that line'. Yoo Jonghyuk said a similar line when he killed Poseidon.
"Oooooh!"
"It sounds like something I’ve heard before."
"As expected, it’s Yoo Jonghyuk."
"Ah."
"I can’t believe the day has come when I hear that in person."
Dansu ahjussi, Kyung Sein, Killer King, Cha Yerin, and Ye Hyunwoo took turns spitting out a word and looking back at me at the same time.
No one opened their mouths, but I could tell what everyone was curious about.
"So is that real?"
If you think about it with common sense, there is no way he could have killed a great-grade Constellation twice in just 41 rounds.
So that's why they're asking.
I nodded slightly. That's real. Because this '41st round' is special.
"Oooh!"
As if she had received some sort of permission from my answer, Kyung Sein was excited and clapped her hands as she chanted his name.
"Yoo Jonghyuk! Yoo Jonghyuk! Yoo Jonghyuk!"
Dansu ahjussi also screamed in excitement.
Killer King nodded and muttered quietly.
"Go, Supreme King."
Amid the noisy cheering, Yoo Jonghyuk glanced towards us.
Seeing the line between his eyebrows, he must be in a bad mood.
Well, I think it would be burdensome if he suddenly received support like that.
Finally, his eyes turned to me. Afterwards, an [electric sound] was heard.
—After I kill that guy, it’s your turn.
Ugh, why?
There was a memory that suddenly came to mind.
<&>「"Eat, you bastard!"」
Could it be because of being fed dirt?
But it's unfair.
I have never fed dirt to this guy. I just fed them the 'story of eating dirt'.
The guy who was controlled by the story picked up the dirt and ate it himself.
Damn, this is why I was hoping his memories would come back late.
Still, fortunately, it was a consolation to know that there was someone who would fall with me before me.
<!>[The Constellation 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' is wary of the incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk'.]
It was an unexpected reaction.
Under normal circumstances, this would have been an indignant moment, saying, "You’re going to kill me when you're just an incarnation?" or rushing in, shouting, "You bastard, how dare you!"
<!>[The Constellation 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' glares at the incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk' with a cautious expression.]
He wasn't a 'reader' anymore.
Nevertheless, being so wary of Yoo Jonghyuk means that the stories that control him are conscious of Yoo Jonghyuk.
There is a possibility that he may have read the 'reader’s' memories.
<!>[Could you have become a transcendental being?]
Transcendent.
The only mortal title that can fight against the immortal Constellations in the <Star Stream>.
However, as I remember, Yoo Jonghyuk has not yet transcended. If he had 'transcended', a system message would have already appeared.
"I can defeat you even without transcendence."
<!>[A mortal who cannot even transcend would dare to face the Constellations?]
That's right, you should come out like that.
Judging from the way he spoke, it seemed like the story 'old and sick guardian spirit' was active again.
The more he behaves like a stereotypical Constellation, the more likely he is to lose.
<!>[The Constellation 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' roars!]
The 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' is a great-grade Constellation that utilizes some of the power of his true body.
Although he was somewhat limited by probability, he was a more powerful being than the demon marquis he fought earlier.
So this time, Yoo Jonghyuk also has to do his best.
<!>['Redemption of Truth' is activated.]
Without hesitation, Yoo Jonghyuk activated 'Story Imprint'.
<!>[Part of incarnation Yoo Jonghyuk's memories are sealed.]
Redemption of Truth is a 'story imprint' that unleashes power at the cost of sealing some of the memories of the previous rounds.
Fragments of memories flowed into me as they were sealed before my eyes.
<&>「"Leader."」
That is Yoo Jonghyuk's memory that was not written down in 'Ways of Survival' or 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint'.
Yoo Jonghyuk's 24th round.
<&>「"I have a favor to ask, Captain."」
The scenery of the wide sea shimmered and waves waved before my eyes.
Was it a scenario played out on the coast? Yoo Jonghyuk and Shin Yoosoung were on the beach where the wreckage of broken ships washed up. The young girl had a large hole in her abdomen.
<&>「"I want to go back to school someday."」
A wound that cannot be healed by either the 'Spirit of Elaine Forest' or the 'Great Hwandan'.
The girl hid the wound with her hand and pretended not to notice the wound.
Shin Yoosoung held her breath in Yoo Jonghyuk's arms.
<&>「"If this world ends safely—"」
Shin Yoosoung also knows.
Schools will never reopen. Students will not return. She will never go to school.
<&>「"Please come to the graduation ceremony."」
Even though she knew it all, Shin Yoosoung had no choice but to say that.
Even though she knew very well what kind of eternity it would be remembered by Yoo Jonghyuk.
Yoo Jonghyuk now answers that eternal question.
"I can’t go to your graduation ceremony, but—"
His 24th attempt failed. The world has been destroyed and past history will never return.
Shin Yoosoung of the 24th round did not graduate.
"I won’t let you die before me."
His memories were being sealed.
If it were the Yoo Jonghyuk I knew, he would never have sealed it. However, the more important memories are sealed, the more powerful the 'Redemption of Truth' is.
Now, Yoo Jonghyuk needs a 'power' that strong.
I stretched out my hand. I wanted to shout that those memories should not be sealed. If you forget that memory, the world will be as if it never happened.
But at that moment, my eyes met with Yoo Jonghyuk.
"I."
It may be an absurd leap.
There's no way Yoo Jonghyuk in the 41st round would think like that.
But now, Yoo Jonghyuk knew clearly that I was looking at his memories, and that I was the only one witnessing the memories he would lose.
"I want you to remember this memory for me."
I read and reread Yoo Jonghyuk's memories being sealed with my fists clenched. I remembered the disappearing Shin Yoosoung and the 24th Round without missing a single word.
When I nodded, Yoo Jonghyuk turned his gaze.
<!>[All comprehensive abilities of incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk' temporarily exceed the scenario limit standards!]
<!>[Explosive power surges from your entire body!]
Yoo Jonghyuk took a leap forward with a tremendous energy. Magical power was overflowing from the guy's whole body.
Quad deud deuk!
Yoo Jonghyuk's rushing sword strike collided with the front paws of the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake'.
Yoo Jonghyuk lifted one seal from the Washington Dome and reached the same level as the 'Demon Marquis'.
But this time, that level of force is not enough.
<@>[Just that much!]
While listening to the Constellation's planned message, Yoo Jonghyuk immediately opened the second narrative engraving.
<!>[Incarnation 'Yoo Jonhhyuk' activates 'Restraint of Emotions'!]
Restraint of Emotions.
I'm nervous. This is because it reminded me of the 'Black Beast' that turned Washington Dome into hell.
At that time, there was the 'Demon King of Salvation'.
However, if Yoo Jonghyuk's transformation into a beast progresses this time, who can stop him?
—Do your part properly this time.
Yoo Jonghyuk's voice reached my ears.
A little belatedly, I remembered my promise with him. The reason he wanted to take me to the Washington scenario.
<&>「"You stop it."」
He trusted that I would get him back to normal when he had a problem.
"I’ll try."
A word I muttered without realizing it.
Killer King glanced in my direction. Fortunately, Yoo Jonghyuk's transformation began before Killer King could even open his mouth.
I watched his transformation with bated breath.
Will he become a 'black beast' again this time, or...?
<!>[Incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk'’s story engraving skill has increased significantly.]
<!>['Restraint of Emotions' evolves!]
With a dazzling beam of light, pitch-black hair covered Yoo Jonghyuk's entire body. But this time he was not the 'black beast'.
The pitch-black hair grew in an instant, followed by a fur coat reminiscent of the [Beast Lord's sensitivity] used by 'Beast Lord' Shin Yoosoung.
The difference is that Yoo Jonghyuk's fur coat was black.
Killer King, who was watching the scene from the side, widened his eyes.
"Long hair, fur coat… Could it be the Emperor of Heilang?"
Normally, I would have retorted to Killer King's nonsense, but this time, I was so overwhelmed by Yoo Jonghyuk's atmosphere that I couldn't think of anything else to say.
Wearing a black fur coat, Yoo Jonghyuk really looked like a prince of the demon world who reigned over ten thousand horses.
Maybe that is another form of the 'Black Beast'.
<@>[How—]
While the story of the 'old and sick guardian deity' continued to lurk in secret, Yoo Jonghyuk’s new form moved.
It's so fast that you can't even see it.
Even after learning [Way of the Wind], it was a speed that I couldn't follow with my eyes.
The astonished tiger screamed. However, neither the rushing spears nor the tiger's paws could catch Yoo Jonghyuk.
No story in this world could redeem Yoo Jonghyuk.
Breaking The Sky Sword Technique.
A skill that has been trained and trained to reach its peak.
In a sense, the 'Recycling Center' was his solo stage.
All of his techniques have gone beyond the level of 'skill'. In other words, it is not restricted by skill seals.
Breaking The Sky Meteor Strike.
A meteor blossomed in the swordplay of 'Sain Tragedy Sword'. Stars cried out above every trace of the sword.
"Gaaaaaagh!"
The ghosts hit by the meteor fragments disappeared into light.
Truly overwhelming force.
The meteor shower pierced every part of the tiger’s body like a storm.
<@>[Kaaaaaa!]
The Constellation's scream spread throughout Zone 13.
<!>[The Constellation 'Liverless Rabbit' opens its eyes in astonishment!]
<!>[The Constellation 'Rat spreading plague’ is scared.]
<!>[The Constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' holds his breath.]
The slowly moving front paw of the tiger. Yoo Jonghyuk did not miss the short gap and fired back and forth.
The sword dug into the hole pierced by the meteor shower, connecting the holes like connecting Constellations.
With the sound of something breaking, the tiger's front paw flew through the air.
<!>[The Constellation 'Reclining Dragon' is overwhelmed by the power of the incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk'.]
<!>[The Constellation 'The One Who Brought Ten Lambs' cannot take their eyes off incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk'.]
I felt a thrill amidst the ecstatic tales scattered throughout.
<&>「A black wolf was hunting a tiger.」
There was no human feeling in the graceful movement of the sword. What was reflected in the trajectory was simply the time of hardship endured by Yoo Jonghyuk.
Memories of training his sword day and night to defeat the Constellations in the sky.
<@>[K-keaaaa—my arm! My arm—how dare you—!]
All those memories were concentrated and summed up in a single body.
He narrowed the distance with the gait of [Red Pheonix Steps], blocked incoming blows with [Defense Strength], and dealt with the oncoming spear ghosts with [Hundred Step God Fist].
And cut the Constellation with [Breaking The Sky Swordsmanship].
Breaking The Sky Mad King’s Dance.
Dozens of sword lights pierced both legs of the tiger. One knee buckled, and then the other knee buckled again.
The huge tiger's body lost its balance and fell forward. Yoo Jonghyuk didn't let go of the opportunity and flew towards the guy's neck.
He was only on his eighth scenario.
In the eighth scenario, Yoo Jonghyuk was trying to accomplish the feat of dropping a Constellation from the sky with his own strength.
<!>[The story 'Old and Sick Guardian Deity' disappears.]
<!>[The story 'Rotten Dongajul' is activated in exchange for the 'Old and Sick Guardian Deity'!]
<&>「Rotten Dongajul.」
The unique story of the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' who escaped a desperate crisis.
<!>[The story 'Rotten Dongajul' begins its storytelling.]
Although it was a similar technique to Nirvana's [No Possession], this story demanded a more terrible price than [No Possession].
Just before Yoo Jonghyuk's sword touched the guy's neck, a bright red fireball burst out from the tiger's chest along with the sound of fu-chem. Red snowflakes were scattered on the ground, creating a red sorghum field.
The image of the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' began to disperse like smoke among the blood-stained sorghum fields.
<@>[I am dissatisfied. Since I was unable to get the little one—]
The mantra of the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' rang out as if he were sorrowful.
His gaze full of hatred that had been on me soon turned to someone else.
<@>[I will take the other one.]
