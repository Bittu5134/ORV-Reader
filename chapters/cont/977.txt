<title>977 Episode 58 Mythical Constellation (9)
After a brief silence, I asked.
<@>[What does that mean?]
It wasn't simply because I was puzzled by his question. Right now, I needed to buy some time.
<#>【It means it literally. A recorder who records himself cannot be included in the 'Final Record'.】
That couldn't be true. Because I've seen recorders who record themselves before. The 'Unchanging One' was a prime example.
<#>【I know what you're thinking. But think carefully. What is the purpose of 'records' and 'recorders'?】
<!>[What are you trying to say?]
<#>【You are different from other recorders. You are the one who records this world while simultaneously executing the scenario.】
<@>[So?]
<#>【Characters have their own roles, writers have their own roles, and readers have their own roles.】
I held my breath, never expecting to hear such a thing from Asmodeus.
<#>【If one being occupies all those spaces, how can the story flow properly?】
I thought I understood what Asmodeus was saying.
Ultimately, a story must flow to the empty space. But if one being occupies all the empty spaces in a story, the story will have nowhere to go.
<#>【Reflect on the plan. If you want to survive this whole story, then so be it.】
I stared at the empty space of the skill—[□□]—that flickered before my eyes. The empty space was beautiful, alluring, and distant. A blank space that seemed to suck you in if you stared at it intently.
On that blank space, I had written countless sentences. Sometimes I wrote words of encouragement for someone, and sometimes I wrote about someone's death.
<&>「I knew that every time I used this power to record myself, the cost would be wrong.」
The blank space rippled as if it would suck me in at any moment.
<&>「What does it mean to record myself?」
Is it even possible to record myself in a novel?
Is the me recorded even me?
No, in the first place—
<&>「Who exactly is 'I'?」
As if trying to settle all those questions, I slowly opened my mouth.
<!>[It doesn't matter.]
<#>【Huh?】
<!>[If you were going to stop threatening me, you wouldn't have become a recorder in the first place.]
Asmodeus chuckled, as if he had expected that much.
<#>【Well, I suppose that's why even the Black Flame Dragon was so captivated by you.】
<@>[What?]
Instead of answering right away, Asmodeus lowered his head and looked at the Black Flame Dragon. Within the achromatic field of vision, the Black Flame Dragon was breathing slowly.
<#>【Aren't you curious? Why did the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' end up like this?】
<!>[At this point, it seems you were the one who succeeded with your tongue.]
Asmodeus seemed determined to prolong this standoff. I could guess his intentions.
<&>「An ancient story has begun to boil within the Black Flame Dragon.」
Asmodeus was using a 'crest' to prepare for the Black Flame Dragon's second attack. Having sensed that I, too, could wield 'myth-grade' power, he was probably preparing a strike that would wipe me and the constellations out in one fell swoop.
But I, too, needed time.
<&>「It's difficult to defeat the Black Flame Dragon with my current strength alone.」
I could sense the Sun Hunter's gaze from afar.
<&>「The Sun Hunter's new arrows will soon be loaded.」
Even for the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', it won't be easy to resist the 'Ten Fingers of God' once again. If my prediction is correct, the arrow the Sun Hunter is currently preparing will be something special.
<&>「Whichever of us finishes 'preparing' first will hold the hilt.」
I spoke, pretending not to reveal the truth.
<@>[Stop talking nonsense and leave the Black Flame Dragon alone. I don't know what tricks you're using to manipulate him, but—]
<#>【Manipulation? Do you believe I used some nefarious scheme to make him like this?】
<@>[Otherwise, the Black Flame Dragon wouldn't have changed like that.]
A gloomy and destructive aura flowed from the Black Flame Dragon's entire body. Especially, the story at its core conveyed the Black Flame Dragon's emotions in real time.
I carefully wrote down the name of that emotion.
<&>「A feeling of loss.」
I don't know what the Black Flame Dragon has lost. However, he had something on the Black Flame Dragon, and as a result, the latter fell into madness.
<!>[Did you steal from the Black Flame Dragon?]
Even as I asked, I didn't expect Asmodeus to respond obediently. After all, both he and I were just stalling for time. So, there was no way he could properly answer with aplomb.
<#>【Why do you think I stole from him?】
But, unexpectedly, Asmodeus's expression was serious.
<#>【If I leave him here like you did, he'll completely collapse. Because the only reason he can carry out the scenario now is because of my 'record'.】
<!>[…]
<#>【Poor Black Flame Dragon. Looking at his expression right now, I can't even imagine how sad he must be.】
I knew this was Asmodeus's trap. I shouldn't ask any more questions. But the moment I heard him speak, I couldn't help but ask.
<#>【Don't you really know? He became like this because of you.】
<!>[What nonsense are you talking about? I've never had proper contact with the 'Black Flame Dragon' in this worldline.]
The smile on Asmodeus's face deepened at my question.
<#>【As you know, many strange things have happened in this worldline.】
The moment I heard him speak, I felt an ominous feeling.
<#>【Those who shouldn't have intervened have interfered with the scenario, and in return, this worldline has been completely distorted.】
Even though I thought it was impossible to draw, a plot twist was already forming in my head.
<&>「How did the Black Flame Dragon obtain 'myth-grade' power?」
Even if he was the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', there was no way he could have attained 'myth-grade' status without undergoing the 'Great War of Good and Evil' and gaining the protection of the Apocalypse Dragon.
However, I knew of one possible 'plot'.
<#>【If you're curious, read it yourself.】
<!>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', warns you!]
The story was warning. I shouldn't read that. That if I did, I'd never be able to return to where I was before.
Nevertheless, I reached out to the Black Flame Dragon. As if responding to my gesture, sentences filled with pitch-black blanks began to flow toward me.
—Kim Dokja.
I closed my eyes, and the Black Dragon's voice came to my ears. But it wasn't calling me.
—Where are you?
I knew who the Black Flame Dragon was calling.
<&>「In the universe I know, the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' has already reached the power of a mythical constellation.」
The 1,864th round’s great disaster.
An ancient story was challenging me before my eyes.
—Aren't you going to tell me more?
In the deep darkness, his story began to project.
The Black Flame Dragon I know well. The star that contracted with Han Sooyoung, lent her power, and continued the scenario with <Kim Dokja Company>.
—Tell me more.
The Black Flame Dragon in the story roared. He, who had finally gained the power of the 'Final Dragon of the Apocalypse', was fighting the 'Nameless Mist'.
—Tell me your story isn't over yet.
The Black Flame Dragon was there.
With Uriel and the Great Jecheon, he danced passionately on the stage created by humans.
I watched the Black Flame Dragon on stage from the audience. Then, an audience member standing next to me spoke to me.
—Why do I look so happy over there?
Another Black Flame Dragon stood there. I tried to answer him with a blank expression. But just as I was about to answer, my eyes met the Black Flame Dragon on stage.
—There you were.
A chill ran down my spine, and the stage lights went out.
In the darkness, Asmodeus asked,
<#>【Do you now understand what you have done?】
All beings move in pursuit of their favorite stories. Just as Uriel, the Mass-Production Maker, and Kim Dokja Company did.
And perhaps the 1,864th round’s 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' came to this worldline just like them.
<&>「Because Kim Dokja began writing a new story.」
He possessed himself in this worldline and observed my story.
<#>【Now, look. The monster of this worldline you created.】
I gazed at the Black Flame Dragon before me. He was the 41st round’s 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', but he was also the 1,864th round’s 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon'.
But the laws of this world do not allow for such 'overlapping of beings'.
<&>「The broken film theory.」
Not all constellations were as fortunate as Uriel or the Mass-Production Maker. Worldlines overlapped, souls mingled, and for some constellations, their very existences gradually became entangled.
<&>「What will become of the star that has seen the end of the 'story' it longed to reach? Will they be happy, or will they be saddened by the fact that all that journey has been taken away from them?」
Thus, the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon became the Light Dragon King.
<#>【Kim Dokja, do you think the romance you envision is still a memory everyone longs for?】
From beyond the records, the 'Demon King of the Cinema' spoke.
<#>【Do you naively believe that by recalling those memories, you and <Kim Dokja Company> will reach the grand house of your dreams?】
Asmodeus continued to speak, mocking me.
<#>【Those trapped in memories will perish while holding onto them. You will witness their destruction and face the destined end of this world.】
As if issuing a banishing order, the breath of the Abyss began to form around the Black Dragon's mouth. To my surprise, the Black Flame Dragon's breath had already been recharged.
<#>【So, please remain calm and be defeated.】
Embrace the things you cannot change and writhe in sorrow.
As if possessed by Asmodeus's words, I approached the Black Flame Dragon. The smile on Asmodeus's face deepened.
I placed my hand on the Black Flame Dragon's massive body.
<!>[The stories of the constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', are responding to you!]
The stories that had driven him to madness began to entangle themselves in my fingertips.
<@>[I already know that this world is not normal.]
Asmodeus's eyes wavered at my calm voice.
Sensing the stories of the Black Flame Dragon, I continued speaking.
<@>[I also know that there are some people who can never be saved, and some stories cannot be changed.]
The Black Flame Dragon was looking down at me. I began to pull out the thorns embedded in its body, one by one. With each thorn pulled out, the Black Flame Dragon's massive body flinched and roared.
<#>【What are you doing, Kim Dokja?】
Asmodeus growled.
<#>【This is nonsense. Even if it’s you, do you think you can handle the madness of a myth-grade constellation?】
The Black Flame Dragon's thorns, forcibly pulled out, began to flow into my body. The Black Flame Dragon's memories ran wild. The thorns crushed my blood vessels and tore through my muscles. I took them in with my whole body. The thorns poured out ceaselessly from my mouth, and my legs shook in confusion. Yet, I endured.
<!>[The exclusive trait, 'Understander of the Abyss', aids your understanding.]
With each thorn pulled out, the Black Dragon's gaze began to change slightly. His eyes, once plagued by madness, were returning to a calming crimson. The breath he had been preparing was slowly dissipating.
<&>「The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon grew by devouring the hearts of the twelve Demon Kings…」
<&>「The madness of overlapping world lines corrupted the Black Flame Dragon's mind…」
<&>「The roar of a mythical dragon, unstoppable by anything…」
Asmodeus's hastily added words descended upon the Black Flame Dragon. The moment the Black Flame Dragon belatedly moved its arm to shake me off,
<@>[I'm sorry.]
I held onto its massive frame and unleashed [Incite], imbued with the power of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.
<@>[I'm sorry for making you read the story alone.]
I, speaking these words, was not the 'Kim Dokja' the Black Flame Dragon had hoped for. And the Black Flame Dragon listening to the story was not the Black Flame Dragon Kim Dokja remembered.
<@>[I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the story you loved.]
I don't even know who I am, but I must continue this story.
<!>[Abyssal Black Flame Dragon, this story is not a burden you should bear. So from now on—]
Because this is the only way to understand who you and I are.
<!>[I will record you.]
With a roar that made the world creak, the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' stopped moving.
<#>【Kim Dokja!】
I saw Asmodeus rushing towards me with a terrified expression. The situation was so dire that the recorder had to materialize himself and use physical force. But it was already too late.
<&>「The Sun Hunter's slaughter is finally ready.」
Because my 'sentence' was finally complete.
<&>「The Fourth Finger of the Emperor—'The Ring Finger That Breaks All Bonds'.」
As if he had been waiting, the Sun Hunter released his bow.
<#>【Damn it! Stop—!】
This arrow's power was the power to interfere with the very 'promise' of the solemn <Star Stream>.
<!>[Get out of here, Asmodeus.]
In other words, this arrow could temporarily interfere with all kinds of bonds existing within the <Star Stream>.
<&>「Even if it were a sacred 'record contract'.」
The arrow, flying like a flash, pierced Asmodeus' heart.
