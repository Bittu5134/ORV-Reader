<title>977 Episode 58 Myth-grade Constellation (9)
After a brief silence, I asked.
<@>[What exactly does that mean?]
It wasn't simply because I was puzzled by his question. Right now, I needed to buy time.
<#>【It means exactly what it sounds like. A recorder who records himself cannot be included in the 'Final Record'.】
That couldn't be true. I had seen recorders document themselves before. The 'Unchanging One' was the prime example.
<#>【I know what you're thinking. But think carefully. What is the true purpose of 'records' and 'recorders'?】
<!>[What are you trying to say?]
<#>【You are different from other recorders. You are the one who seeks to record this world while simultaneously executing its scenarios.】
<@>[So?]
<#>【Characters have their roles, writers have their roles, and readers have their roles.】
I held my breath. I never expected to hear such fundamental logic from Asmodeus.
<#>【If one being occupies all those spaces, how can the story flow properly?】
I thought I understood his point. Ultimately, a story must flow into empty space. If one being occupies every role, the story has nowhere to go.
<#>【Reflect on your path. If you want to survive this entire story, so be it.】
I stared at the empty space of the skill—[□□]—that flickered before my eyes. The void was beautiful, alluring, and terrifyingly distant. It was a blank space that seemed to suck one in if stared at for too long. On that blank canvas, I had written countless sentences. Sometimes I wrote words of encouragement; sometimes, I wrote of someone's death.
<&>「I knew that every time I used this power to record myself, the price was fundamentally wrong.」
The blank space rippled as if it would swallow me at any moment.
<&>「What does it truly mean to record myself?」
Is it even possible to record oneself in a novel? Is the recorded 'me' even 'me'? No, in the first place—
<&>「Who exactly is 'I'?」
As if trying to settle those questions, I finally spoke.
<!>[It doesn't matter.]
<#>【What?】
<!>[If you were going to stop because of a few words, you wouldn't have become a recorder in the first place.]
Asmodeus chuckled, as if he had expected that much.
<#>【Well, I suppose that's why even the Black Flame Dragon was so captivated by you.】
<@>[What do you mean?]
Instead of answering immediately, Asmodeus lowered his head to look at the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon. Within the achromatic field of vision, the dragon was breathing in slow, heavy rasps.
<#>【Aren't you curious? Why did the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' end up like this?】
<!>[At this point, it seems you were the one who succeeded only with your tongue.]
Asmodeus seemed determined to prolong the standoff. I could guess his intentions.
<&>「An ancient story has begun to boil within the Black Flame Dragon.」
Asmodeus was using a 'crest' to prepare for a second attack. Having sensed that I, too, could wield 'myth-grade' status, he was likely preparing a strike to wipe me and the constellations out in one sweep. But I, too, needed time.
<&>「It is difficult to defeat the Black Flame Dragon with my current strength alone.」
I could sense the Sun Hunter's gaze from afar.
<&>「The Sun Hunter's new arrows will soon be loaded.」
Even for the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', it wouldn't be easy to resist the 'Ten Fingers of God' a second time. If my prediction was correct, the arrow he was preparing would be something special.
<&>「Whichever of us finishes 'preparing' first will hold the hilt.」
I spoke, masking the truth.
<@>[Stop talking nonsense and leave the Black Flame Dragon alone. I don't know what tricks you're using to manipulate him, but—]
<#>【Manipulation? Do you believe I used some nefarious scheme to make him this way?】
<@>[Otherwise, he wouldn't have changed like that.]
A gloomy, destructive aura flowed from the dragon's entire body. The story at its core conveyed the dragon's emotions in real time. I carefully identified that feeling.
<&>「A profound sense of loss.」
I didn't know what the Black Flame Dragon had lost. However, Asmodeus held something over him, and as a result, the dragon had fallen into madness.
<!>[Did you steal from him?]
Even as I asked, I didn't expect a straight answer. Both of us were just stalling for time.
<#>【Why do you think I stole from him?】
Unexpectedly, Asmodeus’s expression turned serious.
<#>【If I leave him here like you did, he'll completely collapse. The only reason he can carry out the scenario now is because of my 'record'.】
<!>[…]
<#>【Poor Black Flame Dragon. Looking at his expression right now, I can't even imagine how sad he must be.】
I knew this was Asmodeus's trap. I shouldn't ask any more questions. But the moment he spoke, the question escaped me.
<#>【Don't you really know? He became like this because of you.】
<!>[What nonsense is that? I've never had proper contact with the 'Black Flame Dragon' in this worldline.]
The smile on Asmodeus's face deepened.
<#>【As you know, many strange things have happened in this worldline.】
The moment he spoke, an ominous feeling washed over me.
<#>【Those who shouldn't have intervened have interfered with the scenario, and in return, this worldline has been completely distorted.】
Even though I thought it was impossible to draw, a plot twist was already forming in my head.
<&>「How did the Black Flame Dragon obtain 'myth-grade' power?」
Even as the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', he couldn't have attained mythical status without the 'Great War of Good and Evil' and the protection of the Apocalypse Dragon. However, I knew of one possible plot.
<#>【If you're curious, read it yourself.】
<!>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', warns you!]
My story was screaming at me. It told me I shouldn't read that—that if I did, I'd never be able to return to who I was. Nevertheless, I reached out to the dragon. As if responding to my gesture, sentences filled with pitch-black blanks began to flow toward me.
—Kim Dokja.
I closed my eyes, and the dragon's voice reached me. But it wasn't calling for me.
—Where are you?
I knew who the Black Flame Dragon was calling.
<&>「In the universe I know, the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' had already reached the power of a mythical constellation.」
The great disaster of the 1,864th round. An ancient story was challenging me.
—Aren't you going to tell me more?
In the deep darkness, his story began to project. The Black Flame Dragon I knew well. The star that contracted with Han Sooyoung and continued the scenario with <Kim Dokja Company>.
—Tell me more.
The dragon in the story roared. Having gained the power of the 'Final Dragon of the Apocalypse', he was fighting the 'Nameless Mist'.
—Tell me your story isn't over yet.
The Black Flame Dragon was there. With Uriel and the Great Sage, he danced passionately on the stage created by humans. I watched him from the audience. Then, an audience member standing next to me spoke.
—Why do I look so happy over there?
Another Black Flame Dragon stood there. I tried to answer with a blank expression, but then my eyes met the dragon on stage.
—There you were.
A chill ran down my spine as the stage lights went out. In the darkness, Asmodeus asked:
<#>【Do you now understand what you have done?】
All beings move in pursuit of their favorite stories. Just as Uriel and <Kim Dokja Company> did. And perhaps the 1,864th round’s 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' came to this worldline just like them.
<&>「Because Kim Dokja began writing a new story.」
He possessed himself in this worldline and observed my story.
<#>【Now, look. The monster of this worldline you created.】
I gazed at the dragon before me. He was the 41st round’s 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', but also the 1,864th round’s. But the laws of this world do not permit such an 'overlapping of beings'.
<&>「The broken film theory.」
Not all constellations were as fortunate as Uriel. Worldlines overlapped, souls mingled, and for some, their very existences became entangled.
<&>「What becomes of a star that has seen the end of the 'story' it longed to reach? Will they be happy, or will they be saddened that the entire journey was taken away?」
Thus, the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon became a Mad Dragon.
<#>【Kim Dokja, do you think the romance you envision is still a memory everyone longs for?】
From beyond the records, the 'Demon King of the Cinema' spoke.
<#>【Do you naively believe that by recalling those memories, you and <Kim Dokja Company> will reach the grand house of your dreams?】
Asmodeus continued to mock me.
<#>【Those trapped in memories will perish while holding onto them. You will witness their destruction and face the destined end of this world.】
As if issuing a banishing order, the breath of the Abyss began to form in the dragon's maw. To my surprise, his breath had already recharged.
<#>【So, please remain calm and be defeated.】
Embrace the things you cannot change and writhe in sorrow. As if possessed, I approached the Black Flame Dragon. The smile on Asmodeus's face deepened. I placed my hand on the dragon's massive body.
<!>[The stories of the constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', are responding to you!]
The stories that had driven him to madness began to entangle themselves in my fingertips.
<@>[I already know that this world is not normal.]
Asmodeus's eyes wavered at my calm voice. Sensing the dragon's stories, I continued.
<@>[I also know that some people can never be saved, and some stories cannot be changed.]
The dragon looked down at me. I began to pull out the thorns embedded in its body, one by one. With each thorn removed, the dragon flinched and roared.
<#>【What are you doing, Kim Dokja?】
Asmodeus growled.
<#>【This is nonsense. Even if it’s you, do you think you can handle the madness of a myth-grade constellation?】
The thorns began to flow into my body. The dragon's memories ran wild, crushing my blood vessels and tearing through my muscles. I took them in with my whole body. Thorns poured out from my mouth, and my legs shook. Yet, I endured.
<!>[The exclusive trait, 'Understander of the Abyss', aids your understanding.]
With each thorn removed, the dragon's gaze changed. His eyes, once plagued by madness, returned to a calming crimson. The breath he had been preparing dissipated.
<&>「The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon grew by devouring the hearts of the twelve Demon Kings…」
<&>「The madness of overlapping worldlines corrupted the dragon's mind…」
<&>「The roar of a mythical dragon, unstoppable by anything…」
Asmodeus's hastily added words descended upon the dragon. The moment the Black Flame Dragon moved to shake me off, I whispered.
<@>[I'm sorry.]
I held onto his massive frame and unleashed [Incite].
<@>[I'm sorry for making you read the story alone.]
The 'Kim Dokja' speaking these words was not the one the dragon hoped for. And the dragon listening was not the one I remembered.
<@>[I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the story you loved.]
I don't know who I am, but I must continue this story.
<!>[Abyssal Black Flame Dragon, this story is not a burden you should bear. So from now on—]
Because this is the only way to understand who we are.
<!>[I will record you.]
With a roar that made the world creak, the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' stopped moving.
<#>【Kim Dokja!】
I saw Asmodeus rushing towards me, his expression terrified. He was forced to materialize and use physical force, but it was too late.
<&>「The Sun Hunter's strike is finally ready.」
Because my sentence was finally complete.
<&>「The Fourth Finger of the Emperor—'The Ring Finger That Breaks All Bonds'.」
As if he had been waiting, the Sun Hunter released his bow.
<#>【Damn it! Stop—!】
This arrow's power was the power to interfere with the absolute 'promises' of the <Star Stream>.
<!>[Get out of here, Asmodeus.]
In other words, this arrow could temporarily sever all bonds existing within the <Star Stream>.
<&>「Even a sacred 'record contract'.」
The arrow, flying like a flash, pierced Asmodeus' heart.
