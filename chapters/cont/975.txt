<title>975 Episode 58 Mythical Constellation (7)
'Ways of Survival' features a plethora of beings originating from the 'Primal Darkness'.
The most representative example was the 'Wenny King', a being born alongside the 'Dokkaebi King' in the first Myeongyang.
On the other hand, there were those who reached the Primal Darkness through their own myths.
The demon god Abaddon, the 'ruler of the abyss', and the spirit Hades, the lord of the spirit world, were examples of this.
There were also those who acquired the primal darkness through corruption, such as the Archangel Michael and other high-ranking demon lords.
However, whether born with the dark attribute or born from it, all beings embracing the Primal Darkness shared a common trait.
<&>「Beings already mythical, or infinitely close to it.」
The star that had materialized before my eyes was one such being.
I thought I might see him someday. But I hadn't expected to encounter him here, in this way.
"Kim Anna-ssi, please stay back. No matter what, you must not come near."
I glanced at Anna briefly, then pushed her back and stepped forward. Then, as if waiting, a record surged before my eyes.
<&>「The pitch-black shadow of a light dragon shimmered in the thick darkness. Just meeting its eyes suffocated me with murderous intent. The most sublime and solemn being in this universe was coiled there, watching me.」
I gulped, then recited his epithet.
"Abyssal Black Flame Dragon."
The star that ruled the Nebula Black Cloud and was Han Sooyoung's sponsor in the main story.
<&>「Why, has he descended here now to attack Mitra?」
<!>[No, you can't. Run away—]
Mitra, having spotted me, cried out in a fit of rage.
I looked up at the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon'. The entity, fully revealed in the pitch-black darkness, took the form of a gigantic black dragon.
I opened my mouth as if to pay my respects.
"Master of the great <Black Cloud>."
The 'Abyss Black Flame Dragon' I remember was a constellation of the highest level, a narrative-grade. However, the powerful black dragon before me now, no matter how I looked at it, was clearly a mythical one. Even the intense malice emanating from its entire being was quite different from the Black Flame Dragon I remembered.
How had this happened? Why had the Black Flame Dragon become such a sinister constellation, a mythical one?
I don't know. In any case, I needed to buy time.
<&>「The impact of the rebound from 'Demon King of Salvation' mode still lingers.」
The power I had exhausted in the last match hadn't yet been restored, so if I clashed with the mythical constellations here, I could be reduced to dust, not just Kim Dokja fragments.
Furthermore, if things continued this way, not only would I be reduced to dust, but Jung Heewon would die as well. Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a transparent bush just below the border of the mythic constellations.
<!>[Story, 'Regret, Exhaustion, Obsession', continues its storytelling.]
Jung Heewon's story was heard from within the bush. Indeed, inside the transparent bush, Jung Heewon and other incarnations were huddled together.
I immediately recognized the bush's true nature.
<&>「Exposed Bush.」
The bush's effect was simple.
<&>「The 'Exposed Bush' allows the inside of the bush to be seen from the outside, but the incarnations inside are immune to external damage.」
It was one of the bushes used to evade danger on the battlefield.
<!>[Currently, 'Exposed Bush' has five minutes remaining.]
Unfortunately, this bush had a time limit, and its damage prevention effect was a one-time thing.
I saw Jung Heewon inspecting the injured incarnations from within the exposed bush. Perhaps Jung Heewon had sensed the clash between the mythic constellations and quickly retreated into the bush. It was a wise decision, but the problem was that the bush was located right at the feet of the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon'.
The clash of myth-grade constellations had the destructive power of a nuclear bomb exploding before my eyes, so even Jung Heewon would be mortally wounded once the bush's effect ended.
So, my task was clear.
<&>「I will stop the fight between the myth-grade constellations before the 'Exposed Bush' time limit expires.」
"Abyssal Black Flame Dragon!"
But the Black Flame Dragon paid no heed to my shout.
After tearing off Mitra's wing, he began to crush the fallen Mitra with his massive foot.
<@>[Ooooooooooo—!]
Hearing Mitra's agonized screams, I took another step closer.
"Can't you hear me?"
Of course. That noble dragon—even a star of mythic status—wouldn't be able to hear the voice of a mere human.
So, what about this? I took a deep breath and uttered my incantation.
<!>[Abyssal Black Flame Dragon, you, who are closer to being the 'Final Dragon' than anyone else, how did you end up like this?]
The Black Flame Dragon slowly turned its head towards me. It felt as if the abyss of the universe was peering into me. I desperately used the power of the 'Giant Story' to neutralize its gaze.
<!>[I ask why a great constellation like you is acting like a pawn on such a trivial stage.]
The 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' was a powerful dragon, considered a final candidate for the 'Final Dragon of the Apocalypse' in the main story. However, no matter how I looked at it, he didn't look like the 'Final Dragon' at the moment.
It was only natural.
<&>「Kim Dokja of the Snowfield foresaw and blocked the signs of the Holy Demon War in 'The Night of the Blue Witch'.」
Because the 'Holy Demon War', where the 'Final Dragon of the Apocalypse' would be born, didn't take place in this 41st round. The scattered pieces of information in my mind finally connected.
<&>「What if the fact that the 'Holy Demon War' was stopped affected the Black Flame Dragon?」
I couldn’t tell if this was the original plot of the 41st round.
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.???', is activated!]
However, due to snowfield Kim Dokja, the Black Flame Dragon lost his chance to become the 'Final Dragon of the Apocalypse'. He was consumed by an inexplicable rage and grief, spewing out stories of corruption.
<!>[Are you willing to abandon your beliefs just because you failed to become the Final Dragon of the Apocalypse? Did you endure all this time just to become a disaster on the battlefield?]
I don’t intend to say the Black Flame Dragon was a good constellation. To begin with, he, who aspired to become the worst disaster in the <Star Stream>, couldn’t possibly be of the type of same constellation as Uriel. Nevertheless.
<&>「At least there was a certain purity in the Black Flame Dragon.」
What constellation was the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon'?
All I know about him is the records. I don't know if those records were true or just Han Sooyoung's delusions. But that's the only way we can read someone else.
<&>「The Black Flame Dragon, who reveled in Kim Dokja's misfortune and sometimes showed a mischievous side.」
We judge someone through arbitrary interpretations, through single sentences, through descriptions that fail to explain anything.
<&>「The immature constellation, who believed himself to be a 15-year-old child and always walked around with a bandage on one hand.」
I imagine his story.
<&>「The star that fought to protect a single reader until the very end in the final war.」
<!>[At least, that's not the way I knew you.]
When we claim to understand someone, that's always the only story we can tell.
<!>[The constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', roars!]
I continued to babble, feeling the pressure threatening to crush me at any moment.
<!>[Even if this is my own arbitrary misreading, even if it's not the story of this worldline.]
The story of the 'Demon King of Salvation' was flowing out of me.
The image of the Black Flame Dragon, as Kim Dokja remembered it, was projected before my eyes.
<!>[He was definitely you, too. I read it. So—]
This world is about to become a gigantic incite. If only I could convince the other person of the story I see.
<!>[I also know clearly that this situation is not of your own will.]
Incite soon becomes truth.
<!>[The constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', frowns as if in pain.]
As I continued speaking, the darkness gradually became familiar to my eyes. Within the darkness, sentences poured out, as if refuting my words.
<&>「The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon frowned at the insignificant creature before him. How can a human he's never seen before speak so carelessly about him?」
<@>[No, that wasn't you.]
<&>「He was an evil dragon. This <Star Stream> was destined to become the ultimate disaster. He was the star that would defeat Mitra here and claim a higher place in mythology.」
<!>[How long will you surrender yourself to the 'records' written by others?]
The Black Flame Dragon's massive form paused for the first time. I gazed at the darkness behind it.
The darkness of the beginning.
Beyond that lay the being that recorded the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon'.
And then, from somewhere, a laughter came. A laughter I knew well. The laughter of the one I loathed more than anyone else.
<#>【That was truly a moving speech.】
I had expected it from the moment I first laid eyes on the Black Flame Dragon. No matter how reckless the Black Flame Dragon was, a constellation renowned for its rampage, a star that had maintained its ego for so long could not lose it overnight and become an evil dragon.
The entire expanse of spacetime began to turn a pale gray. Spacetime warped, and a clock shared only by the 'Recorders' unfolded. A world where the story had stopped.
Behind the Black Flame Dragon stood a man. Dressed in a gothic, pitch-black dress, he was the Demon King of the movie theater, just like I knew him from the original.
<@>[Asmodeus.]
<#>【It's been a while, Kim Dokja.】
Perhaps it was because of my changed mood? Asmodeus's expression was a bit strange. He studied me intently and then spoke again.
<#>【I've heard rumors. Have you really reached 'myth-grade'?】
<@>[Yes.]
After all, you can't fool someone who reigns supreme among the 'Recorders of Fear'. In that case, it's better to go out there with confidence.
<!>[What on earth are you doing here?]
<#>【That's a ridiculous question. What would a Recorder do if he's not recording?】
<!>[I don't know if you're just decorating the moon, but just release the Black Flame Dragon.]
<#>【That's problematic. What happens if I refuse?】
<!>[There will be a price to pay.]
Asmodeus then burst into laughter, seemingly amused.
<#>【Price? Me? Are you serious?】
Asmodeus glared at me with a mocking gaze.
<#>【Your physical condition seems to be already abnormal. Do you think you can defeat the 'Mad Dragon King' I'm writing about in that incarnation body, unable to even properly use the Tao?】
Mad Dragon King. That seemed to be the nickname given to the 'Black Flame Dragon' of this era.
<!>[Is that a nickname you gave yourself? It's amazing how you became a recorder with such a poor sense of naming.]
<#>【Your tongue has gotten sharper since I last saw you. Surely you didn't rise to myth-grade just by using your tongue.】
I don't know why the Black Flame Dragon became a mythical evil dragon. However, as Asmodeus said, the current Black Flame Dragon was far stronger than me, even when I activated 'Demon King of Salvation' mode. But I couldn't back down now.
"Check it out if you're curious."
<#>【Good.】
The scenery shattered, and the Black Flame Dragon gained momentum. I violently spun the stories all over my body. The moment the power of the 'Giant Story' surged like a waterfall, engulfing me, something approached, shattering my story.
<&>「This was a mythical battle.」
I didn't even have time to prepare. The Black Flame Dragon's tail, appearing, shattered the rules of space and time I knew, flew from outside my sphere of perception and gripped my entire body as if squeezing it.
<@>[Hmph.]
All I could do was gather all my 'Giant Stories' to the limit to protect my own incarnation body.
As the Black Flame Dragon's massive tail wrapped itself around my entire body, a sound like the edges of a window shattering could be heard.
Kudududud.
The stories of the 'Demon King of Salvation' screamed before the overwhelming physical force.
<#>【As expected... You've definitely become mythical with your tongue, haven't you?】
Asmodeus's mocking laughter echoed in my ears, like an auditory hallucination.
<#>【This is scenario 85. No matter how strong you've become, did you really believe you could defeat a mythical dragon?】
I admit it. Certainly, the power of the Black Dragon and Asmodeus, now at the level of a myth, was beyond my imagination.
<#>【I'm looking forward to it. I wonder what the other great beings' expressions will be when they realize I've seized you…】
But I wasn't flustered.
<!>[Really?]
Asmodeus's expression changed as I remained calm in the face of the Black Dragon's oppressive story.
<!>[Are you really curious about that?]
Asmodeus's voice became urgent, as if he had belatedly realized something.
<#>【Black Dragon! Hurry, him—】
<!>[The constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', unleashes his power!]
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.???', activates to its fullest!]
Asmodeus, flustered, reached out to me.
I poured out all my story and unleashed the [Incite] mantra.
<!>[I am here.]
A mantra that everyone in this massive battlefield could hear. The sound of the forest rustling could be heard from afar.
<!>[The 'Demon King of Salvation' you seek is now here!]
For a moment, a silence descended, as if all narrative in the battlefield had ceased. The forest held its breath, and the stars in the sky twinkled silently.
And then...
<!>[The constellations of the Great Nebula, <Asgard>, have confirmed your mantra!]
The sky's probability began to stir.
<!>[The constellations of the Great Nebula, <Veda>, have confirmed your mantra!]
<!>[The constellations the Great Nebula, <Olympus>, have confirmed your mantra!]
But even with the Great Nebulae's subsequent message, Asmodeus felt his composure returning.
<#>【The myth-grade constellations on the main battlefield don't have time to pay attention to you right now. If you really thought they'd come here to claim you—】
<!>[I know. The myth-grade constellations are busy, aren't they?]
I sensed the constellations swarming toward us beyond the stirring forest. Most of them were narrative-grade constellations, targeting me. Asmodeus spoke, still scornful.
<#>【Even if you, say, a narrative-grade, come rushing in—】
<!>[Really? That's a bit different, isn't it?]
The sound of a bowstring being pulled from somewhere. It was as if the entire axis of the Earth was being pulled apart.
<!>[The constellations of the Great Nebula, <Emperor>, have confirmed your incantation!]
A gigantic red hail visible from afar. The <Emperor>'s sharpshooter, who had brought down nine suns—was aiming at this spot. His bow glowed with a supreme arrow, unseen by any mythical constellation.
<&>「The Ten Fingers of God.」
A common form carved from the fingers of the <Emperor>'s highest-ranking constellation—the Emperor's Gok of the Five Emperors.
Asmodeus, belatedly realizing this, roared. However, the 'Sun Hunter' was a little faster.
<!>[Let him go, evil dragon.]
The white arrow emitted light.
