<title>678 Episode 21 Kim Dokja (14)
As the wall collapsed, memories came flooding in from beyond.
Memories that I didn't believe were mine.
Sentences that were as distant as the author and the characters seeped into my skin, blood vessels, and brain.
I could see the founder of the Absolute Throne coming towards me in the distance. Although he lost one wing, he survived the explosion.
He was not dead, but was walking to destroy this world.
<&>「So who am I.」
In the creeping cold, I thought about my arrogance. The arrogance that tried to contemplate this story, that dared to write about this world.
"Han Sooyoung."
Han Sooyoung’s miracle could not be felt anywhere. I didn't feel her story.
<&>「"Why did you want to become a writer?"」
Holding Han Sooyoung's sword, I stood up slowly. Now there was no more Han Sooyoung's story that protected me. 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' stopped its storytelling and 'Predicted Plagiarism' failed to predict the future.
It came running high and far away, and I also ran towards it.
We cut each other's flesh with each other's swords. I thought about the living pain of the blade cutting into my body.
<&>「You can’t just be a writer.」
To see the ending of this story, you shouldn't be in such a presumptuous position.
<&>「I have to live in this world properly.」
We have to face it.
We must live in this clear world that exists through blood and swords.
It has to be a unique character.
A person who knows this story better than anyone else. The only person who has the potential to clear this scenario.
The founder of the Absolute Throne asked amidst a storm of magical power.
<#>【Who are you Who are you】
"I am Kim Dokja."
It was not [Incite].
The guy tilted his head. It seemed like he didn't know who Kim Dokja was.
"I am."
So I did it one more time.
"Kim Dokja."
I said that cursed name.
<!>[The story 'Recorder of Things that will Disappear' begins its storytelling.]
A story that was about to disappear stayed with me.
As I felt the narrative gripping a pen, I recalled the moment I first entered this world.
I thought of a story I wanted to write. I wanted to write about extras, about things that are forgotten, about things that go unnoticed.
I had to admit it now.
Actually it was all a lie.
I just wanted to tell my story.
<!>[The story 'Recorder of Things that will Disappear' sucks up the scattered fragments of the story.]
The sentences floating around radiated bright light and seeped into me. The fragments were randomly mixed together, telling me between the lines.
<&>「"Don’t run away, Kim Dokja."」
I didn't want to admit it. I wanted to run away. So I set up a lie.
I am a writer. This is someone who can look at this story objectively.
With those words, I ran away from my past life.
I didn't want to become Kim Dokja, so I was reincarnated as myself.
However, the reason why I did not want to become Kim Dokja in my past life was because I wanted to become Kim Dokja more than anyone else.
Because I thought I couldn’t become Kim Dokja.
I gathered all my courage and ran to the god of the other world.
The brightly shining 'Unbreakable Faith' exuded the strength of a butcher.
Almost at the same time, the guy's Excalibur also spewed fire.
At the same time as the sharp blade pierced my skin, the sword I swung also cut into its torso.
<#>【Oooooooo-】
Through the pitch-black dust, I could see him staggering back a dozen steps.
At first glance, it was a fatal wound.
Its arm no longer regenerates and its only weapon is Excalibur. At least it felt like it was difficult to hold the Excalibur.
I stumbled closer.
All I have to do is deliver the final blow. With just one final blow, I can begin to change this world.
Tsutsutsutsu-
For a moment, my vision flickered.
When I opened my eyes, my eye level had changed. I realized I was on my knees. The 'Unbreakable faith' that had lost its shine was rolling around on the floor.
A bright blue light was shining in the eyes of the founder, who was glaring at us from afar.
It was a king's tale.
Tsutsutsutsutsu-
I had no strength to resist anymore.
The founder, who was watching my movements from 20 steps away, slowly did it as a test.
He took a step.
Now nineteen steps.
<!>[The temporary channel will be restored!]
Just then, the channel opened.
It was Bihyung.
—It's out, you bastard! Damn, what is this again! No, what the hell…
Sixteen steps.
—Hey! I'll summon you right now-
"Don’t do it."
—What?
I took a deep breath, and grabbed the sword that was lying on the floor.
"I’m not going back."
At least I can't go back until I kill that guy.
I corrected myself and looked down at the floor covered in pure white snowflake ash.
I couldn't feel her story anywhere else in the world. Nevertheless.
<&>「Alive.」
I wanted to believe that. She must be alive and not dead somewhere. I couldn't bear to not believe that.
<&>「Han Sooyoung is alive here.」
Between all the lines she wrote and then erased, she remained. I said, sweeping between the lines with my palm.
"Bihyung."
I sent a short message through 'Dokkaebi Communication'. After hearing my story, Bihyung opened his mouth.
—I can't help it. It's a violation of the contract, but I'll just ignore it once. As of now, there is no big solution.
Bihyung accepted my offer.
—Instead, I will charge you twice the commission from now on.
Next, a scenario came down from thin air.
<!>[A new sub-scenario has arrived.]
Warmth began to return to the place where the story blossomed.
<!>[The 'scenario area departure penalty' is lifted.]
The cold went away and I returned to the scenario.
+
<Sub Scenario - Founder of the Absolute Throne>
Category: Sub
Difficulty : ???
Clear conditions: Kill the founder of the Absolute Throne
Time limit: —
Compensation : ???
Failure: —
+
The moment I read the scenario, I realized how ridiculous the fight I had been in was.
A nonsensical enemy that was not listed on the level of difficulty was pushed to the brink of death.
He was now eleven steps ahead.
Right now, I don't have any magic left.
Since he knows that fact, he must be secretly approaching me.
But there was one last way left for me.
Now that the channel has opened, the stars will be watching me
"I will sign a sponsor contract."
The stars in the night sky did not respond to my declaration.
The reason was quickly apparent.
<!>[The Nebula <Asgard> laughs at your judgment.]
Asgard, who had a grudge because of the previous incident, interfered.
<!>[The Nebula <Olympus> declares that if it makes a behind-the-scenes contract with the incarnation Cheon Inho, it will be hostile to some constellations.]
I smiled into the air.
Right.
Is that your choice?
Before I knew it, the god of the other world had taken nine steps forward and called my name.
<#>【Kim Dokja.】
<&>「The name is important. All stories are complete only when they are named.」
Everything in this world is made up of stories, and every story is complete only when it is given a name.
Coordinates that designate only one constellation in that vast universe. The only language that can gather the scattered light in the pitch-black night sky.
<&>「At least in this world, there is only one star that can guide me.」
A constellation that will not contain the stories I will build and will not force me into unfair contracts.
He had many names.
Eight steps.
The first one was so loud and distant that I couldn't tell exactly what it was called.
The founder's steps began to speed up.
The second name was not something I could fully accept yet.
Seven steps.
He did not exist where the third name was.
Six steps.
And there is only one last name left that I can call.
Five steps.
The moment I entered the attack radius, the founder swung Excalibur at me.
He decided that I no longer had the strength to fight back.
I opened my mouth.
<!>[Sub-skill 'Sentence Strengthening' is activated!]
<!>[You can enter your actions.]
<!>[The actions you enter will be reinforced.]
<!>[You can increase the reinforcement level by investing stocked probability.]
<!>[Current probability: 580]
Using all the probability I have.
<&>「"I will make a contract."」
He will definitely read these words.
I swung my sword with all my remaining strength.
Wow!
'Unbreakable Faith' collided with Excalibur and flew through the air.
The moment the god of another world twisted his trajectory to aim for my waist, I jumped up and swung the sword I had taken out of my back bag.
Just in time, my sword cut into his side first.
The founder looked surprised, as if he thought I had almost no energy left. His guess was true.
But he won't know. From now on, what will happen before his eyes?
<#>【Oooooh-】
The guy must have sensed something strange and walked back, gesturing at his skull.
I got sick.
I will take a step forward and take a breath. The story of the ark, overflowing from my entire body, were gathering in my blade.
<&>「That's my favorite story.」
Without hesitation, I swung my sword at the screaming guy.
The shank was trained much more neatly than the [Baekcheonganggi] I use, and it was very good on the guy's upper abdomen.
<#>【Goooooooo-】
The confused guy was trying to communicate with the other side of the veil through a link in the air.
But I had no intention of allowing that.
"Death Sword."
As I said those words, the constellations engraved on the body of the Death Sword sword began to glow one by one.
Originally, to reveal all the constellations of the 'Death Sword', seven great-level constellations were needed.
But now, it was limited to just one constellation.
The startled outer god screamed and trembled.
He is a great god of another world.
This guy wasn't afraid of the relics of the great constellations.
He recognized the story behind this sword.
<!>[The story 'King of a Kingless World' begins its storytelling.]
I cut the sword stuck in the guy's chest and split off his head.
Its body split in half and scattered with a scream.
The link was broken.
Sparks emitted in the air, and eventually the wick touched and burned like a candle with only a few moments remaining.
<!>[Sub-scenario cleared!]
<!>[The fourth main scenario has ended.]
<!>[You have achieved an achievement that does not exist]
<!>[A significant number of constellations have entered the temporary channel.]
Stars were rising one by one above the pitch black curtain.
The constellations took risks and came to the 'Great Hall' to see me.
<!>[The 'Administrative Bureau' praises your achievements.]
<!>[The 'Management Bureau' is preparing a reward appropriate for your achievements]
<!>[A new story has been acquired.]
Stars appeared in the night sky when the king disappeared. Looking up at the stars, I thought of a man who had seen the same scene as me a long time ago.
<&>「The story is still Kim Dokja’s story.」
A name I hated, hated, and loved.
<&>「But it’s still not a story for just one Kim Dokja.」
<!>[A constellation that did not reveal their modifier reveals their modifier.]
<!>[The constellation contract has been completed.]
I looked up at our star while carrying the fallen 41st Yoo Joonghyuk on my back.
The star that Yoo Joonghyuk and so many people so desperately wanted to find, the star that I thought I couldn't find, and the star that Han Sooyoung wanted to meet.
<!>[Your sponsor is the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]
