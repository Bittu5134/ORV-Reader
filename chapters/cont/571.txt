<title>571 Episode 3. Protagonist(?) (8)
After obtaining the ground rat knife, our progress accelerated.
A few times along the way, we encountered small mischiefs of ground rats, but thanks to Jung Hee-won's skill, they were easily defeated.
It wasn't long before the group was able to get their hands on one each.
I wonder how long we walked.
Finally, the scenery of Oksu Station appeared.
"Wow, really. Wow."
After walking for only 20 minutes, Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi's faces were covered in sweat.
Oksu Station is an aboveground station.
Looking at the faint sunlight, I suddenly had a thought.
<&>「I don't want to die.」
I don't know why I felt that way.
What I do know is that one day I will write this sentence.
"I'll take a look around first. You can stay here for a while."
Jung Heewon jumped forward and stepped onto the platform with light steps.
Behind me, Kyung Sein asked.
"But is it okay for us to stay here? Oksu Station is above ground."
According to Omniscient Reader, the ground is covered in a 'poisonous fog' from the second main scenario onward.
"It's okay, I don't think there are any poisonous rhinoceros around here."
The poisonous fog was the fart of the 7th grade monster species, the great poisonous rhinoceros.
In other words, as long as there were no poisonous rhinoceros nearby, there was no danger of being exposed to the poisonous fog.
Kyung Sein shook her head in admiration.
"I can't believe you remembered something like that. May I ask how many times you've read it?"
"I've read it quite a lot."
I couldn't help it. Counting rewrites and revisions, I'd read it at least a dozen times per chapter. I read some sections over a hundred times.
"You're not famous, are you? You're not one of the Seven Apostles, are you?"
"What's that?"
"It's a group created by some of the most famous persons in Omniscient Reader's world—"
For a moment, I was confused if this was fiction or reality, because there is a similar group in Omniscient Reader.
"They say the world is big and there are many reclusive masters...... I guess my luck isn't so bad after meeting Inho-ssi."
"Can I hear that story you just told in detail?"
"What story, the Seven Apostles?"
"Yes."
"Well, it's not a big deal, it's just a bunch of fans who got together and named it as a joke—"
Kyung Sein began to ramble on about the 'Seven Apostles' in a somewhat excited voice.
I was shocked that a failed novel had such a club, but I was also surprised that it was four years old.
Since this is Omniscient Reader's world, it's likely that readers with a high number of completions have survived.
If we can bring them to our side, it will be a great help.
"I was there when it happened."
As Kyung Sein was recounting the three-days and three-nights setup battle between the 'Seven Apostles' and the 'Misreading Association', Jung Heewon returned from scanning Oksu Station.
"There are no survivors, I think they've all gone to the surface."
"Thank you for your hard work."
"What should we do? Your family—"
Seeing Jung Heewon worrying about others even in the midst of this, I realized that she doesn't have to be the Judge of Destruction.
Is it necessary for her to go through that pain again only for her awakening?
There are many ways to become stronger. I can't say that the development of the main story is the only answer.
"They must be nearby, maybe coming from that direction."
I said, looking to the other side of the tracks leading to the Dongho Bridge.
I could finally meet the main characters of Omniscient Reader.
I could meet Kim Dokja, Yoo Joonghyuk, Lee Hyunsung, Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung.
I exchanged glances with Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi and walked along the tracks.
In the distance, I could see the tracks leading to Dongho Bridge. The bridge was already broken in the middle, as if the ichthyosaur had made a mess and disappeared.
We paused, stared, and waited.
The fishy smell of the Han River wafted through the air.
It was time for the people to come running.
It was time for Lee Hyunsung, Yoo Sangah, Lee Gilyoung, and Han Myungoh, who had crossed the Even Bridge created by 「Deus Ex Machina」 over the Dongho Bridge, to appear.
"That's weird, I don't see anyone—"
The moment Kyung Sein said that.
<&>「Time stopped.」
I panicked as I watched the world around me turn colorless in an instant.
If time had stopped now, there was only one reason.
The skill [■■] had been triggered.
But why?
I didn't see anyone around me who would suddenly do something unexpected?
<!>[Someone wants to do something unexpected.]
Huh?
The letters swirled around me, and a snowy landscape appeared.
<!>[The activation conditions for the exclusive skill '■■' have been partially met.]
<!>[The exclusive skill '■■' has been activated.]
What do you mean 'someone'?
<!>[You have an absurdly low understanding of that character.]
<!>[Your can't intervene in the character's actions.]
And a character I can't intervene with? Where?
<!>[Do you want to check the reader's feedback?]
I hadn't written anything, and the message was one-sided.
I decided to check the feedback first.
+
rlaehrwk37: Suddenly everyone's going to die here?
+
I felt my heart sink.
Everyone's going to die?
Here? Suddenly?
<!>[Leaving the 'Snowfield'.......]
I instinctively felt a sense of crisis. It was a writer's intuition.
I don't know what happened, but if 'Snowfield' ends here, my party and I will be wiped out. I had this premonition.
'Wait, wait a moment!'
At my shout, the disappearing snowy landscape returned.
<!>[You want to do something unexpected.]
This skill is triggered when someone wants to do something 'unexpected'.
<!>[Describe your own behavior.]
<!>[You have spent 5 probability points.]
And that, I can do.
<!>[The activation conditions for the exclusive skill '■■' have been met again.]
<!>[The exclusive skill '■■' has been reactivated.]
<!>[You have entered the 'Snowfield'.]
<!>[Describe the next action of 'Cheon Inho'.]
And a window appeared in front of my eyes.
+
# Cheon Inho's Station
■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■.......」
* At your current skill level, you can write a total of 160 additional characters.
+
<!>[You can stay in the 'Snowfield' for a total of 3 minutes.]
I quickly wrote down something along the lines of, 'Cheon Inho reacted quickly to the crisis and saved the party members.'
<!>[This story's content is vague.]
<!>[This story's reproduction success rate is 10%.]
<!>[Do you want to check the reader's feedback?]
+
rlaehrwk37 : What is it with Cheon Inho
rlaehrwk81 : You don't even know what's going on
+
No, what the hell was going on.
I decided to stay calm and take a look at my surroundings. First of all, the place I was in, the background, and the people.......
Then something caught my eye.
<&>「Cracks were spreading upward through the tunnel.」
<!>[You found a background clue.]
<!>[You can reserve additional probability in your description.]
Now I had a glimpse of what was about to happen.
I quickly typed a sentence.
<&>「At that moment, Cheon Inho noticed the collapsing ceiling. He reflexively pulled Jung Heewon, who was walking ahead of him, and shouted to the two remaining people. "Everyone, stick to the wall!" Moments later, the tunnel ceiling collapsed. In a cloud of dust, Chen Inho confirmed the fate of his colleagues. Fortunately, no one was injured.」
<!>[This story is lacking probability.]
<!>[This story's reproduction success rate is 43%.]
This time, the odds have gone up quite a bit.
<!>[Do you want to try to recreate it?]
<!>[If you fail, your group will be wiped out.]
43% chance was too vague.
I pondered.
This description is lacking probability.......
After much deliberation, I changed some of the sentences while keeping the basic framework intact.
<&>「At the risk of tearing the ligaments in right arm, Chen Inho pushed his companions back with all his strength.」
<!>[This story is lacking probability.]
<!>[This story's reproduction success rate is 67%.]
The success rate has increased.
This approach is not wrong.
I made one more edit.
<&>「At the risk of tearing the ligaments in both his arms, Chen Inho pushed his companions back with all his strength.」
<!>[This story is very plausible.]
<!>[This story's reproduction success rate is 98%.]
<!>[Do you want to check the reader's feedback?]
+
rlaehrwk37: Strong
rlaehrwk81: They're alive, but they're still screwed
+
Is this the only way?
It took a while for Kim Dokja 81 to talk, but there was no other way now.
<!>[Successfully recreating the scene.]
<!>[Leaving the 'Snowfield'.]
At the same time as the message, both of my arms swelled up greatly. I could feel my level 10 strenght expanding beyond their limits.
I immediately grabbed Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi by the waist, threw them backwards with all my might, and rolled around holding Jung Heewon.
Kwaaaaaang!
There was a loud explosion, and a terrible pain shot through both my arms.
The ceiling immediately collapsed in a cloud of white dust. Heavy debris brushed past my cheeks and arms.
When I managed to come to my senses with a few coughs, I heard a faint moan in my arms.
Jung Heewon was safe.
Dansoo ahjussi and Kyung Sein had been knocked a good distance away, but they didn't seem to be too seriously injured.
<&>「I'm alive.」
My whole body shook. My left arm didn't move as if its ligaments were broken, and my right arm could barely move, but was nearly paralyzed.
Nevertheless, it wasn't over yet.
An intermittent tremor in the ground told me that whatever had caused this collapse was approaching us.
Kukukukuku.
Moments later, a large, dark shadow loomed above the broken tunnel.
It was a monster I recognized.
7th grade monster species, the great poisonous rhinoceros.
I had a terrible feeling. This is why the feedback said that.
Even if I survive here, I'm doomed to be killed by that beast.
As the violet eyes of the one-horned rhinoceros stared at me, its massive forefoot lifted into the air.
I'll be trampled.
I tried to move, but my body wouldn't budge.
"Heewon-ssi! Wake up! Quickly!"
A black shadow covered my eyes.
This time, it was the end.
And then.
<&>「A pale trajectory sliced through the air.」
Jung Heewon's swordsmanship was amazing, but that beautiful, ecstatic trajectory was incomparable.
The severed forefoot of the poisonous rhinoceros landed beside me, bleeding unrealistically.
I watched the whole thing, covered in the beast's blood.
Then a second trajectory bloomed.
<&>「No way.」
The image of the poisonous rinhoceros horns, ears and legs being cut off one after another.
The terrifying 7th grade monster, screaming in agony, collapsed.
<&>「At this point, there shouldn't be any incarnation that can deal with that beast.」
A slow chill ran down my spine as I looked at the pitch-black's back, holding a long spear.
<&>「There is. One person.」
A man in a black coat stood over the corpse of the poisonous rhinoceros that had fallen with a roar.
Just making eye contact sent a shiver down my spine.
I didn't need anyone to tell me.
The man who carried all the world's tragedies on his back.
The hero of 'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World', the book Kim Dokja read for a decade.
"Why are you here?"
Yoo Joonghyuk.
