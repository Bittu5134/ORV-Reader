<title>670 Episode 21 Kim Dokja (6)
The 'Absolute Throne' was shining in the distance.
A seat where only one king can sit.
At one time, Han Sooyoung also wanted to sit in that seat. She believed that if she sat down there, she would be compensated for all the sorrow she had endured.
That was until she realized that even that desire was nothing more than a play for the constellations.
<!>[A significant number of constellations are aware of your presence.]
<!>[Very few constellations are concerned about your intervention.]
<!>[Some constellationsHoly Sees are requesting the Bureau to review your probability.]
She could feel the gaze of the stars across the distant sky.
Will the stars understand her story now?
<!>[A constellation that has not yet revealed its modifier is looking at you.]
What she wanted was farther and farther away than that throne.
It was so distant that she couldn't quite tell what it was.
<&>「She had no reason to intervene in this situation.」
This was the 41st round’s normal development.
Yoo Jonghyuk, in the 41st round, will take the 'absolute throne' and walk the path of a supreme king who rules over everything.
No one will be able to stand on the same level as him.
No path will arise for him.
<&>「Just leave it alone.」
If she just sat back and watched, the 41st round would end up in failure.
At the end of this story, Yoo Jonghyuk, in despair, will send Shin Yoosoung to the past.
That ends the story of this world line.
Kim Dokja will return to her again after reading all of her stories.
He has to come back.
For his sake, she must not move. Not write even a single sentence.
She has to let the characters move and flow. She knew it well. But why?
"Yoo Jonghyuk. If you sit over there, it’s all over."
Did she finally pick up the pen?
"You guessed it too, right? What the absolute throne is."
Of course, she knows the answer.
Even now, when she closes herhis eyes, the memory comes to mind clearly. It may be because she saw something she shouldn't have seen.
<&>「"What you’re trying to do is not end the story, but give up."」
Kim Dokja, whom she ignored. Kim Dokja, who did not want to be reborn as Kim Dokja again.
Nevertheless, Kim Dokja had to return to this story again.
She found Kim Dokja and that's why she's here now.
"Are you Han Sooyoung?"
Yoo Jonghyuk of the 41st round was looking at her.
Han Sooyoung asked bitterly.
"Who told you my name?"
Han Sooyoung quietly stared at the Yoo Jonghyuk from the 41st round.
"I owed you a beating last time."
This was her second fight with Yoo Joonghyuk in the 41st round.
"Do you think this time will be different?"
"It will be different."
"It looks like your learning ability is poor. If you’ve ever fought, you’d know that, right? It’s not for me."
On the rooftop of the theater dungeon, she bumped into Yoo Joonghyuk once.
She risked the odds and drew on her story, and she took advantage of the weakness of 'regressive depression' to subdue Yoo Joonghyukeok.
But is that possible this time too?
She couldn't figure it out.
"Well, you must have regressed more than 40 times."
She didn't know, so she deliberately provoked him. She tried to spy on the guy's reaction, but Yoo Joonghyuk didn't come over. His eyes, deep as the sea of ​​silk, just stared at her.
All surrounding sounds disappeared.
Tension weighing heavily on the area. Silence where not a single insect cries.
The one who moved first was Han Sooyoung.
The sound of something being pushed away was heard one step later, and hisher black spear and her white sword clashed in the air.
Her magical power and his physical power are intertwined, and a tearing sound roseises through the rain clouds.
She lost.
Kaaaaang!
A lightning-like dramatic impact weighed heavily on Han Sooyoung. Let's believe in her spirit and her skills. Yoo Jonghyuk opened his her mouth.
"It seems you also know about regression."
"So are you surprised?"
"I expected it."
Yoo Jonghyuk spoke without even raising an eyebrow.
"Because there were a lot of strange people in this round."
Strange guys. Han Sooyoung knew who he was referring to.
"Everyone said they knew me."
Her sharp emotions were buried at the end of her words. The anger of the returner who had been forged again and again was condensing.
<!>[Incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk'’s 'Spiritual Soul Height Lv.10' is activated!]
Black magical power swirled in the gravitational force of the spear.
Han Sooyoung’s expression hardened at the creepy waveform of magical power.
From now on, it's real.
Han Sooyoung took her chances and opened up her own stories.
With the sound of her striking the black flame dragon's holy soul drum, which made her called her special flame black dragonDemon Emperor, the pole pole filled with her [Earth and Soul Field] and the dot pole filled with [special flame] collided.
She was Han Sooyoung and she was confident.
Even though Yoo Joonghyuk was a powerful martial artist, there was no way he could stand up to her.
Coo coo coo coo!
A magic wave that turns one side of the sky pitch black.
The first to be pushed out was Han Sooyoung. Han Sooyoung's expression was so disgusted that she cried and swallowed the blood that came up her throat and swallowed it.
'Nonsense.'
No matter how the aftereffects of probability were, she was the one who saw the end of the scenarios twice.
The Yoo Jonghyuk floating in the sky right now was only Yoo Jonghyuk from the 41st round.
But how?
<&>「"Don’t underestimate me in the 41st round."」
One step too late, the advice of her fellow regressor came to mind.
<&>「"It’s only the 41st round, so what?"」
<&>「"His character may be different."」
This world was not even recorded in Ways of Survival.
In a sense, it is a world line that writer Han Sooyoung does not really know.
Yoo Jonghyuk lived a 41-rounds life that no one recorded.
That Yoo Jonghyuk was speaking.
"Do you know me too?"
Han Sooyoung bit her lip.
<&>「She said, "You are the one who sent Shin Yoosoung to the past because you thought you couldn’t do it alone. How strong can a guy who gave up so easily be?"」
<&>「"That’s the problem."」
<&>「"What?"」
<&>「"There is no way I could have collapsed that much in only the 41st round."」
Han Sooyoung looked at Yoo Jonghyuk. He was telling the story embedded in his whole body.
That story is proof of his life.
Han Sooyoung slowly felt a chill go down herhis spine.
<&>「"In that world line, I have given up on the possibility of the next round. I probably saw a despair that I couldn't overcome no matter how hard I tried. I concluded that I, who can return on my own, cannot see the end without sending Shin Yoosoung to another world line."」
Looking at Yoo Jonghyuk's eyes, Han Sooyoung thinks about the regressor.
Only  All the world, excluding the regressor, regresses.
The soul of the regressor continues to age and memories accumulate.
Touching and sick heart.
Endless depression and madness.
Han Sooyoung also knew.
Regression was not a curse that an ordinary human could bear, and Yoo Jonghyuk was not an ordinary human.
Steel-like mentality and unwavering spirit. Yoo Jonghyuk is a person who is so strong that he cannot be described simply as 'strong'.
A protagonist created to endure a number of 1,863 regressions.
<&>「"If I made such an extreme judgment in only the 41st round."」
The 'main character' gave up his future in only the 41st round. And he tied the future to his past self.
<&>「"That guy did his best to the point where he couldn’t survive his next life."」
"It seems you don’t know."
A story arose.
It's an endlessly cancerous and ominous story that they don't know when or how it was acquired.
Han Sooyoung thought.
Really strong. It's hard to believe that it's the 41st round. He seems stronger than any other 'Yoo Jonghyuk' who lived through the fourth scenario.
If she uses Kim Dokja Company's story, she can win. But if she does that…
<!>[The <Star Stream> is reacting to your choices.]
This time, the probability of this world will not forgive her.
Ga-ga-ga-ga-gak!
Seeing Yoo Jonghyuk's sword flying, Han Sooyoung also swung her sword in front of her.
Once, twice, three times.
Every time her spear and sword clashed, the sound of her grip being torn apart could be heard.
Her blood flowed and her nerves became numb little by little.
Four times.
Han Sooyoung finally lost her sword.
'Unbreakable Faith' broke and fell to the ground.
A moment's gap.
Yoo Jonghyuk did not hesitate. As if there was no place for her in this world, Yoo 
Jonghyuk threw out hisher spear with a cold motion.
A slow blow to the heart.
Han Sooyoung looked down at her own wounds as if she couldn't believe it, and then looked up at Yoo Joonghyuk.
That was the last time.
It was a life-threatening wound that did not need to be repeated twice.
Yoo Joonghyuk retrieved his own spear the moment after seeing Han Sooyoung had disappeared.
"It hurts, kid."
A voice came from behind.
Yoo Joonghyuk, startled, immediately tried to swing the spear backwards.
"Do you know how much memory loss there is once your avatar dies?"
Two small, soft hands wrapped around his head.
Tsutsutsutsuchut!
A dazzling spark and a terrible shock engulfed Yoo Jonghyuk's mind. Unable to withstand the aftermath, Yoo Jonghyuk's whole body trembled like an aspen tree.
The story in Han Sooyoung’s hands burrowed into Yoo Jonghyuk’s head.
<&>「"The stronger the guy, the heavier the weight of his despair."」
This is what her colleague told her.
<&>「"Probably, he will easily sink to just one feather."」
Han Sooyoung knew better than anyone else what the weakness of a regressor who experienced deep despair was.
<!>[The gaintbig story, 'Kim Dokja’s Company' begins.]
His stomach churned and his whole body trembled as if he had been shocked.
"What do happy memories taste like, you bastard?"
Memories of <Kim Dokja Company> flowed from her fingertips.
<&>「"Why is that kid so good at cooking?"」
Memories of Kim Dokja and her stealing Yoo Jonghyuk's dishes and eating them.
Memories of the picnic where <Kim Dokja’s Company> gathered together and left. In their story that had not yet ended, Kim Dokja that she remembered was speaking.
<&>「"Next time, let’s bring more beef."」
Han Sooyoung looked at the story blankly. The fact that such a time even existed now seemed unrealistic.
A person who can exist only in sentences.
The stories that were clearly her memories now seemed like lies in a novel written by someone else.
Han Sooyoung smiled as she looked at Yoo Jonghyuk's eyes that had turned white.
"I’m about to die of happiness."
Happiness. As she pronounced that word, Han Suyoung momentarily tilted her head.
What was that?
Is it because the avatar died and lost some of her memories? Han Sooyoung couldn't immediately remember the meaning of that word. Perhaps that wasn't all she had lost.
However, she trusted Han Sooyoung.
<!>[The constellation 'Lotus Flower Blooming Under the Moonlight' is watching you.]
Her companion who would remember those words for her.
<&>「"I told you I’d try to persuade you. Are you ready to be persuaded?"」
Find a writer to write her story for her.
"You damn  son of a bitch."
Han Sooyoung finally understood her own actions, muttering a phrase that she would never use.
All writers were readers before they were writers, and Han Sooyoung was the same.
I'm curious about the story he makes. Even after all that hardship, he came back to this world, and the story he wanted to tell was.
<!>[The constellation 'Lotus Flower Blooming Under the Moonlight' looks at you with sad eyes.]
So she stopped Yoo Jonghyuk.
<!>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer' bows his head.]
She acted arbitrarily without consulting with other members of <Kim Dokja’s Company>.
"You think so too, Yoo Jonghyuk?"
Maybe because of her choice, she knew that all the plans she had made could go wrong.
Taking a light breath, Han Sooyoung lifted the stunned Yoo Jonghyuk onto her shoulder.
She didn't have much time left now.
Yoo Jonghyuk will wake up soon.
In the meantime, she must destroy the 'Absolute Throne'.
Only then will this scenario end.
<&>「But there was something she didn’t know.」
Han Sooyoung suddenly felt the hairs on the back of her hand stand up.
With a deafening sound, she heard the strange sound of a huge scale tipping from somewhere.
Han Sooyoung immediately realized what was happening. She has participated in this scenario on other floating ships, so it is unlikely that the abnormality she caused would lead to a riot, but she did not expect the fallout to take this form.
The probability was running wild.
Han Sooyoung opened her mouth without realizing it. She knew this feeling well.
"The 'Great Hall' opens."
A huge hole was opening beyond the black swirling sky.
<!>[The gods of this world have noticed your presence!]
<!>[The scales of probability are in equilibrium.]
The owner of the 'Absolute Throne' was appearing beyond the 'Great Hall of the Sky'.


















More exactly, she knew but she forgot.
Not long ago, when she met Lee Hakhyun, 
she gave Lee Hakhyun the Ways of Survival she knew.
'That bastard. I don't know if he'll be alive.'
Lee Hakhyun wants to write the story of this world on her behalf.
Therefore, she gave him the most important story she knew.
Oooooooooooo-
The fear of something once known becoming unknown.
But Han Sooyoung was not affected by that fear. Even if she forgot the story, she was still a great writer.
The air rang menacingly. Looking at the shadows swaying beyond the hall, Han Sooyoung was vaguely able to gauge the level of 'God of the Other World'.
It wasn’t as crazy as the 'indescribable distance ' or the 'disaster' of the  999th round.
It was clear that it was at least at the level of the dream eater, and perhaps it was more than that.
Coo coo coo coo coo.
If that thing descends over Seoul, the Korean Peninsula will be destroyed. It's not just the Korean Peninsula. Maybe the Earth will become a ruin.
Nevertheless, Han Sooyoung made a shameless voice.
"Don’t bluff. You won’t be able to get over it."
As if, of course, such an ending would not come.
"Yes?"
The question was not directed to the constellations of the Emperor, nor to the incarnations on earth.
"Are you going to let it destroy your playground?"
The next moment, a portal was created in an ambiguous space neither on the ground nor in the sky.
What appeared beyond the comma-like portal was a gentleman in a black suit.
A being who refers to himself as 'Representative Kim Dokja'.
Han Sooyoung knew his true name.
"Asmodeus."
Representative Kim Dokja frowned with a light spark.
Han Sooyoung's eyes showed a strange light.
<!>[Predictive plagiarism.]
Every sentence she read and wrote was projected onto her eyes, telling her who the being in front of her was.
"How long do you plan on playing Kim Dokja?"
<!>[You...]
The 32nd master of the demon world, Asmodeus, the demon king of rage and lust.
In Han Sooyoung's world line, he is clearly the demon king who was destroyed by Kim Namwoon in the 999th round.
<!>[It looks like you've already lost a lot of your memory, but my name must have been quite important, right?]
Asmodeus looked at the sparks flowing through Han Sooyoung’s whole body.
Her memories were shattering through the sparks.
"I remember it well."
<!>[You are no longer the Han Sooyoung I met before.]
Han Sooyoung held out her hand.
"Shut up and give me the 'Death Sword' you have."
She doesn't know which world it is from, but in the last fight, Asmodeus used that sword to cut her avatar link.
"If you give it to me, I’ll give you what you want."
Han Sooyoung thought. All she has to do is somehow take away someone else's sword and cut off the Constellation's link that is bound to the 'Absolute Throne'.
Then, the 'God of the Other World' will lose its connection with this world, and its descent will naturally be cancelled.
To do this, she first had to persuade Asmodeus in front of her.
<!>[Do you know what I want?]
"You don’t want this world line to proceed as it should."
From the first time she faced Asmodeus, Han Sooyoung kept scoring goals.
<&>「Why did Asmodeus move from the 3rd round to the 41st round?」
Why did he find an unrecorded world line, rather than another world line, and live as a parasite?
<&>「Asmodeus wanted Kim Dokja, but was never able to obtain it.」
<&>「Asmodeus used Han Myeongoh’s daughter as his incarnation.」
<&>「Asmodeus wanted to leave his name in the great legend.」
<&>「Asmodeus was a seeker of the end.」
Countless information related to Asmodeus flowed through her mind in real time. [Predictive plagiarism] was triggered, and her consciousness flooded her mind, analyzing, synthesizing, and mixing the information.
<&>「Asmodeus is a character who read 'Ways of Survival'.」
Han Sooyoung blinked slowly and asked.
"How did it feel to find out the identity of the world?"
Asmodeus' expression gradually hardened.
The moment she saw that expression, Han Sooyoung read the other side of that expression at once.
"You didn’t just read Ways of Survival."
Eyes that are slightly but clearly shaking.
Han Sooyoung was sure.
Asmodeus didn't just read Ways of Survival. This guy read up to Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint.
He read every sentence written for Kim Dokja and even confirmed his own death written there.
Of course, Asmodeus was not the only one who experienced such a thing. <Kim Dokja’s Company> also went through all of that.
However, Asmodeus was not <Kim Dokja’s Company>.
<!>[What does that mean?]
He has never valued Kim Dokja, and has never dreamed of ending up with him. If such a demon king came to this world line, the reason was clear.
"You want to get out of our story, don’t you?"
<!>[…]
"But if you stop me here, this world line will be doomed."
The course of this world is not written down, but the future is certain.
In the 41st round, Yoo Jonghyuk fails and the world line is destroyed.
And the incident in which Yoo Jonghyuk took the 'absolute throne' was the beginning of that destruction.
"You don’t want that either, do you? So help me. Let’s cooperate for a moment and I will destroy that throne, so give me the Death Sword you have."
<!>[I don’t know what your plan is.]
After a while, Asmodeus opened his mouth.
<!>[Why are you changing the plot now? Your purpose was to 'make this world met it’s end'.]
"…"
<!>[Only then will your world line be safely preserved, because what you are looking for is 'Kim Dokja'’s return.]
Han Sooyoung was surprised. Because she never thought that Asmodeus would already know this far.
<!>[Is it because you saw that fragment? It is the 'fragment of Kim Dokja that you have ignored and thrown away'.]
"You are a bit noisy today. So are you going to give the sword to me or not?"
<!>[That's funny. Why are you now paying attention to Kim Dokja, whom you abandoned? It wasn't the 'Kim Dokja' you wanted, was it?]
"If you say one more word-"
<!>[Isn’t the Kim Dokja you want, the Kim Dokja who was the 'Demon King of Salvation'?]
With the words of Asmodeus, stories arose around him.
<!>[He is the watcher of light and darkness.]
Kim Dokja ended the Holy Demon War and became the 'Watcher of Light and Darkness'.
<!>[He was the successor to 'The Prisoner of the Golden Headband'.]
<?>Right, I think have a definite evidence that it is the Prisoner of the Golden Headband here.<!>[And finally dreaming of this world. He has become this world itself.]
Kim Dokja, who remained in the subway when everyone else had left, became the Oldest Dream.
<!>[Are you going to gather all those Kim Dokjas? Do you think such a thing is possible?]
"…"
<!>[Since you use avatars, you probably know this better than anyone else.]
Han Sooyoung closed her mouth.
The ones who got angry on behalf of Han Sooyoung were the other members of <Kim Dokja’s Company>.
<!>[The constellation 'Lotus Blooming Under the Moonlight' glares at Asmodeus.]
<!>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer' spits out quiet anger.]
Asmodeus spoke as if mocking <Kim Dokja’s Company>.
<!>[Are you still willing to face Kim Dokja’s illusion?]
Kim Dokja of one hundred percent cannot exist. Just as she is not a 100% person now.
It wasn't a matter of whether she used an avatar or not.
All humans lose their memories every moment and become slightly different beings. The very word 100 percent was an illusion from the beginning.
So what exactly is the 'Kim Dokja' they are after?
<!>[Or is it the will of the story that lies within you?]
Han Sooyoung looked down at her palm. It was the hand who wrote the story.
There was a story embedded in that hand.
<!>[How are you different from the constellations you hated so much now?]
It continued to tell her story on her behalf.
<!>[The story 'Kim Dokja’s Company' looks at you.]
<Kim Dokja’s Company> was a story of people who loved Kim Dokja.
It was a story about people who gathered together for Kim Dokja and were happy only because of him.
Therefore, those who had this story inevitably had no choice but to find Kim Dokja.
"It’s already past the point where we have to consider such things."
Han Sooyoung clenched her fist filled with stories.
"Of course I know that there is no such thing as a 100% Kim Dokja."
There is no way she wouldn’t know that.
There is no way that the woman who wrote this story, and her colleagues who lived the story together, did not know that fact.
<!>[But why do you repeat such foolish things? Why are you continuing a story that will fail?]
When they lose someone, humans go through several stages to accept the loss.
They despair over the fact that that person will never come back, but they soon come to accept that fact, and eventually live a life after his absence.
They understand that this is the natural order of the world.
That's what ordinary mourning is like.
The problem is that neither Kim Dokja nor they were ordinary human beings.
"Because I know Kim Dokja’s story."
Kim Dokja has been brought back from the dead several times.
Was the revived Kim Dokja really the same Kim Dokja as before?
If a human being, once disassembled into particles, is reassembled, will he or she be the same person as before?
Han Sooyoung did not know the answer to such a philosophical question.
However, Kim Dokja died for his companions, again and again.
He survived to protect his companions.
That “will” was Kim Dokja.
It was a story called Kim Dokja.
<!>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer' nods.]
The story lacked probability. There were many loopholes and the flow was not smooth. It was full of holes here and there.
<!>[The constellation 'Lotus Flower Blooming Under the Moonlight' closes its eyes.]
Such stories protected <Kim Dokja’s Company>.
He gave everything of himself and completed the ending in which everyone in the group survived.
There was no way that those who had been saved like that would be able to do anything like ordinary mourning. Those who had witnessed miracles before their eyes over and over again, and those who had survived through such stories, had no intention of meekly accepting the end.
Just as Kim Dokja tried to protect all of <Kim Dokja’s Company>, <Kim Dokja’s Company> has no choice but to find all Kim Dokja.
"Like you said, we might fail in the end."
Even if their choice now means entering a never-ending cycle.
Even if the story for only one person continues far away
If it is for Kim Dokja,
"Then we will continue to fail. That is how we honor Kim Dokja."
They will be the 'characters' of this story forever and ever.
