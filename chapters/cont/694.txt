<title>694 Episode 24 Expert (4)
How is the <Asgard> in the 41st round related to the 'Demon King of Salvation'?
Do they know?
Did they find out the information through readers?
There was little chance of that happening, as most of what the readers say from 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' has probably been filtered.
Or the giant nebula that killed Kim Dokja some time ago.
There is a possibility that it was <Asgard>.
However, even if Odin, the 'One-Eyed Father', is the strongest in <Asgard>, would it be possible to kill Kim Dokja?
Shit. You must have seen a mythical constellation.
To be honest, I don't understand either hypothesis right now.
In the first place, I was convinced that the 'demon king' they were talking about was Kim Dokja.
I held my breath and focused on the conversation between the two people.
"Christina, so that’s why you were so polite to Cheon Inho-ssi—."
"That's right."
Christina, reflected in the rear-view mirror, twitched her lips as if disapproving.
"He smells like a demon king. I didn’t feel it at all at first, but after he fainted and woke up, I definitely sensed it."
"So, does this mean that incarnation Cheon Inho is a member of the Demon King’s family?"
"Probably. Not long ago, when the Demon King’s symbol appeared in Las Vegas, I faced one. The same goosebumps I felt back then were conveyed to me."
By nature, hypnotists and other psychics have a much better sense of energy than other incarnations.
It wouldn't be strange to say that Christina Page, who considered herself to be the best among them, could read the demon king's unique energy.
Anyway, Kim Dokja is also half a demon king.
"If it is a demon king, which of the 72 demon kings would it be?"
"I don’t know that."
"Have you had any other contact from <Asgard>?"
"Not at all. After that question, the messages stopped."
The two people glanced in my direction and from then on continued their conversation without speaking.
<!>[Group chat.]
It looks like there's a story that no one should hear.
In the silence that follows, all that is visible outside is a barren desert landscape. I spent my time thinking about future scenarios in my head or observing my sleeping face while snoring.
As I keep looking at this face, it now seems like my real face.
But does It look like a fraudster like that?
But Yoosoung told me I was handsome...
Would it be a good idea to buy a skill like [Humidity Preservation] like Kim Dokja, or to change the atmosphere a bit by obtaining story fragments such as [Casanova's Face]?
Come to think of it, it seems like Kim Dokja is also secretly very thorough in self-management.
You can tell he was concerned about the turtle neck just by looking at the fact that he put a pillow on his neck for a short period of time.
...Neck pillow?
I felt a strange feeling for a moment, so I looked up the item.
+
<Item information>
Name: SSS grade neck pillow
Grade: SSS
Description: This is a 'neck pillow' made by the mass-produced manufacturer. It is characterized by a cute dokkaebi face drawing.
Users of this pillow do not have any dreams and can enjoy a recovery effect comparable to consuming the essence of Elaine Forest at bedtime.
When a dangerous situation occurs, the [Alarm] function is activated to force the user to wake up.
*This item belongs to incarnation Cheon Inho.
+
It was obvious with whose coin this person bought the pillow.
Even though it was just a pillow, I looked up the price thinking how much it would cost and my eyes almost popped out.
<!>[The price of this item is 10,000 coins.]
After thoroughly checking the refund policy and return procedures for the dokkaebi bag, I decided to charge Kim Dokja the amount.
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is activated.]
—Phew, I slept well.
What amazing timing.
I fired off questions in quickly.
'When did you buy this pillow?'
—Just before I went to sleep.
'Try to convince me. Before I get really angry.'
Kim Dokja, who had already finished understanding the situation, rolled his eyes.
He started talking.
—Humans spend one-third of their day sleeping.
'Now we don’t have to sleep that much.'
—This is an item that Yoo Jonghyuk and Yoo Sangah also used.
Yoo Jonghyuk used this item?
This item with a cute dokkaebi face drawn on it?
—That kid is so popular that someone must have given it to him as a gift. Anyway, it's a useful item for us. We faint a lot.
'So?'
—Be sure to support your neck before you fall. If you get a concussion, it's a big deal.
'…'
—And read the options carefully. It is said that it has a similar effect to consuming the essence of Elaine Forest when sleeping.
I calculated it in my head.
'Elain Forest's Spirit' costs 500 coins each.
That means.
—Even if you use it just 20 times, you get your money's worth.
'How many times can I use it?'
—Well. If you use it sparingly, wouldn’t it be able to be used for quite a long time? It says here that after-sales service is also provided.
'I admit. I forgive you for your sins.'
This was a very efficient item, right?
I feel good knowing that I once again made a satisfactory purchase.
After sleeping well, Kim Dokja stretched lightly and looked out the window.
I turned around.
Slowly, the city of Las Vegas was appearing.
<!>[The seventh 'main scenario' is currently in progress.]
<!>[The eighth 'main scenario' is currently in progress.]
A series of system messages appeared.
I was puzzled.
The seventh scenario hasn't even been completed, but the eighth  scenario is in progress?
—There was something like this in the 3rd round too.
I remember too. While the fourth scenario was in progress, part of the fifth scenario, the 'Disaster' scenario, was solved.
However, it was a temporary situation at that time, and the two main scenarios did not unfold simultaneously like they do now.
Something seems wrong.
Kim Dokja also nodded in agreement.
'The seventh would be a monster invasion scenario, what would the eighth be?'
For reference, Korea's eighth scenario in the third round was 'The Strongest Scapegoat'.
—That was the third round in Korea. I don't know what it's like here.
'That's right.'
The 'Strongest Sacrifice' scenario is an extreme scenario that ends only when half of the incarnations in the area die or when the strongest incarnation dies.
I hope it will be a smooth scenario in the 41st round.
"We’ve arrived. You’re already up."
"Thanks to you, I slept well."
Selena Kim laughed at Kim Dokja's sly answer.
The entrance to the casino hotel, the symbol of Las Vegas, began to be visible in the distance.
I guess it's because it's still daytime. The hotel street, with the lights off, had a somewhat eerie atmosphere for a gambling mecca.
<!>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' wipes his head with a curious expression.]
<!>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' shakes his head saying that these buildings are not clean.]
<!>[The constellation 'King Heungmu' boasts that they cannot imitate the architectural style of the Korean Peninsula.]
<!>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' holds his tongue as he looks at the constellations on the Korean Peninsula.]
Well, the whole world has already become a gambling den for constellations, so how meaningful is it to see a human gambling den?
Christina parked her car in front of the largest hotel on Casino Street.
This is the home of Zarathustra.
When the doorman who came to greet us opened the car door, a crowd of people gathered at the entrance of the casino hotel was noticed. A mixed group of people of various races, each with their own weapons.
Kim Dokja asked with a grin.
"Am I not a welcome guest?"
"It’s not our group."
Selena Kim and Christina stood in front of Kim Dokja as if guarding him.
When I saw  it, I was a bit puzzled because the local situation on the American side was never revealed in the main story.
But Kim Dokja already knew who they were.
—It looks like the Las Vegas civil war is not over yet.
'Do you know who it is?'
—Las Vegas gang.
Is it like the American ironclad faction?
—It's a much more elite organization than those guys.
'But there is an absolute throne in America too, right? The unification of forces would have been achieved.'
—Have you already forgotten what we did?
It occurred to me later that Kim Dokja killed the founder of the absolute throne.
What if America’s 'absolute throne' also lost its effectiveness like the one in Korea did?
Now that the throne's absolute power has disappeared, it is naturally useless.
—Anna must be having a headache too.
Naturally, it is a powerful force that fills the place where the throne has disappeared.
A powerful force that can claim to be the king.
Before we knew it, the leader of the group approached us.
A long fur coat and a T-shirt with a skull on it. A cross necklace shining in silver. A Hispanic man wearing a cowboy hat that looked like something out of a western movie. Even at a glance, he was giving off an unusual vibe.
"Who are you?"
When Kim Dokja asked, Selena Kim answered.
"Jacob Martinez. King of North Las Vegas."
When the man got close enough, Selena Kim took a step forward and said,
"Mr. Martinez."
The man responded, nodding his head towards Selena Kim.
"It’s been a while. Guardian of the King."
"What’s going on here?"
"I came to see the prophet."
It looks like Anna Croft has some business to do over there, just like us. Judging by the ghastly atmosphere, it didn't seem like the visit was for good reasons.
Christina, who was watching the situation, intervened.
"I’m sorry, but Anna has plans today. Why don’t you come next time?"
"Get out of the way."
"If it’s urgent, tell me what you want. I’ll tell her."
Martinez glared at Christina with a cold gaze.
"We have come to demand compensation."
"Compensation? What compensation?"
"Our group suffered too much damage during the subjugation of the 4 grade monster species. We demand compensation for that."
4th grade 4. It seems that a similar level of monster species has appeared in the United States as well.
"The damage was all the same."
"We lost our entire home. It’s because your masterful touts guided the direction of the 'disaster' to the northern part of Las Vegas."
"It’s not Anna’s fault. Even Anna can’t do anything about a natural disaster."
"Are you saying the prophet couldn’t read the future?"
"Hey."
"She must have seen the northern part of Las Vegas flying away with her vision of the future. Yet the prophet did not give us any indication."
"…"
"If the response had been a little late, all the women and children would have been swept away to death."
Before I knew it, Kim Dokja and I were listening attentively to the two people's argument.
Anna must have had her own reasons for not telling them everything about the future.
But if someone else dies in return, whose responsibility is it?
How much responsibility does a prophet who knows the future bear for not telling the future she knows?
Christina answered with a frown.
"I'll discuss compensation and coin support. So, leave at this point. Unless you want to make a big deal out of it."
"I guess I need to meet the Prophet."
With a clanking sound, Martinez pulled out his pistol from its holster. At the same time, the group guarding him also pointed their weapons in this direction.
If this continues, a large-scale armed conflict is expected.
But Christina didn't look nervous. There was already a pocket watch in her right hand.
Martinez said.
"I already know about your hypnotism skills."
"..."
"Would it be faster for your watch to tick? Or would it be faster for my bullet to blow a hole in your head?"
"You can try it now—"
Everything happened in an instant.
Was it first that I heard the sound of a fur coat flapping, or that the person who had been the doorman a moment ago transformed into Martinez?
Front and left. The two Martinezes opened their mouths at the same time.
"You seem to have forgotten who I am, hypnotist."
Before we knew it, Martinez's pistol was touching Christina's left eyebrow. Biting her lip, Christina slowly dropped her watch, holding both of her hands above her head.
I asked, somewhat impressed by Martinez's skills.
'How did he do it? Avatar?'
<!>[Avatar is the author’s unique skill.]
So, is Martinez also a 'writer'?
—That guy is a 'magician'.
Magician?
"Hypnotist, I am going to kill you from now on."
"Martinez, wait a minute."
"If anyone moves, I will shoot immediately."
Martinez, who glared at Selena Kim, added as if warning.
"I’ll count to three. If your leader is really a 'prophet', she will come out on her own. She would have read the future where her subordinates will die."
Martinez immediately started counting to three. A cold count without any hesitation.
However, even when the count reached 1, Anna Croft did not appear.
"It seems the prophet’s name was fake. Otherwise—"
The trigger was pulled.
"She didn’t value you at all."
And there was someone who moved a little faster than the trigger.
"Anna won’t come out."
As expected, everything happened in a split second.
No, it was probably a long and leisurely time, even though it only lasted a moment.
Kim Dokja slowly raised his arm and gently wrapped the end of the pistol as if holding a teacup.
"She can’t see the future right now."
Nevertheless, no one except me could witness his actions.
Christina, Selena Kim, and Martinez all looked shocked.
A face of disbelief as to how on earth this was possible.
<!>[The constellation 'Humanity’s First Magician' is astonished.]
Only I knew the method used by Kim Dokja.
It was neither skills nor magic.
<!>[The story 'The Stone and I' ends.]
Martinez came to his senses late and urgently pulled the trigger.
Click. Click.
But the pistol did not fire.
<!>[The story of 'The Pistol and I' continues.]
Kim Dokja snatched the pistol at once and pulled the trigger into the air as if he was joking.
"Because I came."
With a bang, a congratulatory shot rang out announcing our debut in Las Vegas.
