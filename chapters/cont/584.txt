Episode 6. Star Relic
When I still didn't know much about web novels, I briefly attended a web novel academy
because of Ji Eunyoo's recommendation.
The instructor was a writer who flavored a generation of genre literature.
He had a quiet, nervous voice and spoke very slowly, which is why I dozed off during the entire
class.
However, one thing he said stuck with me.
"Don't hesitate to include chances, the more the merrier. Give them to the main character."
The instructor who used to live by those words disappeared from my life. I often imagined that
maybe he transmigrated to the novel he wrote.
Just like me now.
"I-I-it's real! Inho-ssi! It's real!"
"It is."
Who would have thought that I would be the one to retrieve the chance.
Kyung Sein let out a scream of delight, shaking the box and turning it upside down several times.
"How did you know? It doesn't say anything about this in Omniscient Reader!"
To be honest, I was just as confused.
This box was an item in the 'preliminary manuscript' of chapter 23 of Omniscient Reader.
<&>「An item described in the manuscript that was left out on draft 2.」
Anyway, the settings existed, so I looked it up just in case, and the item was indeed there.
Here's the question.
If this were setting for 'Ways of Survival', then of course Kim Dokja would have used this box in
the original novel.
However, since Kim Dokja didn't use it, it means that this 'box' is not mentioned in the text of
'Ways of Survival'.
So since when has this setting been around?
From the moment I thought of it? From the moment Han Sooyoung handed me the manuscript?

The more I thought about it, the more my head spun.
Is this really the '41st round' of the Ways of Survival that I know?
I don't know.
For now, we have the item, so let's just think about that.
I replied to Kyung Sein.
"It just occurred to me that this box was originally an item made by a dokkaebi and then
discarded."
The box, which was dangerous enough to unbalance the scenario, was once an item in the
Bureau designed by a mad dokkaebi.
"Uh...... that's right?"
"But did they really just dump that one item...... only one in the same place?"
"Wow, really. Wow."
After hearing my explanation, Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi each grabbed their knifes and
started poking around the floor.
Of course, they wouldn't find another box.
There are only two of these box.
<!>[Some constellations are shocked to discover the existence of the item.]
<!>[A few constellations protest, asking when they released such an item.]
<!>[A very small number of constellations start to point out the probability problem.]
A few constellations started to protest, but Bihyung doesn't seem to have gotten the memo.
I wondered what would happen if we closed the channel and ran away like in the original story,
but I was glad.
I needed to see the reactions of the constellations.
<!>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is interested in your luck.]
<!>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' asks if that box is real.]
<!>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' widens its eyes in disbelief.]
In this world, there are countless 'readers', including me.
From what I've learned in the fight against the Misreading Association, readers are possessing
not only incarnations, but also constellations.
<!>[The constellation 'Primordial Cow' taps its chin with its forefoot.]
I looked carefully at the indirect messages from the constellations.
If any of them were readers, they would surely unwittingly drop clues.
<!>[The constellation 'Pig Living in a Brick House' piles up bricks.]
<!>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier tells you to enter the box.]

I observed each subsequent message, trying to figure out who they were.
One that looks like a normal constellation.
One that looks like it was possessed by a reader.
One I couldn't tell if it was a reader or a constellation.
One that is possessed by a reader, but remains true to the concept of a constellation.
One that is possessed by a reader that doesn't understand the concept of constellations.
Just plain weird and so on.
Of course, this is all speculation on my part.
But hey, what can you really tell from one line of indirect messages?
They've all been reading Omniscient Reader so it shouldn't take much to convince for them to act
like constellations.
By the way...... Where's Sneaking Schemer?
I was most curious about that guy's reaction.
"I guess that's the only box, I can't find anything else."
Apparently, Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi were still digging.
"Ugh...... well, we have one. It's too bad we don't have a Broken Faith, because that's all we need
for Unbroken Faith!"
As Kyung Sein said, we would only need that, but I couldn't get my hands on a Broken Faith
right away.
So I made a decision.
"I've been thinking about it, and since we're at this point, why don't we try something different?"
"Something different?"
I pulled out an item I had just gotten from near the box.
+
<Item information>
Name: Unformed Idea
Rating: D
Description: A shapeless weapon of the past. It could have been anything, but ultimately became
nothing.
+
An item that, at first glance, looks like spoiled jelly.
"If you don't mind, I was wondering if I could put this item in."

"This is...... Isn't this an item that didn't appear in Omniscient Reader?"
Right. It's probably not used in Ways of Survival either.
Kim Dokja wasn't particularly interested in this item either.
Kyung Sein glanced at the Unformed Idea and said.
"Well, we wouldn't have found the box if it weren't for you, Inho-ssi, so it's up to you."
Dansoo ahjussi nodded.
"I think so too."
"Wow, we're becoming a bit like the 'Kim Dokja's Company', aren't we?"
"Haha, I guess so."
The two of them conceded so readily, I almost felt rather sorry.
"Thank you then."
Without further ado, I put 'Unformed Idea' into the 'random item box'.
<!>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier says it's a risky choice.]
I know it's a risky choice.
But there was a chance of failure no matter what I put in there in the first place.
"Now I need to get the starting material......."
"That's the core of a demon species, right?"
"Yes."
In order to use the box like in the original, we need to put the target item and the Demon Species
Core together.
Unfortunately, we failed to hunt the Dark Keeper, a 7th grade demon species.
For now, it's best to use the auction to get one...... but I don't know what kind of madman would
risk a demon king curse to hunt a demonic species from the beginning.
<!>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' asks if you need a 'Demon Species Core'.]
We look up in surprise.
What was even more surprising was its next words.
<!>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' says that it can give you the 'Demon Species Core'.]
Kyung Sein, who was looking at the air with us, asked in a reminiscent voice.
"Rice Cake-Eating Tiger is the one from the traditional fairy tale, right? 'The Sun and the
Moon'......."

I nodded.
Because that's the only fairy tale that comes to mind when I think of Korean 'Rice Cake-Eating
Tigers'.
<!>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' says it's him.]
constellation.]
Peninsula.]
To get an item sponsored by a constellation from the beginning. Even Kim Dok-ja had never
received such a sponsorship at this time.
If he's sponsoring items so early on, he has a reason to do so.
'Demon Species Core'.]
As I said.
"I appreciate the offer, but......."
Normally, this kind of deal would be followed by a ridiculous request.
That's Kim Dokja's proverb.
Zodiacs Ball' later.]
Twelve Zodiacs Ball?
<!>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' says it's just a twelve zodiacs social event.]
This was another unexpected suggestion.
Twelve Zodiacs Ball.
It's probably the zodiacal version of the 'Constellation Banquet' or the 'Gourmet Association'.
As they listened to the message, Kyung Sein and ahjussi whispered.
"Wow, it's the <Twelve Zodiacs>......."
"They're the rat, cow, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, chicken, dog, and pig.
Right?
"That's...... right."
"When I was young, there was a cartoon movie with twelve zodiacs as the main characters......."
In the original version of the Omniscient Reader, the constellations of the nebula <Twelve
Zodiacs> were the enemies of Kim Dokja.
But this time, the situation is a little different.

Is it because I'm a villain?
<!>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' says there's no need to feel pressured.]
I've made my decision.
"I'll attend the Twelve Zodiacs Ball. Is that really all I have to do?"
<!>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' says that's really it.]
"Okay, then."
<!>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' is greatly pleased.]
<!>[A '7th grade Demon Species Core' has been sponsored.]
It was a very cool sponsorship.
A pitch black colored orb then appeared from thin air.
'7th grade Demon Species Core'.
It was even superior in color.
Tsuchuchuchut.
Judging from the faint sparks, it seemed that 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' had taken quite the
probability.
What is he up to showing such sincerity to me when I'm not even his own incarnation?
<!>[The constellation 'Primordial Cow' is sharing the probability of 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger'.]
Tiger'.]
Cake-Eating Tiger'.]
<!>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' claps his hands at the animal brothers.]
Anyway, thanks to the animal friends, I have been gathered all the ingridients.
Looking at the glowing core, Kyung Sein said excitedly.
"Oh, go ahead and put it in, Inho-ssi!"
"Why don't the three of us cover it at the same time?"
"Okay."
We covered the box.
Kyung Sein chanted.
"God! Buddha! Demon King of Salvation! Please!"
A moment later, a bright light emanated from the box.

*
A place dozens of steps away from the core of the 'Edge of Darkness'.
In the center of the deep, black ether of the 'Dark Root', a woman in a white coat stood.
"Wow......."
She frowned at the 'random item box' glowing in the distance.
"Even the box was taken? From me? Is that even possible?"
<!>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' ask why didn't you move faster.]
"Who's that guy?"
<!>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' says he seems to be a reader from another world line.]
"A reader?"
<!>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' says yes.]
The woman tilted her head at that, then smiled, baring her fangs.
"Not a guy?"
In her hand was a 'Broken Faith' that no reader in this world could have gotten.
