<title>785 Episode 37 Graduation ceremony (1)
<&>「The ending of 『Infinite Instructor』 is unknown. Because it was never written down.」
***
A lightning bolt struck Killer King as he roamed the forest. Then, a high-level demon fell down with a thud.
"Oh! Another one!"
"That’s amazing."
As Kyung Sein and Lee Dansu cheered, Cha Yerin shook her head.
Killer King shrugged and shook his shoulders at the group’s reaction
"It’s nothing."
The ability to defeat a 'high-level demon' without even a single scratch. What was more surprising was,
"A word is enough for those guys."
Killer King really defeated them with just 'a few words'.
Killer King’s method of defeating the high-level demons was simple.
"Judging by your appearance, your original form must have been insignificant."
<@>[W-what nonsense are you talking about! What do you know about me—]
Tsutsutsut!
"If you're so confident, reveal your true identity."
<@>[I'm from the great <Olympus>— Egegegege! Why, why— Gegegegegegege!]
Tsutsutsutsut!
The name of this worldview is 『Infinite Instructor』. Every character here has their own role, and therefore can only speak within the established categories.
Simply put, in this worldview, speech that doesn't fit the worldview's composition is not permitted.
What happens if you ignore the worldview and keep speaking?
<@>[Egegegegegegege!]
That's what happens.
"Wow, my goodness."
At first, she thought it was luck.
But then, one, two, three, four of the high-level demons who fell like that... Soon, when they surpassed ten, Kyung Sein's eyes filled with awe.
"Here, kill... no, Kang Ilhoon is the strongest."
Killer King snorted as he watched Kyung Sein, who couldn't hide his admiration.
"They're weak and lost."
In this worldview, the trait given to Killer King was 'Delusionist', and the delusionist was the only being in this worldview who could 'say anything'. It didn't matter whether he directly mentioned the <Star Stream> or the true names of the constellations.
Everything he said was 'delusion'.
How many demons had he tormented with probability like that?
"Everyone, get out."
For the first time, a high-level demon who didn't become a probability roaster appeared due to Killer King's provocation. It wasn't because he was strong.
<!>[The restraining power of the worldview is weakening!]
The restraining power of probability in this world was weakening.
He didn't know why.
Was it because he exploited the trait of the worldview?
The next moment, a light flashed in the distance and the sky opened up. Even the running Killer King, Cha Yerin, Kyung Sein, and Lee Dansu, were speechless for that moment and looked up at the sky.
Constellations were falling from the universe beyond the sky.
The high-level demons who had been chasing th em fell to the ground, and from somewhere, a huge probability aftershock was heard.
It was a scene that made both the delusional and non-delusional people think of the same name for that moment.
"Kim Dokja."
They muttered, not even knowing who that name was calling anymore.

rlaehrwk37: It's finally starting
***
I wrote a graduation speech as a valedictorian in high school. As it turned out, I was the winner of the 100-day award that year, and I was chosen as the valedictorian. The Korean teacher's comment when he first read my speech is still vivid.
"You wrote it well, but um. What should I say... You should write it like yourself. Don't you think so?"
"Like me? What is that?"
"You want to be a writer?"
Was it because of my nineteen-year-old self, or was it because of my teacher's provocation?
When I first heard that question, I had a strange attitude from the beginning.
What is being like me?
How does that person know what is 'like me' in the first place?
The question I had at that time naturally became forgotten as time passed. It wasn't that I forgot after finding the answer. I forgot naturally because I was too busy, or because I made excuses that I was past the age to ask such questions.
Now, more than ten years later, I felt like I knew the answer I had been searching for for so long that day.
That's what being like me is.
A Demon King with a similar appearance to me. A pale face was there.
He was a being from the same roots as me. A constellation who loved stories more than anyone else in the world. My sponsor and my hyung. The one who told me who Kim Dokja was.
I opened my mouth to him.
"Hyung, let's stop now."
Even as I said that, I already knew the answer I would get. I answered before hearing the answer.
"...If I could really stop just by saying that—"
"This story wouldn't have even started in the first place."
Watching him insist on answering, I felt that he was still my sponsor.
We smiled at each other.
"You look terrible."
"Hmm. You've gotten taller, haven't you?"
"You are actually satisfied with your own face?"
"It's not bad in the bathroom."
I thought about my sponsor, the 'Demon King of Salvation.' Not the Demon King of Salvation who repeats the same sacrifices every time in 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint', but the Demon King of Salvation I know.
For example, the awkward greeting we exchanged when we first met.
<&>「Hello.」
I still remember that tone of voice that didn't sound like Kim Dokja at all. He was someone who was subtly different from the Kim Dokja I remembered from 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint'.
I learned a lot from him.
<&>「Do you know Ways of Survival?」
I read the long and boring 'Ways of Survival' through his relic.
<&>「Phew, I slept well.」
I learned the shamelessness of buying a pillow with someone else's coins and resting.
<&>「Okay, let's go check out the back of Joonghyuk's head in the 41st Round.」
I learned how to hit the back of the head of the innocent Yoo Joonghyuk.
<&>「I maintained the Constellation modifier, but I couldn't pay for the Demon King modifier.」
I learned the tenacity to boldly sell off even his own modifier when necessary.
Is that all?
He even stole the share of his incarnation just because he didn't have any coins...
"It was fun. Wasn't it?"
He smiled brightly, knowing what I was thinking and what story I was thinking about.
"Yes, it was fun."
I really wanted to ask him so many things. As time passed, some questions lost their meaning, and some were naturally resolved.
And some questions remained between the lines. We each pulled out our weapons as if to bring out the questions that remained between the lines.
"That sword."
I said while looking at the sword held by the Demon King of Salvation.
A sword that looked like 'Unbreakable Faith' to anyone.
"It's mine."
However, I knew that the sword was not 'Unbreakable Faith'.
"It's mine now."
The Demon King of Salvation waved his sword in the air.
<!>[The Holy Relic 'Thoughts About Almost Everything' hums. ]
The Holy Relic I had lost as I entered the Recycling Center.
The 'thoughts' that could change into anything as long as the conditions were met burst into tears in the Demon King of Salvation's hand.
"You should have guarded it well."
"If you find a lost item, please return it to its owner."
"Owner?"
The sword in my hand was the real 'Unbreakable Faith'.
The sword used by Han Sooyoung when she visited this world line.
I felt strange. This sword was the weapon of the 'real Kim Dokja'. But now, the one holding 'Unbreakable Faith' is me.
<!>[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' smiles.]
My stomach kept churning.
It wasn't easy to face him smiling. For the first time, I felt like I didn't want to see the next page.
"You caused a great accident."
"I learned it from my sponsor."
We looked up at the sky at the same time. The only scenery we could share, as we had to aim our swords at each other.
"There are many Constellations today, too."
"It's always been like that."
The galaxy of the dazzling <Star Stream>.
The falling stars and the unfalling stars were looking at us.
"That's why we have to fight."
Was I the first to activate [Way of the Wind]? Or was it him? I don't know.
But when I came to my senses, we were standing on [Way of the Wind].
"It was good that we put Gilyoung to sleep."
"That's basic. I don't want him to fight you who has become a Mythical Constellation."
Standing in the center of the swirling wind, he did not show overwhelming force unlike when he confronted Lee Gilyoung of <Kim Dokja Company>.
<!>[The Demon King 'Demon King of Salvation''s power decreases.]
The aftershocks have decreased compared to before.
It was natural. Now his opponent is not Lee Gilyoung, but me.
The scale of the <Star Stream>, which had tilted abnormally, returned to suit my ability.
"Hey, let's see how much the Youngest's skills have improved."
The power has dropped to a similar level to mine. Even so, he is still a Constellation protected by the scenario. He was a star more powerful than any Constellation I have ever fought.
Scream!
We stretched our swords toward each other. The blows that could kill each other crossed.
I know that neither of us wants to hurt the other. Nevertheless, this confrontation had to continue.
<!>[The Constellations of the Nebula <Olympus> watch your battle.]
<!>[The Constellations of the Nebula <Asgard> watch your battle.]
<!>[The Constellations of the Nebula <Vedas> watch your battle.]
The [White and Blue Sword] embedded in each other's swordsmanship tore through the air with a sharp sound, and nothing was cut.
<!>[The constellation 'The One Who Brought Ten Lambs' watches your battle.]
<!>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' watches your battle.]
<!>[The constellation 'Reclining Dragon' watches your battle.]
<!>[Many constellations watch your battle!]
However, my heart, which had not been cut, ached.
"If you do not control the stories, you will live as the stories wish. Have you forgotten?"
Then the Demon King of Salvation laughed.
"Sometimes, it is not bad to live being pushed by the stories."
I looked down at Gilyoung, who was lying on the floor.
"You speak like a Constellation."
"Because I'm a Constellation."
<!>[The Constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' makes a displeased expression.]
<!>[The Constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' closes her sad eyes.]
<!>[Some Constellations show hostility toward the Demon King 'Demon King of Salvation.']
I bit my lips as I heard the voices resenting him.
He was the final boss of this scenario. He was a disaster designed to protect this forest and kill the students of the academy.
The stitching marks that remained on his body were proof of that.
"You used the body of the demon that was in Washington East."
The body of a Marquis-level Demon.
It was the very Demon that once impersonated the 'Demon King of Salvation.'
"This guy was also the 'Demon King of Salvation'."
That damn Demon King of Salvation.
I asked with a bitter smile.
"Isn't it time for that 'Demon King of Salvation' to stop?"
"That can't be. Without that name, I'm nothing."
"How long will you be the 'Demon King of Salvation'?"
"Until there's only one person left."
The Demon King of Salvation knows how this story will end.
And so do I.
"I don't want to write that kind of story."
"From now on, what you have to write is an 'impossible story'."
"The story you like, hyung?"
My sponsor smiled as if satisfied with my answer. When I couldn't meet his gaze, I lowered my head, and the Heavenly Sword that had fallen to the ground was emitting a white light.
"Yes."
There is only one way to solve this scenario.
<&>「From now on, I have to kill my sponsor.」
