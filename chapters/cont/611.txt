<title>611 Episode 12 □□ (2)
I continued to speak to Han Sooyoung, who did not answer.
"Aren’t you going to tie Yoo Joonghyuk here and lock him in a movie that repeats forever?"
Then, only a small part of the tragedy that will happen in this world due to Yoo Joonghyuk will occur.
If it was Han Soo-young, she would have already sent her [Avatar] outside.
Under her plan, the world will quietly perish, and Shin Yoosung will become a lost child of the worldline and embark on a journey to become a 'disaster'.
That is the complete ending of this 41st turn designed by Han Sooyoung.
After thinking for a moment, Han Sooyoung opened her mouth.
"Yeah, right."
"Why do you have to go this far?"
"If it's a world that's going to perish anyway, why don't we reduce the pain of destruction?"
As if deciding the end of a world, Han Sooyoung continued her words.
"You know what kind of guy Yoo Joonghyuk is in this world."
Han Sooyoung was looking at Yoo Joonghyuk.
"Not all Yoo Joonghyuk are good guys. Yoo Joonghyuk is also human, and he makes mistakes. Yoo Joonghyuk in the 41st turn is a guy who will make a lot of mistakes."
But what she was seeing was probably not the bequest power of this world.
A distant shadow of a tale passed over her eyes.
From the 0th turn to the 1865th turn.
To Han Sooyoung, who described Omniscient Reader Viewpoint, 'Yoo Joonghyuk' may not be a character, but a phenomenon and concept.
"It's a mistake that hasn't happened yet."
I thought of Yoo Joonghyuk who had talked to me and Yoo Joonghyuk who had confided in Cheon Inho of the 40th turn.
Yoo Joonghyuk wanted to see the end of this world, even by borrowing the hands of the wicked.
Yoo Joonghyuk tried to teach the people of Geumho Station how to hunt.
Yoo Joonghyuk, who left 'The Spirit of Elaine Forest' for me.
Is Yoo Joonghyuk really a bad guy?
"We may change it."
"If you do that, something worse will happen."
Something worse.
"If you change the story, another worldline will be born starting from this turn. Also, a universe of countless scenarios will be born."
I felt like my heart was tightening.
"You asked why I came here?"
There was quiet anger in Han Sooyoung's voice.
"I have come down to the conclusion of this whole story. To stop this damn tragedy that never ends no matter how much I close it."
When I heard that story, I felt sad for some reason. Maybe it's because I remembered Han Sooyoung's sentence.
<&>「Forever and ever, I will write a final chapter for you.」
Han Sooyoung, who had written that sentence for Kim Dokja when he was young, was now trying to write the last sentence that would end all this world.
It could be.
I benefit from her like that.
But I'm curious about one thing.
"I."
Why does her face as she tries to write the last sentence look so sad?
"This kind of ending is unacceptable."
"Who are you?"
"I am."
Who am I?
"I am someone who is still using the Omniscient Reader's Point of view that you started."
Han Sooyoung was silent for a moment, as if she could understand what those words meant.
And she asked.
"Are you sure?"
"I am not confident."
I had never written a story because I was confident.
"There is still a story to be told."
The moment her Han Sooyoung was about to open her mouth, I kicked off the floor and ran toward her.
Whatever her Han Sooyoung's purpose was, I couldn't just sit by and watch the situation.
<&>「I must clear ‘Theatre Dungeon’.」
Only then can I save Killer King.」
It can liberate other readers who may have been at risk of being overworked.
I can save Yoo Joonghyuk.
Han Sooyoung's left hand moved with a sound like chi-chi-tsu. The flame of [Black Flame] in her hand flew towards me, burning the roof floor.
I breathed in as hard as I could and cried out.
"Turn into the shield of Hercules."
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.6' is activated!]
'Thoughts of almost everything' turned into a replica version of 'Hercules' Shield obtained' from the room of rewards.
<!>[You’ve activate the special skill 'wide area defense'!]
A translucent barrier spread around the shield.
Han Sooyoung's [Black Flame] melted more than half of the shield and then scattered.
Her hands and feet were searing hot, and her breathing was labored by the heat that burned all around her.
I endured the frenzy and opened my mouth.
"Heewon-ssi. Are you there?"
Then a voice came from behind.
"How did you know?"
Holding 'Mikazuki Munechika' in her left hand and wearing 'impossible mission' on her body, Jung Heewon was standing behind me.
I said without looking back.
"I thought it was time for you to wake up. When did you wake up?"
"From the white room earlier."
Jung Heewon laughed for a while. She added, standing beside me.
"You said something important, so I thought I shouldn’t interrupt you."
"What about now?"
"I thought you would die if I didn’t interfere."
We smiled at each other for a while. As if her physical condition has recovered properly, Jung Heewon's whole body wriggled with a deep magical blue.
"That person is very strong."
Jeong Heewon, who took a glance at Han Sooyoung, nodded her head.
"I see."
I pointed to the Theater Owner in front of Han Sooyoung and said.
"The target is not her. It is the old man in front of him."
"If you get rid of that, this dungeon will end too, right?"
I nodded.
Han Sooyoung listened to our conversation in silence from a distance.
A look that assures us that things won't change no matter what we do.
As if she didn't like her attitude, Jung Heewon stepped in front of me.
"Do you know what you said to me before passing out? Please do it one more time."
I thought about what that meant and said.
"You may pass out again."
"It’s frustrating, but now I feel like I won’t be able to win if I don’t listen to it."
Sparks flashed in Jung Heewon's eyes.
A voice that has already made up its mind.
If the painting fell, the tie was only now.
When Han Sooyoung is even a little bit off guard. I opened my mouth to bring out the strongest card we can use.
"Every enemy in front of you from now on."
Now, it was our turn to tell our story.
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Incitement Lv.6' is activated!]
"They are monsters."
With those words as a signal, the wave of her magic power exploded from Jung Heewon's body.
<!>[Character Jung Heewon requests the activation of 'Time of Judgment'.]
Then, the indirect message from the constellations echoed in my head.
<!>[Constellation 'Tiger eating rice cake' agrees with Incarnation 'Jung Heewon'.]
<!>[Constellation 'Lord of mischief' agrees with Incarnation 'Jung Heewon'’s will.]
<!>[The constellation 'Pig living in a brick house' agrees with Incarnation ‘Jung Heewon'.]
<!>[Constellation 'Taejo's cow’' agrees with Incarnation 'Jung Heewon''s will.]
And.
<!>[Time of Judgment has been activated.]
Jung Heewon ran up the roof with a roar. The acceleration was enough to open the eyes of Han Sooyoung.
Han Sooyoung's left hand moved hurriedly and emitted [Black Flame].
<!>['Mikazuki Munechika''s special option 'Traces of the Four Gods' is activated!]
Jung Heewon's new weapon, which is as dark as a shadow, reached right in front of Han Sooyoung, avoiding the flames of [Black Flame].
Movements that show no hesitation.
The magical power in her right hand dyed Mikazuki Munechika's blade.
It was a perfect sword.
Jung Heewon's [sword] with a blue strong spirit aimed exactly at the neck of the Theater Owner.
"It’s rare. This isn't the [Judgment Hour] I know."
With the voice, Jung Heewon's sword stopped.
As if there was an invisible force of repulsion between Han Sooyoung and Jung Heewon, Jung Heewon's sword trembled in the air and was pushed away.
I belatedly realized what had happened.
<!>[The Theatre Owner attempts 'mental erosion'!]
During that short interval, Han Sooyoung borrowed the skill of the Theater Owner and attacked Jung Heewon.
Damnit.
"Heewon-ssi! Step back!"
Jung Heewon's eyes slowly grew cloudy.
Jung Heewon said that among the members of <Kim Dokja’s Company>, she is especially vulnerable to mental attacks.
From the beginning, there was no way she could withstand the attack of the Theater Owner.
The moment I hurriedly ran and reached out my hand toward Jung Heewon.
"I've been stuck there for years."
With Han Sooyoung's words, her vision flipped.
Han Sooyoung, who grabbed my wrist, turned me over and pinned me to the floor. An excruciating pain ran down my back, and I was choking on my breath. I could feel the narration flowing through her fingertips and overturning my energy and blood.
A level of power difference that is not even a fight.
Blood gushed from my mouth, and my consciousness went out for a moment and then came back.
"This, that thing."
I heard Jung Heewon's voice.
When I slowly opened my eyes, I saw Jung Heewon staggering forward.
"This is-"
Blood vessels burst from her eyes, and Jung Heewon took a step forward, bleeding from her bitten lips.
Han Soo-young made an admiring face.
"You. You’re a bit different from the Jung Heewon I know."
Something immediately came to mind.
Come to think of it, something similar happened in [Illusion Prison].
Even though she received the item's equipping effect, Jung Heewon defeated the specters without suffering any trauma.
<&>「The Jung Heewon of this world has no trauma associated with the villains of Geumho Station.」
It wasn't her hatred of the bad guys that awakened her.
The regular member of the 41st turn is a person who became a 'judge' only to save me.
Han Sooyoung muttered in a low voice.
"It’s surprising that the regular member is still alive…. Why is the 41st turn so interesting?"
With just a moment of encounter, Han Sooyoung seemed to be blinded by the new history of Jung Heewon.
"But to say that Inho is on your side, the Jung Heewon, whom I know, would be sad to see it?"
"What?"
"Jung Heewon. Aren't you curious what the original story was like?"
The tip of her white finger touched Jung Heewon's forehead in a magical trajectory.
<!>[A grand narrative 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' begins its storytelling.]
I could see Jung Heewon's pupils widening. I also got goosebumps on my forearms.
It wasn't clear what exactly Jung Heewon was looking at, but it wasn't hard to imagine that it was.
"See? That's the true identity of that person you believe in."
Jung Heewon was watching the story of the 3rd turn.
<&>「"My name is Cheon Inho."」
To be precise, she was looking at the Cheon Inho of that world.
<&>「"You're right. Scouts receive more rations. So, if you want to get food, please join the scouting party."」
The villain of Geumho Station. The one who bullied people and put Jung Heewon in danger of dying.
Cheon Inho, the leader of the Deolsoo group.
<&>「The guy's words did not continue. It's because Jung Heewon, who appeared from behind, pierced Cheon Inho's face from the top of his head.」
In that world, Jung Heewon killed Cheon Inho and regained her life.
The story did not end there.
Blood flowed from Jung Heewon's nose and mouth as she watched the stories of the third turn flowing like a panorama.
"This."
Looking at Jeong Hee-won, Han Soo-young was making an unknown expression.
At that moment, Han Sooyoung was like a demon king, a dokkaebi, and a constellation. Han Sooyoung looked like a god.
The story of her life explained her.
The stories gathered one by one while overcoming the risk of dying countless times.
She was standing on the far-flung text where <Kim Dokja’s Company> and Han Sooyoung’s day-to-day gatherings were gathered.
She is unreachable.
A story that leaves you in awe just by looking at it. At the top of the story, Han Soo-young was omnipotent.
Like a child who effortlessly knocks down a poorly built Jenga. She was destroying Jung Heewon with her nonchalant fingers.
It felt like all the strength was draining from her body.
She said, "Look carefully at who you are trying to be loyal to. See what life you should have had."
The history of this world, our lives, built up with my crude sentences, were collapsing.
"Hallucination…"
"It's not a hallucination."
"Even if this is true."
Jung Heewon stuttered and said.
Her eyes were glistening with a terrible light.
"This world is… not that… world."
The moment she heard those words, her eyes flashed as if she had been bathed in cold water.
Power returned to her fingertips. My dizzy vision returned to its place. I fumbled on the floor and stood up.
<&>「This world is not 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』.」
Jung Heewon was right.
<&>「Because this world has never been properly described.」
I stumbled and took one step, then two again.
Han Sooyoung turned to me as if warning me.
"If you come any closer, you will die."
I asked Han Sooyoung.
"Were you originally going to save me?"
Han Sooyoung's hand, enveloped in [Black Flame], slowly aimed at me.
Looking at her like that, I thought.
<&>「Really, this world is not the 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』 that I know.」
What I can and cannot do now. Sentences I can write and sentences I cannot write.
<&>「A new sentence is needed in this world now.」
And a piece of blank paper, needed to write a 'sentence'.
The moment Han Soo-young's [Black Flame] shot at me.
<!>[You want to do something unexpected.]
I decided to write her 'sentence' against her.
<!>[Describe your actions.]
<!>[Consumes 5 points of probability.]
<!>[The activation conditions for the exclusive skill '□□' have been met.]
The color of the world changed to achromatic and time stopped.
<!>[Entering the ‘Snowfield’.]
And in the next moment, something that had never happened before happened.
<!>[An error has occurred in 'Snowfield'!]
+
#□□
<&>「□□?□□?□?□□?□□□?□□□□□□□?□□□?□□□?□□?□□□□□?□□□?□□□?□□…」
*Based on the current proficiency, a total of ? additional characters are possible.
+
<!>[The total amount of time you can stay in 'Snowfield' is ? minutes.]
The manuscript paper in front of my eyes was all broken. Neither the remaining time nor the limited number of characters were indicated.
I blankly stared at the blank space, then suddenly smiled.
<&>「Suddenly, Lee Hak-hyun felt everything that was free.」
As if rejecting the rule of time, only I was awake in a world where everyone stopped.
A feeling that whatever sentence I write will come true. A feeling that I can write whatever sentence I want to my heart's content.
I remembered the first sentence.
<&>「Lee Hak-hyun moved his hand.」
This snowy field is a world between the lines where all time and space are frozen. So I couldn't be physically free either.
<&>「Then his hand moved.」
But strangely, my hand moved.
<&>「When I moved, my step falls, and when I clench my fist, my fist clenches.」
I don't know why this happened, but maybe this was an opportunity.
If only I could use this situation to kill the Theater Owner.
This world is between the lines where only I can stay. If this is possible, I would do it without anyone interfering-
Tsutsutsutsutsutsu!
It was then that intense sparks flew in the air.
Through the sparks’ bright light, someone was looking this way.
"It’s fun. Does this happen?"
The moment I heard her voice, I felt my heart sink.
Han Sooyoung was there.
"This is your ability."
As if protecting her, I could see the flow of letters coiling around her. She, like me, defied the restraints of time. Standing freely in the center of the snowfield.
<&>「Above the lines and sentences, only two writers have escaped the rule of time.」
At that moment, I felt the gaze of a very faintly shining star on the far side of the snowfield.
<&>「And one reader watched it.」
I blankly looked up at the sky, then lowered my head to look at Han Sooyoung.
The stage was set, and what I had to do was clear.
There are two writers here now.
But in the end, what is recorded here.
"There is only one story."
