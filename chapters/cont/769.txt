<title>769 Episode 33 Ball (8)
In 'Ways of Survival', the 'Recycling Center Director' changes depending on the round.
The head of a small and medium-sized nebula like <Tamra> was in charge of the Recycling Center, and the renegade Abyssal Black Flame Dragon once turned the Recycling Center into his playground, and Reinheit, the owner of the Ten Evils-Paradise, who awakened as the 'Demon King', opened the Recycling Center as 'double'. There was also a time when it was used as a 'first paradise'.
However, the 'Recycling Center Director' of this 41st Round was none of them.
I did not feel the spirit of a small or medium nebula leader, the playfulness of a black flame dragon, or the madness of Reinheit.
All I can feel is a neat and calm atmosphere. It felt exactly like the principal of 'Philia Hunter Academy' I had imagined.
"You are the head of the Recycling Center—"
A spark of probability pressed through my whole body along with the sound of "tsutsutsu". It was my last act of dignity not to scream.
<@>[Uh huh, such remarks are prohibited here.]
"Wasn’t it okay in the principal’s office?"
<@>[I’m the only one who’s okay with that.]
It certainly seems like that. Because there was no sense of 'world view' around the principal.
"With your authority, principal, please make it okay for me for a moment."
<@>[That's difficult, because you speak too well. For now, just stick to your role.]
"I’m good at speaking?"
<@>[I only hear what I want to hear. Is there anyone who doesn't know about your cunning tongue?]
I thought for a moment whether the joke was about 'me' in this worldview, or about Kim Dokja from the <Star Stream>.
<@>[What brought you here today?]
"Well, that’s it."
<@>[The graduation exam date is slowly approaching. Is that perhaps why you came?]
You are kind enough to take care of my business first. However, I had no intention of performing my 'role' so obediently.
"I just came here to discuss my concerns."
<@>[Consultation for concerns?]
"If you were a benevolent principal, you would listen to your students’ concerns, right?"
The principal looked at me with narrowed eyes. It seemed like he was watching my plans.
<@>[Good. Try it.]
"I’ve been worried about my career path lately."
<@>[Weren’t you an aspiring member of the 'swordsman club'?]
I guess that was the original setting.
But I have no intention of going as planned.
"Recently, I’m more interested in 'records' than knives."
<@>[Records?]
"Yes. Actually, I—"
As I said those words, I looked up somewhere in the sky. I was curious as to whether this statement would offend the world view or not.
"I’ve been writing some novels lately."
<!>[The world view-only attribute 'Reader (S)' is activated.]
<!>[Your actions gain probability through the effect of 'Reader (S)'.]
I knew it.
Since my name is Kim Dokja, how can I not have this characteristic?
<!>[My world view is confused by your speech.]
The principal seemed somewhat surprised, as if he had never thought I would use the world view in this way.
<@>[It’s a novel. Hmm, I guess I'll have to make some changes to your life record first.]
"Yeah, well. You can talk about that later, but let’s talk about the novel I’m writing. It’s quite interesting."
<@>[Do you really have to tell me that? I'm the principal?]
"Is there a law against talking about novels to the principal?"
<@>[I think it would be better to consult with a teacher who majors in the subject.]
"It looks like you forgot the settings. There is no Korean language teacher at our school."
<@>[There are no Korean teachers, but there are teachers who like novels. For example, Teacher Yang—]
"Teacher Yang said that there is no one who has read as many 'novels' as the principal. From old stories to recently popular stories. They say you are an expert in all genres."
<!>[The worldview feels strongly disturbed by your utterance.]
<!>[The world view cannot interpret your utterance.]
Light sparks began to fly in the air.
The principal stared at me for a moment, hesitated, and then answered.
<@>[I do like reading. So?]
"I’m stuck in the development of the novel I was writing, so I’d like to ask for some advice."
<@>[Didn't you say it was a career issue earlier...]
"It’s a novel career issue."
<@>[…What is the novel about?]
"It’s a novel called 'Infinite Prison Guard'."
<@>[It’s a title that has a high probability of being uninteresting.]
"To put it briefly, it is a story about the main character attending 'Philia Hunter Academy' and fighting against demons."
<@>[Oh, that’s a familiar school name.]
"Anyway, the main character of the novel is Kim Dokja."
<@>[Isn’t that your name?]
"It’s just the main character’s name and it has nothing to do with me. What kind of crazy writer would write a main character under his own name?"
<@>[So what does it mean that the development has been blocked?]
"Suddenly the characters started moving without my intention."
<@>[Ho, that’s a writer’s concern.]
"It’s not a metaphor, it’s real. In particular, 'Teacher Yang' is very different from the 'Teacher Yang' I set."
<!>[The worldview feels strongly disturbed by your speech!]
The probability aftereffects have become more serious than before. The principal's expression hardened as the aftermath seemed to pressurize the entire principal's office.
"Do I really have to say that it looks like someone else has possessed her…?"
<!>[The worldview cannot interpret your utterance!]
<!>[The probability of this worldview are starting to explode!]
"The principal even brought up a possibility that didn’t exist in the story—"
Just as the storm that rose up in an instant was about to cover the entire principal's office, a powerful explosion exploded from the principal's entire body.
For a moment, the surrounding probability faded away with a dull sound. The worldview that was watching me was moving away.
The 'principal’s office' he built withstood the probability of the 'worldview'.
<!>[The 'Principal's Office' area is temporarily outside the control of the universe.]
The principal, whose complexion was somewhat paler than before, sighed.
<@>[I really can't beat you.]
"Can I tell you my real concern now?"
<@>[Do whatever you want. Isn’t that why you did this?]
As I looked at the principal shaking his head, I remembered the description I wrote a long time ago.
<&>「A middle-aged man with gray hair waved his hand. A pink Hawaiian shirt with a pineapple on it and ripped jeans.」
Although I only remembered his appearance through description, I was convinced the moment I saw him.
"Are you the 'Mass Production Manufacturer'?"
Then the Mass Production Manufacturer smiled brightly. With the exact expression that only existed in my head.
<@>[Maybe so, maybe not.]
"Yes and no."
I nodded and continued speaking.
"You are the 'Mass Production Manufacturer' from the 1,864th world line and the 'Recycling Center Director' from the 41st world line."
The Mass Production Manufacturer seemed a little surprised and did not respond.
"Have other Constellations been possessed into this world like you? How many people have crossed over?"
<!>[…]
"What is your purpose? Why are you suddenly intervening in this world line?"
Along with the question, I thought of the 'existences from other world lines' I had encountered so far.
Asmodeus owns the 'theater' where the little Kim Dokjas reside.
Shin Yoosoung from <Kim Dokja Company>, who possessed Shin Yoosoung.
Cheon Inho in the 40th Round was strangely strong.
Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung appeared as Constellations.
Even Uriel became 'Teacher Yang'.
"What are you planning in this 41st Round? If this continues and the probability of the world line becomes distorted—"
<@>[The probability has already been distorted. Not only this world line, but the probability of the entire universe.]
As he slowly pulled back the curtains by the window, the scenery of the 'Forest of Demons' came into view.
<@>[At the very moment you were born.]
A tone of voice that stimulates all kinds of sinister imagination.
I asked back reflexively.
"What does that mean?"
Just by exchanging a few words, the spark area was growing again.
The Mass Produced Manufacturer said, blinking lazily.
<@>[You probably have a lot of questions. But I only intend to answer three questions.]
As I watched the sparks encroaching on the bottom of the room once again, I chose questions over and over again in my mind.
And then I opened my mouth.
"Why did you become the 'Recycling Center Director'?"
<@>[You can only ask three questions. Do you really want to ask that?]
Of course, there were many other things I wanted to ask:
Why did the Constellations gather for this 41st Round?
Are you aware of the existence of 'Representative Kim Dokja'?
What is Asmodeus' purpose?
How can I see the end of this world?
Where is the 'Demon King of Salvation'?
But some questions would be resolved in time, some I would have to figure it out on my own, and some I wasn't sure I would ever get an answer to.
"If I choose an answer that is easy for you, shouldn’t you spend less on probability? Please answer. Why did you become 'Director of the Recycling Center'?"
So the first question I chose was this.
<@>[You really haven’t changed.]
The mass-produced manufacturer laughed slightly.
As if I was right, the progress of the Probability Sparks encroaching on the room slowed slightly.
<@>[You probably know that I like old tales.]
I nodded.
<@>[Among them, there is one tale I particularly like. A story about a man.]
It was a story I also knew well.
A story that started in the subway and ended in the subway. The story of a star who sacrifices himself to protect the world of his loved ones.
It was the story of a man who loved stories so much that he became eternity within them.
<!>[It is a story called 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint'.]
I took a silent breath. I had no idea that that title would come out of the mouth of the mass-produced manufacturer.
I bit my lip and asked again.
"Is bringing Uriel related to that story?"
Now that I think about it, that was the second question.
The Mass Produced Manufacturer shrugged his shoulders and answered.
<@>[I just suggested it. It is by her will that she came.]
"Uriel is not a tool in the scenario."
<@>[No one should be a tool for the scenario. These are truly pretty and fleeting words.]
"…"
<@>[As you probably already know, we are merely actors playing our respective roles in the vast Star Stream. The only thing that flows is the story. The Scribe  of Eden understood his role better than anyone else. That's why I came here to protect you.]
I couldn't say anything.
<@>[You too can choose like her. The first option is to do nothing.]
You don't have to do anything.
This is what Uriel also said.
<@>[You can stay at this school and delay graduation. You will have a wonderful time as a student with your peers. Participating in club activities, joining the student council, studying for exams, and eating lunch.]
"That can’t be the ending."
<@>[Can you really say that’s the case?]
"Not everything that looks like a road can be a road."
A road that is not a road.
That was advice that the Mass Production Manufacturer once left to Kim Dokja.
<&>「Please choose your path carefully. Sometimes what seems like a road may not be a road.」
The mass-produced manufacturer smiled brightly, as if recalling memories of that time.
<@>[Is that so? In the past, I used to say things like that.]
As before, he took out a cigarette from his chest and lit it. There was an unknown longing buried in the hazy smoke.
<@>[Now I think 'a road that is not a road' is also not a bad thing.]
Why did he change his mind?
I remembered the '◼️◼️' of the mass production type manufacturer. Clearly, he had reached his own conclusion then.
<@>[This is because I thought that not every story necessarily needs an ending.]
If for a moment I felt like his eyes were worried about me, was it my delusion?
<@>[At least you are safe if you stay at this school. The same goes for your colleagues. If only you could fool yourself.]
"…"
<@>[Did you forget? The protagonist of 『Infinite Prison Guard』 also made a similar choice.]
I thought of Ma Hyunsung, who repeated the world forever to protect a single save file.
<@>[Either clear this scenario, or stay in this scenario… In the end, destruction will come to you. The end of this world is certain. It's just a difference in speed. You can make this your home. As we face a leisurely and peaceful destruction.]
"Like Reinheit in Paradise?"
<@>[Yes, like Reinheit in Paradise.]
"You just said that was your first option."
<@>[That's right.]
"From now on, please tell me about the third option first. I will definitely choose that option."
The Mass Produced Manufacturer laughed silently and looked out the window. The setting sun beyond the forest was reflected in his eyes, which were as distant as the night sky.
His voice, tinged with sunset, was strangely lonely.
<@>[Do you know why the stars liked Kim Dokja’s story?]
"I do not know."
<@>[It's because the choices Kim Dokja makes give us expectations.]
My face and Kim Dokja’s face were shining through the window covered in sunset. We have always chosen something with this face.
"It wasn’t a choice made to get attention from the stars."
<@>[Maybe so. Anyway, Kim Dokja showed the outcome he sought with his shameless attitude.]
"..."
<@>[At that moment, even though all the stars were looking at different scenery, they belonged to a single story. That was a really great thing.]
I thought of Kim Dokja's soul, which was split into tens or hundreds of thousands of pieces and scattered.
I too was one of them.
<@>[But then Kim Dokja disappeared and something went awry. Now, 'one dream' no longer exists in this universe.]
The Mass Produced Manufacturer slowly turned his head and looked at me. An unknown longing flickered in his deeply sunken eyes.
For a moment, I felt like I knew why he was here. I felt like I knew why he brought Uriel and why he and all the readers took refuge here.
<@>[This time, please don’t end that dream arbitrarily.]
The mass production type manufacturer.
He is a star who loves the oldest tale in this world.
Using all his coins, the Constellation recreated the ◼️◼️ he dreamed of in the story of 'Kim Dokja'.
<@>[Just like your brother did.]
He wants the 'one and only Kim Dokja' to be revived once again.
Tsutsutsutsu.
The pressure on the principal's office was slowly growing stronger. There was no time anymore.
It was time to ask the last question.
"Where is the Demon King of Salvation?"
He glanced out the window once again.
<@>[He is a body consecrated to the scenario. You can never meet the way you want.]
"Then—"
Tsutsutsu, a sound followed by a storm enveloped the entire principal's office.
<@>[The world view is staring at the 'principal’s office'.]
As the world's rules fell into place, I once again became a part of 'Philia Hunter Academy'.
The being who had previously been the 'mass production type producer' was looking at me.
<@>[You have earned all the points.]
He is the principal of this school.
And I was his student.
<@>[Are you going to take the graduation exam?]
Beyond the window, in the forest of demons, a probability afterstorm was rumbling. Students who realized that the forest's behavior was strange were seen leaving the dormitory one by one.
Among them were my colleagues.
Someone had a solemn look in their eyes, and someone was holding a weapon with a nervous look.
Looking down from up high, they all really looked like actors in a play.
"You already know my answer, don’t you?"
The principal nodded.
<@>[Your brother is waiting for you.]
Along with the principal's words, an explosion was heard from afar.
<!>[You have earned all the points required for the graduation exam.]
<!>[The principal has approved your graduation exam.]
<!>['Graduation exam' begins.]
The forest was crying. The ground trembled and a huge number of demons were seen running across the border of the forest.
<!>[The energy of great demons stirs in the 'Forest of Demons'.]
Moans and screams heard from everywhere. A message was heard in the air along with the sound of weapons exploding.
<!>[The Great Demon, the '73rd Demon King' has descended!]
My brother was calling me.
