<title>865 Episode 47 King of Fear (9)
There were three 'Kim Dokjas' that I've met so far.
First, the Demon King of Salvation.
The sponsor I made a contract with, and now my 'first brother' who helps me inside the [Fourth Wall].
Second, the King of Fear.
The master of the Fear Realm, and the being who created the Time Fault. My 'second brother' who tries to turn the entire <Star Stream> into a 'Fear Realm'.
Three, Kim Dokja of the snowfield.
The Kim Dokja that I first met.
The Kim Dokja that spoke to me in the snowfield and gave me tea.
The only one who wasn't called by a 'modifier', he wasn't the first, the second, or the third Kim Dokja that hadn't yet appeared.
I knew who he was.
'49% Kim Dokja'.
A Kim Dokja who was torn apart in the process of the 'Oldest Dream' being shattered into fragments, just like me. The difference was that he fell into the snowfield, not on Earth, and was raised by Cheon Inho there.
He probably increased the total amount of 'Kim Dokja fragments' through Cheon Inho. And eventually, he must have gained enough strength to threaten the status of the main body.
That's right. This 'Kim Dokja' in front of me right now is—
<&>「It's been a long time.」
The one who tore Kim Dokja's main body apart and created the current 'Kim Dokja brothers'.
"You—"
I opened my mouth with a trembling voice.
Is it because of my mood? It felt different from when I met him before. His smile, which had felt strangely sad and hazy, had darkened a little.
<&>「You've finally come this far, ■■.」
Pitch-black stories fell from the 'Unbreakable Faith' he held. It was the story of the 'King of Fear'.
Ignoring the screams of the stories, he spoke with his lips pursed.
<&>「You lost your name, you.」
Snowfield Kim Dokja smiled bitterly as if he knew what had happened.
<&>「I told you. Tell me the story you want to tell.」
"…"
<&>「If you had done as I said, you wouldn’t have lost your name.」
The story I wanted.
I couldn’t help but feel repulsed by those words.
What on earth was the story I wanted to tell? What story should I have told so that I wouldn’t lose my name?
<&>「Well, it doesn’t matter. You wanted to become 'Kim Dokja' too.」
Snowfield Kim Dokja turned his back on me as he said that. The King of Fear was looking at me from afar. Before I knew it, his severed arm was regenerating.
I staggered and stood up.
I don’t know why 'Snowfield Kim Dokja' had appeared here. However, I instinctively felt a sense of rejection. I felt that I couldn’t just leave him alone.
"Why did you come here?"
A different fighting spirit began to flow from the King of Fear’s body. It was a huge aura that seemed to cover the entire snowfield with 'fear'.
Snowfield Kim Dokja also began to manifest his power. It was a magnificent story that I had never witnessed before.
<&>「■■-ah.」
My name was filtered and inaudible. Even so, I could clearly feel that he was calling me.
<&>「I came to save you.」
Considering the situation, his words were right. However, the moment I saw the smile on his face, I had an ominous feeling.
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall', shakes.]
The [Fourth Wall] twitched as if in agreement with that feeling. The fierce anger of the 'First Kim Dokja' could be felt from beyond the wall.
Snowfield Kim Dokja continued to ask, whether he knew my condition or not.
<&>「If we don't stop that guy, this world line will be destroyed. Do you want that?」
I shook my head. Of course I wouldn't want that. I also want to protect this world line.
<&>「Then back off. I’ll take care of this.」
I didn’t back down. I felt like I shouldn’t do that. I knew why I was thinking that way.
"You’re thinking of absorbing the 'King of Fear', right?"
Snowfield Kim Dokja looked at me blankly, then asked back without changing his expression at all.
<&>「Is there a reason why I can’t?」
The moment I saw that expression that resembled me more than any other Kim Dokja, my heart skipped a beat.
<&>「You absorbed the 'Demon King of Salvation' too, right?」
"I didn’t absorb him."
<&>「Aha. So he’s inside the [Fourth Wall] of his own free will?」
Snowfield Kim Dokja smiled brightly and reached out to me. The moment his long fingers touched my cheek, sparks flew out with a tsutsutsu sound.
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated!]
Snowfield Kim Dokja looked at me with his characteristically hazy smile and asked.
<&>「How long will that trick work?」
"..."
<&>「Eventually, 'Kim Dokja' will gather again. Because the <Star Stream> wants it.」
His voice sounded unfamiliar.
Was Snowfield Kim Dokja originally like this? Who on earth changed him into this? Or was he originally like this, and I was seeing things wrong?
"If it was going to be like this anyway, why did you tell me to tell 'my story'?"
At one time, I trusted him. I thought he would be on my side, that he would support me no matter what. No matter what anyone said, he was the first person who told me to tell 'my story'.
<&>「You couldn't do it in the end.」
The moment I heard that, I thought I knew what had changed him.
<&>「You couldn't make your story right. You couldn't do this or that right, and you became 'an ordinary Kim Dokja'.」
An ordinary Kim Dokja.
<&>「That's why I'm going to do it.」
Maybe it was me who changed him.
It was the story I made.
<&>「I am you.」
For the first time, his smile didn't feel beautiful.
<&>「You're just standing there watching like you always have. Until this 'round' ends.」
I turned around without saying anything and looked at his back. A gorgeous white coat fluttering in the wind. A back that looked better in a coat than any other Kim Dokja I'd ever seen.
In the end, the story is about the main character.
And in this war of Kim Dokjas, maybe I am not the main character.
Snowfield Kim Dokja opened his mouth to the King of Fear.
<&>「We don't need to talk long.」
<!>[The story, 'Wanderer of the Snowfield', begins its storytelling.]
Wanderer of the Snowfield.
It was a story that had never appeared in the main story.
<!>[The story, 'Master of Fear', howls!]
In response, the 'King of Fear' also brought out his story. The two tales howled at each other for a long time, and in the next moment, 'Snowfield Kim Dokja's' footsteps disappeared.
Then, a loud noise shook the entire snowfield.
Snowfield Kim Dokja, wrapped in Baekcheong's strong energy, was pushing the King of Fear. A quick and clear swordsmanship reminiscent of Lee Jihye's [Sunsal]. [Full Electrification] that can be freely activated even without [Miniaturization]. The splendid strong energy that extended from the swordsmanship exploded like firecrackers, destroying the King of Fear's entire body.
But the King of Fear didn't just take it easy. The King of Fear, who had been crouching, spread his wings wide. The dust that fell from his wings seemed to cover the entire snowfield, and then a huge vortex formed around several dust particles.
The vortex soon turned into a pitch-black portal.
<#>【Ooooooooooo!】
A pitch-black tentacle appeared beyond the portal.
I immediately realized what kind of deity it was.
<&>「This is interesting.」
The 'Outer Gods of natural disasters' including the 'Dream Eater' crossed the portal to save the 'King of Fear'.
<&>「This is really an ability that is not like 'Kim Dokja'.」
Snowfield Kim Dokja activated [Baekcheongganggi] again. It was a skill on a different level than the [Baekcheongganggi] I had used.
The 'Blade of Faith' that was dozens of times longer cut off the 'Dream Eater's' leg.
<#>【Ooooooooooo!】
As the 'Dream Eater' roared, other Outer  Gods began to surge in through the portal. Outer Gods ranging from disaster-level to catastrophe-level fear. They were gods of the other world who lived in fear under the 'King of Fear'.
Snowfield Kim Dokja cut down the Outer Gods rushing in without hesitation. The corpses of the Outer Gods who were cut down in an instant were piling up on the snowfield’s floor.
They were talking.
<&>「I don’t like it.」
Death was rising.
<&>「I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it.」
I approached the two of them through the corpses of Outer Deities. However, due to the stories of Outer Gods pouring out of the air, the two of them were no longer visible.
The sense of distance seemed to prove the gap between them and me.
As if there was no room for me to interrupt, the two stood in their respective positions. One was to destroy the world line, and the other side was to prevent the destruction of the world line.
Then where is my position?
Am I on the side that wants to destroy the world line, or the side that wants to protect the world line?
<!>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', growls.]
If not both, then where is my position that does not choose both?
<&>「"Tell me your story."」
In return for choosing this position, what was the story I ultimately wanted to write?
Once again, I felt someone grab my hand tightly. It was Kiyeon hyung. Kiyeon hyung's body, holding me tightly with his small hands, was shining brightly.
Kiyeon hyung's memories flowed into me through the [Fourth Wall].
<&>「"Writing interesting stories is protecting world peace."」
That's right.
<&>「"If everyone is focused on my story, people won't fight with each other."」
I nodded without realizing it and took a step, I took another step.
My steps were not as flashy as those of other Dokjas. But I also walked diligently.
"If you have a mouth, you can talk, and if you have ears, you can listen."
There is an interesting story left in my head. That story is not over yet.
"So listen to me."
There is an ending that I absolutely must write. There is a debt that I must repay, and there are sentences that I must write.
And to fill in those sentences.
"Don't fight, you rascals!"
This 'space between the lines' must still be empty.
<!>[The story 'Way of the Wind' begins its storytelling!]
They are not the only ones who are not restricted by probability here.
I am the same.
I may not be as strong or have overwhelming skill as them, but I am also a Dokja. I can fight in my own way.
"I told you to stop!"
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.???', is activated!]
Even with [Incite] with a greatly increased proficiency, I couldn't stop them.
I thought. I needed a sentence that would stop them even for a moment. But what should I say now to stop them?
What would be the most effective way to provoke them right now?
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.???', is strongly activated!]
I jumped over the corpses of the Outer Gods and flew into the air, opening my mouth at them.
"You guys—"
Even if these words were not true, if I could just steal a moment from you.
"Aren’t Kim Dokja!"
With a 'tsutsutsu' sound, sparks flew out of the air.
The two Kim Dokjas, who had not responded at all until now, looked back at me at the same time. A deep silence fell over the battlefield for a moment. Neither of them opened their mouths, but both of them were asking me with their gazes.
<&>「What did you just say?」
I laughed, hiding the cold sweat running down my back.
"Aren't you curious?"
Seriously, you damn brothers.
"Why did my words, which weren't even true, stop you for a moment?"
Maybe I envy you.
I envy those of you who don’t doubt the fact that you are 'Kim Dokja'. I feel ashamed of myself for constantly running to become Kim Dokja and become even a little bit like him.
However, because I have been running like that, because I am Kim Dokja, who is weaker than anyone else, there are things I can do.
I stood between the two who were glaring at me and stretched out my hand and said.
"In fact, you know that too. If it were the real Kim Dokja, he wouldn’t act like that."
As soon as I finished saying that, a storm of stories swept through the two beings’ bodies. It seemed as if they didn’t care whether I was in the middle or not, whether my soul was torn apart or not.
"You will come out like that."
They knew that too. That my current power wouldn’t be enough to stop them anyway.
But there were also things that the two of them didn’t know. For example,
"You who seek old fears."
The fact that from now on, I am not the one who will stand between them.
"I will fulfill the record of our promise here and now."
It was a card I didn’t want to use if possible. But there was no other way. Because on one side, [Baekcheongganggi] as big as a house was coming, and on the other side, the magic waves of the Outer Gods were coming.
With the order to fulfill the contract, a pillar of light rose from the center of the snowfield.
<#>【Ahahahaha! You finally kept your promise with me!】
Asmodeus appeared in a pitch-black gothic dress, along with a gorgeous blue.
<!>[The Recorder of Fear 'Demon King of the Cinema' agrees to a contract with you.]
And the next moment, Asmodeus, who had grasped the situation, glared at me and screamed.
<#>【Oh, damn Kim Dokja!】
A huge explosion occurred.
