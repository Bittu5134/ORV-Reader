<title>590 Episode 7. Trauma (3)
The 'next turn' that Yoo Joonghyuk was referring to was the one I was currently in.
<&>「41st turn.」
Yoo Joonghyuk said.
In this turn, everything in the universe will be destroyed permanently.
My heart raced.
What the hell does that mean?
I couldn't stop thinking about the disconnected footprints in the middle of the snowfield.
<!>[Your mental state is extremely unstable!]
<!>['Incite' is shaking.]
With a light spark, the memory became noisy.
My normal vision scattered, and before I knew it, Anna Croft was standing in front of me.
<&>「Who.......」
The Great Demon's Eye glowed in one of her glaring pupils. Something went wrong.
<&>「......are you?」
I was caught off guard. The power of the [Incite] had weakened, and my disguise as Cheon Inho had been shattered.
<&>「You're...... You're not Cheon Inho.」
The fog around me started to disperse faster.
The moment Anna Croft reached out to me with an urgent look on her face.
<&>「Anna, stop coming around.」
Along with the unfamiliar voice, I heard the snap of someone's fingers, and with that sound, my vision went black for a moment. And then.
Peok.
Something hit me in the back of the head. I turned around in dizzying pain, and there stood a woman holding the 'Damaged Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick'.
"Huh? Inho-ssi?"
It was Jung Heewon.

***

It was an unheard choice to give the 'Damaged Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick' which was cloned with the 'Idea' to Jung Heewon.
She was the only one of the group who didn't fall into the 'Phantom Prison'.
"The monsters were a little weird. They didn't attack me, they just stared at me......."
"What did you do?"
"I got creeped out, so I closed my eyes and swung at them, and they stopped......."
I looked down at the crumpled Specter and sighed. Jung Heewon scolded me.
"You could have told me more beforehand."
It would have been nice, but I hated the fact that the moment I told her, I would have to explain why I knew that.
Once again, I felt the wisdom of Kim Dokja's words.
"I didn't know for sure either. What about the others?"
"I laid them over there."
I turned my head and saw Dansoo ahjussi stretched out and Kyung Sein curled up in a ball.
"It's been like that since earlier."
I was surprised. Dansoo ahjussi was holding the original copy of the 'Damaged Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick', and Kyungsein was holding 'Samyeongdang's Beads'.
Even though I gave them each an item with magic resistance, it wasn't enough.
Still reeling from the shock of their Phantom Prison, Dansoo ahjussi grunted like a sick man, while Kyung Sein crouched down and repeatedly asked not to hit her.
I sat next to them and wiped their sweaty foreheads.
Kyung Sein and Lee Dansoo.
These were the people who proved their 'value' in the infamous first scenario.
They weren't afraid to look at the corpses of people, and they fought bravely against those terrifying ground rats.
Maybe that's why I vaguely thought they would be okay.
<&>「They're just ordinary readers.」
It wasn't the monsters nor the killing, it was the reality they lived in that brought down those two who stood up to the scenarios.
<&>「Ordinary people who were unfortunate enough to be transmigrated into this world.」
I felt my heart grow cold again.
What was I going to do with them? Was I going to raise them, soothe them, train them, and take them on some exciting adventure?
Kyung Sein slowly opened her eyes and looked up at me.
"U-uuh......?"
He¹ sat up shakily and looked around anxiously.
<?>[1] Basically, they almost never use pronouns in Korean so until now Lee Hakhyun only called her by her name when talking about her or didn't use any pronouns. In this sentence, he used "he". Since he normally refers to her as a girl or only says she has a muscular man soul, and Kyung Sein didn't have any problems using female specific terms either, like calling Jung Heewon, I'll leave it as she/her.
It was as her tormentor was still lurking somewhere in the darkness.
I patted her on the back and said.
"Sein-ssi, we've got all the Specters. We've recovered the Specter's Stones. You're safe now, just breathe slowly."
Kyung Sein, who was breathing heavily, let out a slightly sobbing voice.
"Inho-ssi......."
"Yes."
"Kim Dokja...... went through something like this. He overcame something like this."
Clearly, Kim Dokja is a great person. The more time I spend in this world, the more I realize that.
"You overcame it too, Sein-ssi."
Kyung Sein shook her head helplessly and asked.
"Are you okay, Inho-ssi?"
"Fortunately."
"How did...... Do you really have a 'Fourth Wall' or something?"
"It's just that my life didn't have many ups and downs. Ahjussi, are you awake?"
Checking my face, Dansoo ahjussi burst into tears.
"Alive."
I don't know what he was dreaming about, but he grabbed my arm and wiped the tears away.
"Hurry up...... Let's go to the next station."
I don't know what he was dreaming about.
But I know what he wanted to find in this world when he woke up.
"We're almost in Chungmuro. You'll find her soon enough."
Going to Chongmuro would start the third scenario, and once that was over, we would be able to interact with the other stations in earnest.
We'll find out Jiyoon's news soon enough.
"Don't worry, I'll find her no matter what."
Ahjussi nodded weakly.
"Then let's get moving."
As I helped Dansoo ahjussi to his feet, Jung Heewon also helped Kyung Sein up.
Jung Heewon asked.
"Will it be okay? We should let them rest a little longer......."
"It's better to rest when we get to the station. The tunnel is dangerous."
After only three stops, the two were exhausted.
Jung Heewon, who was walking beside me, asked in a small voice.
"Inho-ssi."
"Yes."
"You're not overdoing it, are you?"
"No."
Dansoo ahjussi's arms were damp with cold sweat.
<!>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' looks at the group worriedly.]
<!>[The constellation 'Pig Living in a Brick House' cheers you on.]
Some readers may have encountered Specter in other regions.
I wonder if they survived.
<!>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' watches you.]
If they died somewhere in this world, whose fault were their deaths?
Whoever brought them into this world's? Or—
<&>「"There is no way such a villain exists in this world."」
I felt faintly dizzy, and I could smell blood somewhere.
Was this another Specter?
Or did I never escape from the 'Phantom Prison'?
"Wait. There's something...... wrong."
Dansoo ahjussi said hesitantly.
There was a squishy feeling on my toes. When the smartphone's flash lit up on the floor, it revealed a bloody railroad track. Strewn about were the bodies of neither man nor monster.
"Ugh."
Kyung Sein held back her nausea and raised her shield, while Jung Heewon's expression hardened and she grabbed the 'Damaged Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick' that was made with the 'Idea'.
But there was no sign of [⬜⬜] being triggered yet.
If the situation was truly dangerous, the color of the world would have changed first.
"Let's move forward slowly. It's not too bad yet."
I took the lead and began to move forward, clearing the railroad tracks.
Some of the dead outer species on the ground looked familiar. They resembled the Ratmen we'd encountered in the 'Edge of Darkness'. There were also some that resembled the reptilian creatures Bang Cheolsoo had mentioned.
There must have been some kind of war for so many of them to die at once.
Most of the bodies bore bullet holes.
"Mate."
Dansoo ahjussi called out to me.
A light was shining some distance away.
"Ugh, there."
As Kyung Sein spoke, a girl doll was seen under the dim light.
Long hair on a ponytail.
"Ah......."
The moment Kyung Sein saw her, she stopped dead in his tracks, as if she'd been electrocuted.
And for good reason.
Running into that little girl was proof that we had finally arrived at Chungmuro.

+
The second <Kim Dokja's Company> member I meet in the 41st turn.
Yoo Joonghyuk's first sword, and the incarnation of Maritime War God Yi Sunsin.
The only survivor of Daepong Girls' High School, Lee Jihye.
Wearing her trademark hood zipped-up, she stamped her foot on the railroad tracks and looked toward Chungmuro Station.
Jung Heewon whispered.
"Do you know her?"
Not yet.
If I had to say something.
"She's the disciple of a bastard I know."
It was then that the indirect message came to mind.
<!>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is touched at meeting an old companion.]
I realized that the same message was in the main story of Omniscient Reader.
The problem was the message that came back.
<!>[Lee Jihye's sponsor warns the 'Bald General of Justice' to go back quickly because it's dangerous here.]
Dangerous?
<!>[Main Scenario #2 - Meeting has ended.]
<!>[The compensation will be settled.]
I tossed the reward message aside and looked back at the group.
"I'll take the lead."
Neither Kyung Sein nor Dansoo ahjussi were in any condition to fight.
For now, I must take the lead.
Just then, Lee Jihye, who was crossing her arms in the distance, looked over.
"Oh? What's that?"
Lee Jihye gripped the hilt of her sword, and Jung Heewon stepped forward as if to protect me.
I approached with both my hands raised to show that I meant no hostility.
"Hello. We're from Geumho Station."
"You can't go through here, so go back."
Look at that.
Another twist from the original.
"We have no ill intentions. We'd like to join Chungmuro. Can you please accept us?"
At this point, Chungmuro would be in the middle of the third scenario, 'Green Zone'.
'Green Zone' is a scenario in which you must occupy a 'Green Zone' on the station or be hunted by monsters every night.
Since Lee Jihye is a rival of Gong Pildu, the ruler of Chungmuro Station, there was no reason for her to stop us.
"Master told me not to let anyone come here."
Yoo Joonghyuk?
"Is Yoo Joonghyuk in Chungmuro?"
"Do you know my Master?"
"I do."
"Then why didn't you say so earlier?"
As Lee Jihye's eyes widened, she smiled and took a step closer.
"Master told me to kill all the bastards who knew him."
"Heewon-ssi!"
At the same time I shouted Jung Heewon's name instinctively, Lee Jihye's figure disappeared.
Kagagagak!
Jung Heewon's ground rat knife, which was imbued with [Kendo], accurately stopped Lee Jihye's [Sword Training].
Surprised, Lee Jihye muttered.
"Wow, look at this unni."
Despite the fact that Jung Heewon's overall stats were higher than in the original, Lee Jihye and Jung Heewon were still neck and neck.
This meant that Lee Jihye was also stronger than at the same point in the original.
"Heewon-ssi! Buy me a few minutes! Please!"
At my shout, Jung Heewon threw something at me.
"Take this!"
It was the 'Damaged Samyeondang's Bamboo Stick' made by the 'Idea'.
I quickly snatched up the Bamboo Stick and said to the two people behind me.
"Stay here for a moment."
As I passed by, Lee Jihye shouted in a sharp voice.
"Hey! Stop!"
According to the original, Chungmuro is currently on Day 2 of the 'Green Zone' scenario.
It wasn't odd for Yoo Joonghyuk to be in Chungmuro.
The problem is that this is the unrivaled 41st turn Yoo Joonghyuk.
I could hear a light explosion coming from Chungmuro Station.
I sped up my pace, shrugging off the ominous premonition. A dozen steps later, the Chungmuro platform came into view.
The first thing I saw was a large hole in the center of the platform floor, and people hiding in the stairwells and other places.
The terrified citizens were all looking at the two men who were fighting on the hole in the platform.
One, needless to say, was Yoo Joonghyuk.
The problem was the person on the other side.
"Damn you. How dare you cross my land?"
You know the drill.
The short-tempered Yoo Joonghyuk has gotten into a fight with Gong Pildu.
Fortunately, the fight doesn't seem to be a full-fledged fight yet, so there's still hope.
"Ahjussi, kill him quickly."
A boy's voice came from behind Gong Pildu.
At the same time, Gong Pildu nodded.
"Yes. I was about to."
I wondered if he's already made this area his [Private Property]. Mini-turrets rose from his [Armed Zone] all at once.
Seven turrets in total.
It was two more than in the 3rd turn of Omniscient Reader.
But that's not enough to stop Yoo Joonghyuk.
Kooooo.
This is because in the 40th turn, Yoo Joonghyuk is a monster that has already surpassed the narrative-grade constellations.
The moment he holds the spear, Gong Pildu will certainly die.
<!>[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' wants to do something unexpected].
<!>[The activation conditions for the exclusive skill '⬜⬜' has been met.]
<!>[You have entered the 'Snowfield'.]
Luckily, the 'Snowfield' was triggered.
In the image that went colorless, the mini-turret began charging, and Yoo Joonghyuk held the spear handle in his hand.
It was a close call.
I have to change the story somehow.
But.
<!>[You have an absurdly low understanding of that character.]
<!>[You can't intervene in the character's actions.]
Damn it.
I've seen this message before.
A few days ago, when the poisonous rhinoceros appeared, I entered the Snowfield, apparently because of that 'Yoo Joonghyuk's unexpected behavior.
Back then and now, I couldn't write a sentence.
I don't know what kind of person Yoo Joonghyuk is in the 41st turn.
All I know is that he was portrayed as an extremely vicious being in 'Ways of Survival'.......
<!>[Do you want to check the reader's feedback?]
I checked the feedback.
+
rlaehrwk99: But is the 41st turn Yoo Joonghyuk really that bad?
rlaehrwk37: There is no such thing as a bad Yoo Joonghyuk in the world.
+
And the moment I read that comment.
<!>[Your understanding of the character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has increased slightly.]
Something strange happened.

Author's Note
There's no such thing as a bad person who eats soil
