<title>752 Episode 31 Yoo Jonghyuk (4)
After 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' left, a message was released.
<!>[Due to the scenario's direct change, the start date of the 'Zodiac Ball' is adjusted.]
<!>[The 'Zodiac Ball' will begin in 12 hours.]
<!>[Currently, 71% of the prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]
<!>[To participate in the 'Zodiac Ball' you must secure an additional 9%.]
In the process of fighting the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake', our approval rating actually rose despite the fact that a huge number of prisoners died.
"I never thought there would be an incarnation that could stand against the <Zodiac>…"
Someone had expectations of us.
"Zone 13 is in the spotlight because of you guys."
Someone criticized us.
"I think it would be a good idea to leave Zone 13 at this point."
Some people advised us to give up on Zone 13.
He was the crane owner in 「The Fox and the Crane」.
"I would welcome any of the zodiac signs. I have never seen such an outstanding incarnation at Zone 13 of the 'Recycling Center'."
According to the system, the story of exterminating the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' was widely known throughout Star Stream through the center director.
<!>[Your new tale spreads widely throughout the <Star Stream>.]
<!>[Some constellations were greatly impressed by your story.]
<!>[18,000 coins were donated through the 'Recycling Center'.]
As evidence, messages were still being delivered in real time.
<!>[A few nebulae want you to join them.]
<!>[The nebula <Hongik> invites you.]
<!>[The nebula <Tamra> invites you.]
<!>[The nebula <Samyo> invites you.]
…
The small and medium-sized nebulae that were being pushed out by the large nebulae sent me messages to do business with me.
Among them, there were even <Hongik> and <Tamna>, the nebulae of the Korean Peninsula.
I was curious because it was nebulae that did not appear properly in the main story, but I had no intention of choosing them here.
This was because we were still trapped in the 'Recycling Center' and the scenario related to the <Zodiac> was still in progress.
<!>[The faction 'Monkey God' invites you to the 'Zodiac Ball'.]
<!>[The faction 'Dragon God' invites you to the 'Zodiac Ball'.]
Some factions of the Zodiac also sent invitations to me, as if word had spread that I had declined the tiger's invitation.
"I have no intention of entering <Zodiac>.»
But I didn't come this far just to join that animal union.
"I will attend the 'Zodiac Ball' without anyone’s sponsorship."
I needed the support of eighty percent of the prisoners.
And that was the reason why I was now meeting the crane owner.
"Many prisoners, including me, are already supporting you."
The crane owner, who already knew my situation, sighed lightly and continued.
"But there has never been a representative whose approval rating exceeded 80% in Zone 13."
"Just because it’s never happened doesn’t mean it’s impossible."
"Now the only ones left are the bears and some other beastmen. But it will be difficult to gain their support."
The prisoners nearby are all supporting me. The only exceptions were the bears that followed the Tiger, and their subordinate forces.
But no matter what I did, I could not persuade them.
"Because they don’t have any stories left that you can repair."
The prisoners who we were able to persuade all had 'forgotten stories'.
We revived those stories through 「Staging」and spread them through the <Star Stream>.
The prisoners supported us in return. But in the case of the bear beastmen, that was impossible.
"Is there no way?"
"Honestly, there is none. Wouldn’t it be great if you were a constellation like the 'Master of Fables'? Isn’t it impossible to give individual stories to all of them?"
"If it's the owner of fables, you're probably referring to the constellation that wrote 'Aesop's Fables'."
"That’s right. We don’t have enough time."
"They are not people who can listen by simply threatening them with force. In particular, the 'bear that will spare you if you pretend to be dead' is a constellation with strong pride."
He looked down at Yoo Jonghyuk, who was sleeping soundly on the bed, and added:
"Perhaps there is a 'story' that can sweep them all away at once. Can you help me with this?"
I helped the crane owner  wake Yoo Jonghyuk up from his sleep and fed him some soup. It was a special soup with the story of 「The Fox and the Crane」.
He's the kind of guy who never eats food made by someone else, so I was glad he was unconscious right now.
After feeding him some soup, Yoo Jonghyuk's pale complexion became a little more lively.
The crane owner sighed lightly and said.
"Anyway, this guy got smaller again, but I was really scared when he cut down the
"I’m glad he's smaller."
"Anyway, take care of him. I’ll come again."
With those last words, the crane owner left the room.
I took a few bites of the soup the owner left behind and looked at Yoo Jonghyuk who was sleeping for a moment.
After that incident three days ago, Yoo Jonghyuk had been sleeping ever since.
Perhaps due to the side effects of [Story Engraving], Yoo Jonghyuk became little Yoo Jonghyuk again.
He wasn't as small as the little Yoo Jonghyuk I saw in the snowfield, but he would probably be like this for a while anyway.
The 41st round was the last round for Yoo Jonghyuk.
He transmitted his experience to his past self through Shin Yoosoung and exited the record of 'Ways of Survival'.
I repeat, no one knows what happened to that guy after he left.
Has he stopped regressing in some way, or has he disappeared forever from his records in some way I don't know?
If he had disappeared from his records, would he have finally achieved his wish?
"Don’t worry too much."
I muttered as I covered the sleeping little boy, Yoo Jonghyuk, with a blanket.
"Because this round won’t be ruined so easily."
The person who starts a story has a responsibility not to give up on it.
I made a promise to Yoo Jonghyuk.
<!>[The story 'Recorder of Things That Will Disappear' responds to your oath.]
This story may not be 『Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World』 or 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』, but it will definitely have the right ending.
Now it was time to go see the end of this round for that conclusion.
***
An hour later, I gathered together the bear beastmen and the beastmen who had not expressed support.
The guys seemed taken aback or confused by my sudden call.
Some even reacted with hostility .
<!>[Why did you call us?]
Their representative was the constellation that invaded this place—'the bear that will spare you if you pretend to be dead'.
<!>[If you're calling us to support you, you'd better give up.]
"Why?"
<!>[Because we have no intention of supporting you.]
"So why?"
<!>[There is no reason to explain that.]
"Of course you will.
I squatted down in my seat and let out a deep sigh. Then I looked up at the guys.
"But you… is it okay for you to continue like that?"
No matter what I say, they won't be persuaded by me.
The reason is obvious.
Because they don't need my help.
What should we do for those who have lost their stories?
Maybe I've been thinking about this problem for quite some time.
Some extras found their own stories on their own. Like Bang Cheolsoo from Geumho Station. Like the mother and daughter. Like the crane owner.
But not everyone could do it like they did.
Some people find their own stories, but others live and die without even knowing what their stories are.
For example, like the bears in front of me right now.
"Honestly, it doesn’t really matter whether you support me or not. I can rise to the top somehow."
<!>[Then why did you call us?]
"To give you one last chance."
I know that not everyone can purely support me.
Kim Dokja also knew that.
No matter what he did, some constellations hated Kim Dokja's story.
Kim Dokja pioneered his life by fighting against that gaze, and eventually it also became his story.
But it wasn't easy for me to accept it.
Maybe it's because I'm a 'writer'.
I wanted to write a perfect story that Kim Dokja had never read and that he didn't know about.
<!>[The story 'Recorder of Things That Will Disappear' responds to your emotions.]
But it was impossible.
I finally realized it as I went through Geumho Station, Chungmuro, the Theater Dungeon, Gwanghwamun, Washington Dome, and the Recycling Center.
There is no story that all the constellations in the world love.
Even more so if it is the story of the 'forgotten round'.
So I accepted.
It's okay even if not all prisoners support me. It's safe to say that they hate the stories I'm going to write.
"This is truly your last chance. Your chance to choose me by yourself."
But I just write stories.
<!>[What does that mean?]
"I don’t think there’s any reason to explain what it means."
<!>[The constellation 'the bear that spares Ones Life if Onepretends to be dead' is outraged!]
Even a constellation that has lost all of its status still has pride.
<!>[How dare a mere incarnation carry beastmen on its back—!]
But he misjudged.
"It’s not just an incarnation."
I grinned and looked at him.
Until a few days ago, its power was threatening. I thought that he would be a difficult enemy to defeat if I did not use 『Staging』.
However.
"Has your eyesight deteriorated and you’ve forgotten how to read stories?"
His status no longer seemed great to me.
I slowly stood up.
<!>[You are currently acting as the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]
<!>[The status of the constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' rests fully upon you.]
As my entire body radiated the majestic energy of stories, bright light began to flow from my incarnation body.
Some of the prisoners who noticed it were frightened and bowed their heads.
"Stand, the constellation…!"
Even the 'bear that will spare One's Life if One pretends to be dead' was looking at me with shocked eyes.
As I lightly placed my hand on the guy's shoulder, his knees slowly began to buckle.
The guy shouted as if he was struggling.
<!>[No matter what you do, it’s useless. We will never do your favor—]
"Oh, did that sound like a request?"
A way to persuade those who have lost their stories, lost their memories, and ultimately lost the ability to read.
"I’ll tell you again. You only have one choice."
The crane owner said. Those who have lost their own stories are just being swept away by other 'stories' like a torrent.
So the only way to persuade them is through 'stories'.
<!>[The story begins 'Incite'.]
So, the method I would choose was decided.
<!>[Support me.]
It becomes the story of 'I will sweep them all away'.
<!>[It must be scary to jump into the scenarios again. I know. That's why I'm saying it.]
I saw the confused beastmen looking up at me one by one. A faint trace of emotion passed through their dead eyes.
<!>[At least as long as you support me, I will be your 'story'. I will fight on your behalf and become a laughingstock for the constellations on your behalf.]
My persuasion was not persuasion.
My words will not be heard in their ears. They are simply overwhelmed by my story and crushed by the status of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.
So their choice now is,
<!>[Just support me. Then at least you will be able to see the end of this world through me.]
In fact, it wasn't a choice.
<!>[Your approval rating begins to rise.]
<!>[Your approval rating has reached a certain level.]
<!>[Currently, 83% of prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]
It was an easy and clear ending.
<!>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is scolding you for not doing this sooner.]
<!>[The constellation 'Reclining Dragon' says that sometimes a decision like that of an 'adventurer who laid an egg' is needed.]
<!>[The constellation 'The One Who Brought Ten Lambs' looks at you sadly.]
And as always, clear cider,
<!>[The constellation 'the bear that spares One's life if Onepretends to be dead' rejects your instigation.]
<!>[The constellation 'the bear that comes back to life if you pretend to be dead' loses his story and chooses to disappear.]
The aftertaste was bitter.
<!>[You have obtained permission to attend the 'Zodiac Ball'.]
