<title>648 Episode 18 Father (6)
In the <Star Stream>, everything exists as a story.
<!>[Incite was a skill that imitated the shell of such a story.]
What kind of tone he uses, what actions he does, and what kind of expressions he makes.
A skill that deceives the incarnations by copying the shell, and even deceives the <Star Stream>.
However, this skill ultimately failed to follow the essence of the story.
<!>[The skill is linked with your memory.]
However, the awakened [Incite] made that impossible possible to some extent.
The skill I'm using now was proof of that.
<!>[The exclusive skill 'Tame Lv.9' is activated!]
<&>「Following the path of the aura that extended to Queen Mirabad, Shin Yoosoung completely approached the body of the queen.」
Reading the story of someone's life, internalizing the story, and calling myself 'that person' with [Incite].
In other words, it was close to a kind of [stage painting] with my body as the background.
The sentences Shin Yoosoung endured flowed through my head in real time, and I was living the scene once again.
<&>「The Queen looked at Shin Yoosoung, and Shin Yoosoung looked at her fist.」
The difference is that it is not 'Shin Yoosoung' and 'Queen Mirabad' who are reproducing the story now, but 'I' and the 'Ancient Nagak'.
Blood poured from my nose with the feeling of a push shot.
This was the feeling of connecting with the monster. The sense [taming] that Shin Yoosoung always repeated.
Oh oh oh.
The Ancient Nagak resisted by waving its legs randomly, and I did not let go of the bond of sympathy while avoiding its attack.
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Advanced Multispecies Sympathy Lv.3' is activated!]
<&>「Stopstopstopstopstop」
It felt like one mind had differentiated into two bodies.
At that moment, I was the Ancient Nagak, and the Ancient Nagak was me.
My heart that wants to tame the Ancient Nagak and the Ancient Nagak that fears me.
Two hearts were coexisting.
Like when I heard the language of the puppies one day, countless sentences rushed into my head.
<&>「Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!」
Words that are more like screams.
<&>「Dokkaebiscarydokkaebiscarydokkaebiscary」
It was only then that the expression on the boy's face, which I could hardly read, caught my eye.
I've always thought he was laughing at me or being dangerous.
<&>「Do not come」
But he was afraid of me. Not exactly me, but Shin Yoosoung.
<!>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is curious about the taste of 'Raw Horn Meat'.]
6th-grade monsters are scary to early incarnations. However, from the point of view of the constellations, incarnations and 6th-grade monsters were the same bugs.
<!>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' says that when he was born, it was easy to have about 100 horns.]
<!>[The constellation 'Maritime Admiral' says that there was no 'Field of Nagaks' at that time.]
<!>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' makes fun of the conversation between the stars.]
A constellation is, after all, a constellation.
They are here to see the story. I and the Ancient Nagak had to spend our lives for them to survive.
We were the same.
<&>「Don'tcomedon'tcomedon'tcome」
It seemed that it would finally understand.
<!>[Exclusive skill, 'Taming Lv.9' is activated!]
Blood came out of my nose once again. My head felt like it would explode from the intense fear felt by the monster, and my breathing became rougher and rougher.
Shin Yoosoung has continued [taming] in this compulsory sympathy hell every time.
By listening to them, understanding them, and finally becoming them in order to tame beings different from herself.
<&>「Beast Lord, Shin Yoosoung.」
The only thing that can understand a monster is the same monster.
Even though she was a child, Shin Yoosoung understands monsters better than anyone else.
Perhaps it was only natural that she recognized Kim Dokja, who had become a disaster, before anyone else.
"Don't worry."
As if imitating Shin Yoosoung, I spoke to the Ancient Nagak.
"Because it won't work."
No matter how much I [incited] myself to be Shin Yoosoung who tamed Queen Mirabad, I don't expect that I will be able to tame the Ancient Nagak.
<!>[The character 'Shin Yoosoung' has succeeded in taming a 'Nagak'!]
<!>[The character 'Shin Yoosoung' has succeeded in taming a 'Nagak'!]
All I want is to buy a little more time and have Shin Yoosoung tame 100 Nagaks.
So, to escape this dungeon together.
<!>[Taming failed.]
<!>['Advanced Multiplespecies Sympathy' is preserved.]
He didn't easily tame me, and I didn't tame him either.
But that's how we confronted each other.
Neither friend nor foe.
<!>[The 6th-grade sea species 'Ancient Nagak' is glaring at you.]
Because this confrontation is the only way to endure this moment without hurting each other.
How many minutes had we stared at each other like that?
<!>[The 6th-grade sea species 'Ancient Nagak' does not show hostility towards you.]
For the first time, a change occurred in our tense relationship.
<!>[The 6th-grade sea species 'Ancient Nagak' is curious about you.]
Did he feel relief from my attitude? The lumbering guy's dwelling landed on the floor as if he had lost his will to fight. I could feel the air in preparation for the ensemble escaping from his body.
In an instant, a small glimmer of hope rose up.
Maybe it's possible?
<!>[Your magic power is running low.]
But my mana was running out. It would have been a little better if I had consumed a magic recovery potion, but it was not possible.
I just had a hard time maintaining this [Incite] state.
<&>「What Ahjussi is doing right now.」
At some point, the sentences that came to my mind changed.
<&>「Should we think about it?」
Shin Yoosoung’s height, weight, what she likes, what she wants to eat, and what she dislikes, hobbies or specialties, favorite cartoon, favorite novel, person she likes, what she thinks when she looks at a person.
The more the [Incite] continued, the more I felt like I was being eaten up little by little by the value of that information.
Tsutsutsutsut.
Eventually, my magical power disappeared, [Tame] and [Advanced Communication] were canceled at the same time. On the other hand, [Incite] was still unresolved.
<&>「Ahjussi.」
I couldn't stop thinking about something else.
This [Incite] was not a skill I could handle.
The Ancient Nagak, whose sympathy had been released, was approaching in front of me.
<&>「You know.」
Is this the inside of Shin Yoosoung?
<&>「I really want to see you.」
Or is it an unwritten story?
<&>「But.」
What happened to Shin Yoosoung?
Is [taming] over?
Can we escape?
<&>「I really hate you.」
Shin Yoosoung.
<&>「I really, really hate you.」
I.
<!>[6th-grade sea species Ancient Nagak prepares for a 'wide-area ensemble'!]
I thought I should stop it, but my voice won't come out.
My body doesn't listen.
My thoughts do not flow normally.
My body, unable to overcome the Incite, was collapsing.
I thought someone was approaching me, but I heard a voice.
"Ahjussi, I did it. I tamed them all."
I turned to where the voice came from and asked.
"Who…"
There stood a child with a smile.
"Me? Shin Yoosoung!"
"Shin Yoosoung... Me?"
The child tilted her head.
<!>[A side effect of Excessive Incite has occurred!]
"…Ahjussi?"
The child looked at me for a long time, then she smiled faintly.
<!>[6th-grade sea species 'Ancient Nagak' starts 'wide ensemble'.]
"Ah. You tried to tame him."
The child said, "Hey," and she snorted, then stretched out her hand toward the Ancient Nargak with the back of my hand clasped.
"But that's not how you do it."
A thread of dim light stretched out from the child's fingertips, and was soon connected with the Ancient Nagak.
I stared blankly at the scenery. I couldn't figure out what was going on.
<!>[The character 'Shin Yoosoung' has tamed the Ancient Nagak!]
<!>[There are no Nagaks left in the 'Field of Nagak'.]
<!>[After a while, the dungeon will be forcibly closed.]
<!>[After a while, all personnel will be banished to the lobby.]
How did she do it?
I couldn't believe it.
What I couldn't do, how can you do it so simply?
I'm sure she was a kid who had a hard time taming 'Nagaks' until a little while ago.
My mouth moved on its own.
"Shin... Yoosoung..."
The child happily nodded her head.
"Yes! It's me."
"You are...Shin Yoosoung."
"Are you Ahjussi?"
Shin Yoosoung tilted her head once again, then gave a small smile. Then she reached out her hands and cupped my cheeks, and she began to slap me from both sides.
"No! I'm Shin Yoosoung! Take care of yourself!"
<!>[The influence of Incite gradually weakens.]
I blankly looked down at the child and asked.
"Then... who am I...?"
Who I was.
Surely, it must have been something, but why can't I remember it?
I am.
"Who is your ahjussi?
The child held my cheeks tightly with both hands. The child's eyes were shining gold.
The child who slowly brought her lips to my ear whispered in a disturbing voice.
"My ahjussi is Kim Dokja."
<!>['Incite' is canceled.]
I lost consciousness.
***
"You still faint every day, ahjussi."
Shin Yoosoung laid Cheon Inho neatly on the floor and gently brushed his ragged hair.
"But why do you have to be Cheon Inho?"
Shin Yoosoung took a look at Cheon Inho's face and then licked her lips.
"Is it because of ahjussi’s body? I think he's a bit handsome."
<!>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer' is glaring at you.]
<!>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer' asks when did you possess it.]
"I hear an insect crying somewhere."
<!>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer' is indignant!]
<!>[The constellation ' Sneaky Schemer' says this is unfair!]
Shin Yoosoung smiled.
—Then, do you want to be a character too?
<!>[The constellation, 'Sneaky Schemer' says he can't go because he doesn't have someone to possess.]
"It is very noisy. Don't these dokkaebis manage the channel?"
When the child lightly looked up into the air, to her surprise, there was a faint spark.
<!>[The constellation 'Maritime Admiral' is complaining that the screen transmission has been cut off from a while ago!]
<!>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' says he thought only he was broken!]
<!>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' threatens to request a refund from the administration if this continues.]
<!>[The management bureau is checking the local channels.]
While noisy messages were scattered all over the place, Shin Yoosoung looked quietly at the fallen Cheon Inho.
Cheon Inho's face looked very tired.
Cheon Inho was even talking in his sleep, as if he was having a bad dream.
After hesitating for a moment, Shin Yoosoung put her ear closer.
"Please help me, Yoo Jonghyuk-nim."
Shin Yoosoung's expression darkened.
"Is this Yoo Jonghyuk-nim a bit violent?"
<!>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer' says he is violent anywhere.]
Shin Yoosoung looked down at Cheon Inho, who was talking in his sleep, and wore a bitter smile.
"It looks like a lot has happened."
There will be many incidents with him in the future.
Events that are more impressive than the stories he accumulated together may fill his life.
Shin Yoosoung felt that way and she hated herself.
"Ahjussi."
There are many things she wants to ask.
But she also knew that she couldn't get an answer.
<!>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer' says that this man is not the Kim Dokja we know.]
Shin Yoosoung nodded her head.
"I know, I know."
Shin Yoosoung always thought of him when she watched the sky, and imagined dreams when he dreamed.
"This person is also ahjussi."
The two children looked at the fallen Cheon Inho for a long time.
At that time, something sparkling flowed from the Ancient Nagak towards Cheon Inho's body.
<!>[A new 'Failure' is recorded.]
Something very faint and insignificant, but still shining softly.
Shin Yoosoung realized what it was.
"What?"
Clearly, it was a story. Shin Yoosung, her eyes wide open, looked down at Cheon Inho.
"The reason ahjussi came to this world…"
<&>「'Failure' is recorded on the 'last wall'.」
Shin Yoosoung's expression froze.
Something was watching them. A solemn and distant wall on which everything in this world was recorded looked down on them.
<!>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer' growls.]
As if to protect her, Lee Gilyoung stepped forward. The world spoke to them.
<&>「This is not a place assigned to you.」
The dungeon collapsed, and everything faded into the light.
