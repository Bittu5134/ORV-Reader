<title>737 Episode 29 Recorder of Fear (4)
<&>「For me, [Way of the Wind] has already been recorded.」
I wondered what that meant.
Since I am also a part of Kim Dokja, does this mean that Kim Dokja's story is sleeping within me?
Kim Dokja had no talent for anything else, but he had a talent for storytelling.
Even when the 'Demon King of Salvation' descended on me, he used that talent to fight.
Then why can’t I use [Way of the Wind]?
Several hypotheses came to mind, but the most reliable way to verify them was to ask the person making the statement directly.
"What does that mean?"
Lycaon, who had been groaning, slowly opened his mouth.
<#>【◼️◼️◼️ ◼️…】
A strong spark flew out along with the sound of Tsutsutsu. Lycaon frowned.
Is this filtering as expected? I wondered when information I couldn't hear would come out.
Perhaps it is related to the end of this world line. I don’t know how Lycaon knows that information, but…
Lycaon thought for a moment and said this.
<#>【Student. It is reading records that have not yet been written. I could tell you, but now is not the time.】
To put it simply, it goes against probability.
<#>【As you know, the very fact that I am here now is against probability.】
Not yet now. In the sky, the Constellations of the Chinese zodiac were gathering together to hold a contest.
<!>[Some Constellations belonging to the Nebula <Zodiac> are asking why that wolf does not return to the other world.]
<!>[Some Constellations from the Nebula <Zodiac> request a 'probability suitability judgment'.]
<!>[Some of the Constellations of the Nebula <Zodiac> question whether it makes sense for an 'Outer God' to intervene in the scenario.]
<!>[The Bureau is currently reviewing the matter.]
System messages emerging in real time.
But I wasn't particularly shaken or embarrassed.
<!>[The Dokkaebi 'Bihyung' admits that the existence of the Outer God is probable.]
<!>[Some Constellations in the Nebula <Zodiac> question whether that makes sense.]
<!>[The Management Bureau certifies that there is no problem in the matter.]
This was because Lycaon’s current existence did not conflict with the probability of <Star Stream>.
<!>[A few Constellations in the Nebula <Zodiac> are puzzled by the Management Bureau’s judgment.]
It must be embarrassing for the Constellations.
<!>[The Constellation 'Reclining Dragon' is observing you with curious eyes.]
If you think about common sense, their decision was right. Regardless of the status of the 'God of the Other World', it was improbable that the 'God of the Other World' existed in only the eighth scenario.
But they won't know.
What kind of 'covenant' did Lycaon and I make?
<!>[You have currently entered into an Outer World covenant with the 'Lost Guide'.]
A lost guide.
That was the pseudonym of 'Lycaon Isparang', who became the god of another world.
<!>[The 'Otherworld Covenant' you currently have with the 'Lost Guide' is as follows.]
+
* The 'Lost Guide', a deity from another world, stays in 'Zone 13' of the Recycling Center for a total of 30 days based on the 'lower floor of the Recycling Center'.
* During the residency period, the 'Lost Guide' will not directly interfere with the scenario.
* The 'Lost Guide' will not protect you during your residency.
* While the 'Lost Guide' resides in the area, you must supply him with the story of「The Three Little Pigs」in return.
* The 'Lost Guide' can teach you and your companions [Way of the Wind] during your stay.
* Even if you do not master [Way of the Wind], the 'Lost Guide' does not take any responsibility for this.
+
This was the entire 'Otherworld Covenant' I made with Lycaon.
The summary of the contract was as follows.
<&>「For the next 30 days, Lycaon will exist as a 'wind doll' next to me.」
Aside from being able to teach me the [Way of the Wind], he can't help me at all, and he doesn't even protect me when the Constellations attack.
In fact, at the time of signing the contract, Lycaon asked this question.
—Student… Are you really a fanatic?
I answered with a grin.
"Anyway, it would be impossible to conclude a contract with other details."
Around the eighth scenario, I started to see something.
There are limits to the 'otherworldly covenant' that can be made in a scenario of this scale.
—Student will gain nothing by proceeding with this covenant. Considering student's talent, even learning the [Way of the Wind] is not guaranteed...
"It is a condition that was intentionally put in place. The more unfavorable the terms of the covenant are, the higher the probability that it will not go against probability."
If you just read the contents, I really could have gained nothing from this covenant and ended up only losing my stake in the story.
But it wasn't really that bad.
"Instead, this condition must never be made known to the Constellations."
Because that was the core of this 'otherworldly covenant'.
<!>[The Constellation 'Reclining Dragon' realizes your trick and is amazed.]
<!>[The Constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon of the Abyss' asks what is going on.]
<!>[The Constellation 'Reclining Dragon' says it's not fun to say that.]
It seems like Waryong noticed, but it doesn't matter.
They can visit the 'Recycling Center' because 'dragon' is included in their modifier, but they will not interfere with the work of the <Zodiac>.
<!>[Some Constellations from the Nebula <Zodiac> are targeting the 'Lost Guide'.]
Lycaon, who had been silently receiving the Constellations' gaze, opened his mouth as if he belatedly realized something.
<#>【Student is still the same even if you are reincarnated. You are truly an exceptionally cowardly person.】
"I often hear compliments like that."
My strategy is simple.
<&>「Put up a ‘wind doll’ next to me, but don’t let anyone know it’s a 'wind doll'.」
<#>【The covenant could have failed. Weren’t you afraid?】
Even if it was an 'otherworldly covenant' with unfavorable conditions, if the Dokkaebi in charge was a guy like 'Paul', my plan could have gone wrong.
"I thought it wouldn’t fail."
I knew right away that it was a local Dokkaebi. And above all, this scenario area was the 'Recycling Center'.
<!>[The 'Recycling Center Director' is interested in your scheme.]
Since the name was 'Recycling Center', I believed that the center director would not abandon the 'God of the Other World'. Because the gods of the other world are the ones who need 'recycling' more than any other material in this universe.
<!>[Some Constellations belonging to the Nebula <Zodiac> disobey the management’s judgment…]
It may seem noisy on the outside, but the cowardly Constellations of the Chinese zodiac will not be able to interfere with Zone 13 for 30 days.
The group who had been practicing [Way of the Wind] returned to their lodgings one by one, and the sun began to set in Zone 13.
I opened my mouth as I noticed that the Constellations from the Chinese Zodiac, who were venting their anger in the dark sky, were disappearing one by one.
"Lycaon. Let’s talk about the past for a moment."
I thought it was time to bring up that story.
I was curious about other things, too, but I also wanted to know what happened to Lycaon.
As far as I know, Lycaon went missing around the time the 'Disasters of Floods' descended.
But how was it possible for Lycaon to become a 'God From Another World' and descend to this world line?
<#>【That...】
If we figure out how he did that, we might be able to get clues about other enemies that exist in this world line.
"Is that also a record that hasn’t been written yet?"
Lycaon seemed to think about it for a moment, but then he opened his mouth.
<#>【It's not a very interesting record, but if you don't mind.】
***
The story returns to the 'Disaster Scenario', the fifth scenario of the 1,864th round.
At that time, Lycaon was swept away by the explosion of the 'Disaster of Questions' while fighting with Antinus, the 'Queen of the Parasites', another guide.
Lycaon, who lost consciousness, was mentally controlled by Antinus and was liberated after meeting Lee Gilyoung.
<&>「"This is the first time I've seen a bug like you! "」
After 'Antinus' was eliminated by Lee Gilyoung, Lycaon's body began to die.
<&>「The 'Guide' cannot bear the power of a disaster.」
It was due to the aftereffects of the explosion of the 'catastrophe meteorite'. The durability of his body had reached its limit, but Lycaon struggled to survive somehow.
<&>「Your tale responds to your will.」
As a result, Lycaon entered a new evolution. He had succeeded in taking a leap forward from being a '5th grade alien species'.
<&>「The new skill 'Restorative Predation' has been acquired.」
<!>[Restorative Predation, which eats the bodies of other monster species and revitalizes their incarnation bodies.]
Just then, the 'Flood Disaster' began and the [Monster Gate] opened, and he was able to survive by eating the bodies of dead monsters.
However, the wounds received from the 'disaster' were not easily healed.
<#>【When I fully recovered, student had already entered the ninth scenario area.】
Ninth scenario, 'Dark Castle'.
<#>【I also followed student into the Dark Castle.】
"You were in the Dark Castle?"
<#>【Yes.】
However, nowhere in 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』 was there any information that Lycaon was there.
Did Han Sooyoung omit that information?
<#>【I only had a chance to meet student once...】
"When?"
<#>【When student fought the 'Dream Eater', student couldn't see me, but I saw student.】
Memories came to mind again and again.
The Dark Castle's 2nd floor. To save his mother Lee Sookyung, Kim Dokja fought alongside Yoo Joonghyuk against the 'Dream Eater'.
<#>【Even now, the student of those days is vivid in my eyes.】
Lycaon's eyes twinkled dimly.
<#>【Some stories, regardless of their level, sometimes captivate your being just by watching them. If you are someone like me who doesn't have your own ◼️◼️, you are even more vulnerable to it.】
Under the dazzling light of the mortal stars, Lycaon made a decision.
<#>【I thought that since student gave me enlightenment, I should also repay my debt.】
"Wait a minute, no way."
<#>【Yes. When student was swallowed up by the 'Dream Eater', I also entered into it.】
"Did you meet Kim Dokja there?"
<#>【No, unfortunately I couldn't meet student. This is because the 'Dream Eater’s' stomach was too wide.】
The 'Dream Eater' is a powerful deity from another world.
Its stomach was so large that it was located outside of outer space.
So, it was not strange that Lycaon and Kim Dokja could not meet.
"But the 'Dream Eater' would have died in the end. No, not exactly—"
If I remember correctly, the 'Dream Eater' is eventually absorbed into the [Fourth Wall] and becomes a librarian at the library.
However, Lycaon was inside the stomach of such a 'Dream Eater'.
<#>【Yes. That was the problem. That's where the story gets a little complicated. I was trapped in the stomach of the 'Dream Eater' who was eaten by the [Fourth Wall].】
"No, what…"
It was harsh. While trying to save Kim Dokja, he got trapped in the stomach of an Outer God.
<#>【I was trapped inside for a very long time.】
"…Sorry."
<#>【I don't know why you're apologizing, but it wasn't a very bad time. I was able to watch your story through the tales read by the 'Dream Eater'.】
Only then did I understand.
The reason why he knows the story of Kim Dokja that he could never know.
"How long have you been there?"
<#>【Until student saw the '◼️◼️' of everything.】
"Then after that…"
<#>【The 'Dream Eater' realized my existence too late and released me.】
When he was released, the world line's scenarios had ended.
The bureau collapsed and the story that bound him disappeared.
He, who had been the 'guide' of the scenario, was no longer given a role. And the fate of those who lost their role in this world was determined.
<#>【It was an empty but common ending.】
Most beings in this world die without even finding out what their ◼️◼️ is, let alone reaching it.
Lycaon suffered the same fate.
<#>【If only I hadn’t met that being.】
There was someone who took care of the dying Lycaon.
He exists outside of the scenarios.
<&>「Like the 'Oldest Dream'.」
There Lycaon met one of the 'Great Old Ones'.
