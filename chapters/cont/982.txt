<title>982 Episode 59 What Ending (3)
<@>[Again, I disagree.]
Mitra still looked skeptical. He looked at me as if I were a child, then sighed deeply and added,
<!>[I know you're familiar with 'fears'. But the outer gods within that bush are different from the fears you know.]
I couldn't bring myself to say I knew what those outer gods were, so I just smiled bitterly. Mitra, perhaps interpreting my expression, added in a much more serious tone.
<!>[Even if you've reached the realm of mythology, you shouldn't underestimate the 'gods of the other world'. The beings within that bush are monsters that even I can't guarantee a victory against.]
Yes, yes, of course you would.
"I know."
<!>[And you're still going?]
"Yes."
As Mitra said, the beings within that bush will be dangerous. Above all, I wasn't even sure what kind of <Kim Dokja Company> existed within that bush.
"Still, I have to go."
However, I'd encountered members of <Kim Dokja Company> several times before. Shin Yoosoung, Lee Gilyoung—I'd even seen other members when I briefly possessed kkoma Kim Dokja.
So, whoever the <Kim Dokja Company> was inside, I was certain.
<&>「They wouldn't harm me.」
The name itself was <Kim Dokja Company>. Those who had joined a nebula with that name and endured the scenarios would never harm Kim Dokja or his fragments.
<!>[You... truly cherish your comrades.]
Had he not trusted my resolve until now? Mitra looked somewhat impressed as he spoke.
<!>[The 'Sanctuary' will appear soon!]
Then, a message appeared above my head.
The sky opened as the constellations roared, and a bright beam of light struck the ground. It was a spectacle reminiscent of Thor's thunderbolt. A curtain of light then formed around the lightning bolt that had struck the ground.
<!>[A 'Sanctuary' has been created!]
A five-minute timer floated above the translucent curtain of light.
<!>[Timer created!]
<!>[After the timer expires, participants within the 'Sanctuary' area will be transferred to the 'Main Battlefield'.]
A total of twenty constellations could survive within the 'Sanctuary' area.
Anna Croft, observing the situation, muttered softly.
"This scenario favors the Giant Nebulae."
I agreed. In a battle like this, only the 'Giant Nebulae' could form a coalition of twenty. In other words, the nebula who entered the 'curtain of light' first and prepared for defense was likely to be the winner of this 'battle of the sanctuary'.
Amidst a subtle tension in the battlefield, sparks flew through the air once again, and a dokkaebi appeared. It was a high-ranking dokkaebi I knew well.
<@>[The, the 'sanctuary' has finally appeared!]
Dokkaebi Biryu. The one in charge of the Chungmuro ​​scenario in the 1,864th round. He was dispatched to this 'super-large battlefield'.
<!>[But, if we continue like this, it seems a bit unfair, doesn't it?]
Several constellations cried out in thought at the ominous dokkaebi's words.
<@>[What do you mean?]
<!>[If you're going to do something stupid—]
Biryu, with a mischievous grin, snapped his fingers. Then, the 'curtain of light' in the sanctuary began to split.
<!>[D-don't threaten! T-This way, the strong nebulae will have an advantage. I-If we spread them out like this… hehehehehe!]
The 'sanctuary', which had been built to allow the group to unite and defend, was fragmenting and splitting apart. This time, it was a scene I knew well.
<&>「Green Zone.」
Like the dozens of 'Green Zones' that had appeared at Chungmuro ​​Station, the effective area of ​​the sanctuary was split into a dozen or so.
<!>[The 'effective area' of the 'sanctuary' is fragmenting!]
Like the 'Green Zone', the effective area varied in size. Some areas were barely large enough for one person, while others were perfect for two or three.
<@>[Some constellations are greatly embarrassed by the altered scenario!]
<!>[A few constellations are satisfied with the altered scenario!]
In a sense, Biryu's 'fairness' was effective. Certainly, this would make it difficult for a single, massive nebula to occupy all the 'sanctuary areas'. With so many divided realms, opportunities also arose for other constellations. A fierce battle to seize that seat of light would rage.
<@>[See you again, Junkyung's disciple.]
The first to move was the Sun Hunter, Ye. He stood firm in a single-square valid area, ready to attack anyone, aiming his massive bow.
<!>[The Sun Hunter will accept the challenge of the stars.]
A quiet spirit emanated from his mantra. Even after seeing the white arrows on his bow, no constellation dared to rush at him. Facing him now would be tantamount to facing the Emperor's vassal.
Several constellations, seemingly the remnants of the Emperor, also watched the Sun Hunter closely and took up positions in the nearby sanctuaries.
Mitra was the next to speak.
<!>[Everyone, prepare for the scenario.]
It seemed as if Mitra, too, was planning to use this 'sanctuary' to send his subordinates up.
<!>[The Chairman—]
<@>[I will go to the 'Missing Bush'.]
At Mitra's answer, the constellations of the 'Golden Dice Hall', including Skuld, became thoughtful.
<!>[Chairman, no. That's too dangerous.]
As if anticipating his subordinates' reaction, Mitra replied with a benevolent smile.
<!>[We will see each other again soon. Everyone, be sure to survive. Even without me, if you join forces, you are strong enough. The protection of the 'Golden Dice Hall' will be with you.]
With that, Mitra pulled out one of his arms and slammed it into the ground.
At the same time, a bright light filled the constellations of the 'Golden Dice Hall', centered on the ground.
<!>[Ohhh...!]
A myth-grade constellation sacrificed one of its arms to create a totem. With this, the constellations of the 'Golden Dice Hall' in the sanctuary area were able to fight under Mitra's protection. Mitra, glancing at his subordinates, turned his large body toward me.
<!>[Then hurry.]
I didn't expect him to truly keep his promise, so I felt a bit bewildered.
"Is it alright to go with me?"
Mitra nodded.
<!>[I'm embarrassed by your courage. As a senior of the mythical rank, I want to fulfill my duty.]
Honestly, it was unexpected, but I felt no need to refuse.
"Then let's go right away."
A war would soon break out over the sanctuary. It would be best to withdraw from here before the noise grew any louder.
I signaled to Jung Heewon and Kim Anna. Just in case, Kim Namwoon had Kim Anna carry him, so I could use Jung Heewon's help if necessary.
"Kim Anna-ssi, take this."
I handed her the ticket I'd kept in my waistband as I entrusted Kim Namwoon to her.
"This—"
"This is a ticket to the 'Main Battlefield'. Take the one for your friend on your back, too."
The ticket was received from the 'Seeker of the End' before entering the 'Valhalla Hall'.
"These are blacklisted tickets, aren't they?"
"If anything, we'll have to use them."
From now on, even I couldn't guarantee safety. If things went even slightly wrong, it would be better to send Anna Croft and Kim Namwoon to a higher scenario.
Anna Croft, examining the tickets, said,
"If I enter with a blacklisted ticket, I'll enter with the forces of calamity."
That's right. If she enters with a blacklisted ticket, Anna Croft will be on the opposite side of the constellations of 'Ragnarok'.
I smiled and asked back,
"Isn't that what you want?"
"…"
"Your goal is to take revenge on the constellations of Asgard, isn't it?"
I could see Anna Croft's shoulders tremble. She bit her lip, as if hesitating, then turned to me and asked.
"You?"
"Me?"
"I'm asking which side you're on."
"Why? Are you going to follow me?"
Anna Croft didn't answer. Feeling grateful for the silence, I smiled and added,
"You know you have to be on the side of 'Calamity' anyway. That must be the 'terms of the contract' with the being who gave you the 'Eye of the Prime Evil'."
Anna Croft's eyes flickered slightly at my words.
"You all knew that."
I nodded.
The being who gave Anna Croft the 'Eye of the Prime Evil' was a constellation that played a key role in this 'Ragnarok'.
Perhaps, with its help, Anna Croft would be reborn as a key player on the 'Calamity' side.
"I will definitely repay my debt."
"I look forward to it."
A roar followed from behind, accompanied by the shouts of the constellations. The battle for the sanctuary had finally begun.
<!>[I'll increase my speed.]
Mitra quickened her pace with a mantra. This guy could move fast, but he deliberately moved slowly.
How many minutes had passed? Finally, a dark, bushy terrain appeared on the other side of the road.
<@>[Over there.]
I felt several constellations chasing us, but none of them rushed, perhaps because they were aware of Mitra.
<!>[We've found the 'Missing Bush'!]
The bush was finally before us.
<&>「If I go inside, I'll find the whereabouts of 'Dansu ahjussi'.」
I took a step toward the bush, catching my breath. But the moment I stood before it, a strange feeling descended. A deep silence fell over us.
"Mitra."
I turned around. Mitra was watching me. I saw Jung Heewon and Anna Croft trapped in a translucent pillar of light. Mitra's power, [Light Prison], had been activated.
<!>[You knew that, didn't you?]
Perhaps Mitra had been stalling for time to exercise that power.
<!>[That I'm a coward.]
I gazed quietly up at Mitra and thought about the existence of a 'myth-grade constellation'. I thought about the star that had been reading a single story for tens of thousands of years, executing its scenario.
"Didn't you say you wanted to escape from the hell of '■■'?"
Becoming a myth in the <Star Stream> might mean becoming the <Star Stream> itself. A being so accustomed to its system that it could no longer escape the <Star Stream>.
<@>[That's right.]
Mitra looked at me with somewhat sad eyes.
<!>[I envy you. I envy your courage to throw it all away and disappear, despite having accumulated such an incredible story.]
As expected, Mitra truly had no intention of helping me. His motive was this:
He simply wanted to use my companion as a hostage at the last moment to make a pact with me.
"What do you want?"
<!>[When you roll the 'dice' at the round table, call my name just once.]
Mitra spoke with a strange madness in his voice.
<!>[If you do that, I will give you anything.]
What he wanted wasn't escape from the 'Hell of ■■'. He was a star that yearned for ■■ more desperately than anyone else. A being who would sacrifice anything to witness the final scene.
<!>[Promise me. Call my true name there. Then I can grant you my 'Power of Resurrection'! If you seek the help of <Vedas>, I will grant that too! So—]
"That."
I looked at Mitra.
"Is it truly your will? Or is it the will of the stories that turned you into a 'myth'?"
