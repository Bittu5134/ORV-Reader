<title>603 Episode 10. Writer (4)
The person who uploaded illegal files pretended to be a writer.
I don't know what the hell the world is like.
<!>[The constellation, 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake', encourages you anyway.]
The reason why he was able to avoid [Lie Detection] was probably because he directly typed “Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint.”
Can he say he “wrote” that?
I thought the decision of [Lie Detection] was absurd, but I suddenly felt funny.
<&>「Then what about me?」
Touching the lemon candy in my pocket, I thought about the real author of this story.
<&>「How much can I say I wrote this story?」
<!>[‘Cinema Journey’, will begin soon.]
Looking back, Jung Heewon, who had finished preparing, asked me.
“Are we going alone?”
“Yes.”
I briefly looked at the other teams. Most of them had filled the three-person limit.
Until the very end, the [Electrical sound] filled with regret lingered in my ears.
—Are you really not going to join us?
—Sorry. Looking forward to the next time.
It was a woman with a steel helmet and an old man with a pipe.
Both teams had excellent power, but if they teamed up, problems could arise in the future scenario.
Above all,
“Let’s see if we live.”
I can't take care of Sein and Dansu ahjussi.
“Take care of yourself too, ahjussi.”
The two formed a team of three with Lee Jihye.
“If you can't follow me, I'll throw you away.”
“Hey, I’ll work hard to follow you!”
Lee Jihye was gruff on the outside, but had a lot of affection in her heart.
Just like in the “Emergency Defense Battle,” Lee Jihye would not ignore the crisis between the two.
Of course, the skills of Sein and Dansu ahjussi are not weak anymore.
There is probably only one old man with a sacred relic of a constellation here.
<!>[Hmm, it looks like everyone is ready.]
The dokkaebi Paul reappeared with the sound of tsutsutsutsu.
<!>[But I see some people who haven't found their own team yet...]
Paul added, taking a light scan of the lobby.
<!>[If you don't have a team, you don't have to worry too much because it's a random match.]
Random matching?
<!>[Starts to enter.]
<!>[You have been appointed as the team's representative.]
<!>[Jung Heewon has joined your team.]
<!>[Jung Jaewoo has joined your team.]
I felt embarrassed. I deliberately didn't accept team members, but I never thought it would be a forced match like this.
“Me, over there. hello.”
A man with a familiar face somewhere awkwardly lowered his head and approached.
Perhaps he is Jung Jaewoo.
“It seems like we’re on the same team… I’ll take good care of you.”
Upon closer inspection, it was the reader who shouted to people earlier, "Who read it?"
I felt sorry for him as if he was shouting out the same words alone, like Kim Dokja, who was always recommending “TWSA.”
Of course, you can't believe it just by looking at it.

I was at a loss for words for a moment.
“Jaewoo-ssi, right? I look forward to it.”
“Please take good care of me too.”
Jung Heewon, who was watching from the side, also gave a short greeting.
Jung Jaewoo may have recognized Jung Heewon, and he lowered his head with a face of regret.
“Me too! It's an honor!”
Rather than teaming up with a stupidly dangerous person, a naive person like this might be better.
Then, a small die appeared in front of my eyes.
<!>[Roll the dice.]
I held the die lightly.
The readers around me who threw the die first spit out swear words.
“Ah, damn it.”
“Is it 1 from the beginning?“
A dark color hovered over the 10 dice that came out. As you can see, the color of the dice changed depending on the number on the dice.
I stared at the die.
If the scenario had progressed further, I could get help by obtaining the [God of Dice], a narrative-grade story.
“I’ll throw it at once.”
After briefly exchanging glances with the party, I threw the die.
“Oh?”
The die glowed golden.
<!>[The number on the die is 6.]
Jung Heewon widened her eyes.
“Are you lucky?”
<!>[Go up the stairs 6 steps.]
<!>[Double Chance! You may roll the die one more time.]
I threw the die again.
<!>[The number on the die is 5.]
<!>[Go up the stairs 5 steps.]
<!>[You have reached the second floor!]
Is 10 steps equal to one floor?
I didn't expect to come to the second floor at once.
Even the luck didn't end there.
<!>[Enter the bonus stage!]
<!>[Each person gets a coin bonus of 1,000!!]
<!>[An additional die chance has been obtained!]
The die appeared again. I rolled the third die.
<!>[The number on the die is 5.]
<!>[Go up the stairs 5 steps.]
<!>[Enter the normal stage!]
<!>[There are no assignments for this stage.]
<!>[After 3 minutes, an extra die chance will be given.]
Does this make sense?
It was an incomprehensible level of luck. As soon as I started, I could roll the die four times in a row.
Jung Heewon asked in surprise.
“Are you suddenly possessed? Are you good at this kind of game?”
In terms of luck, I was generally unlucky.
I had never won a common comment event or cash event once.
“Hmm… I think.”
There are no incidental stories in the <Star Stream>.
In other words, if strange luck suddenly came to me in a row, there must be a probable reason for that luck.
So for example…
“Jaewoo-ssi.”
“Yes.”
“Do you have any passive skills?”
“Ah.”
Jung Jaewoo slightly rolled his eyes and scratched his cheek awkwardly.
“That... can I tell you...”
“If that’s a problem, you don't have to say anything.”
Was he more cautious than I thought?
Seeing that he practiced Kim Dokja’s maxim well, he may have read the entire novel pretty seriously.
“Oh, no. I'll tell you. It's not a skill... I have a trait called [Little Luck].”
I was surprised the moment I heard the characteristic name.
[Little Luck]
Needless to say, it was literally a trait that maximized trivial luck.
<&>「Should I give even the smallest luck to Kim Dokja?」
It was a feature I was worried about.
There was a time when I thought what it would be like to let Kim Dokja grow while evolving his characteristics from [Little Luck] to [Compliant Luck] and [Extreme Luck].
<&>「“Author-nim, there are so many main characters who solve it with luck these days…"」
It was discarded with one word of Ji Eunyu...
But I never thought there would be a reader with that characteristic.
“I don’t know why, but I was originally a little bit lucky.”
Jung Jaewoo smiled brightly and began to tell stories I hadn't asked about.
“When I go to buy bread, there is always one bread left that I want. Or, when I encounter a question I don't know the answer to, if I take it, I get it right... It's not that great, but small luck keeps following me.”
With a shy face, Jung Jaewoo continued to speak.
“So, even after coming here, I was lucky enough to survive several times. I also found a bug on the subway...”
The story of how he evacuated to the ground to avoid a riot at Cheonggu Station, and the brother and sister he met there gave him Elaine Monkey's Lungs (probably the Killer King siblings).
“I asked them to come with me, but they refused.”
He went to the basement of Yaksu Station with his lungs bitten and encountered alien species, and luckily escaped with someone's help (it seems that he met the Misreading Association).
“I almost died then.”
After running away to the ground again, this time he met a rhinoceros in Sidog, and the story that someone killed the rhinoceros and left (Is it Yoo Joonghyuk?).
“The 4 knives were so fast that I couldn't see any of them."
Anyway, after running away so hurriedly, it was even said that when he came to his senses, he was at the Chungmuro ​​Theater before he knew it.
“There are a lot of readers here, so I feel relieved.”
I blankly looked at Jung Jaewoo.
There really are people like this.
A really lucky man.
“Hey, but can we just talk about this?”
Jung Jaewoo, who belatedly covered his mouth, looked at Jung Heewon.
Fortunately, instead of listening to Jung Jaewoo, Jung Heewon was scouting the empty second-floor lobby.
Jung Jaewoo, slightly relieved, asked again.
“That person... Is she the Jung Heewon I know? Right?”
"You're right.”
“Omg!”
Jung Heewon, who was far away, looked around this way because he was screaming so loudly.
“What's going on?”
“It's nothing.”
Jung Jaewoo could not calm down easily and gasped for breath. He asked:
“Have you met the other <Kim Dokja’s Company> members by any chance? I saw Lee Jihye as well. Did you see Kim Dokja and Yoo Joonghyuk—”
“Hey, Heewon might be confused, so let’s not talk about this now.”
“Oh, sorry.”
Jung Jaewoo lowered his head with a sullen face and I felt sorry.
<!>[A new die has been created!]
I handed him the die to change the subject.
“Will Jaewoo-ssi throw it this time?”
"Um, is that okay?”
“Yes.”
Jung Jaewoo nodded with a smile.
“More, I’ll throw it!”
Jung Jaewoo shouted vigorously and rolled the die.
<!>[The number on the die is 5.]
<!>[Go up the stairs to the third floor.]
I was expecting a 6, but a 5 wasn't too bad.
With this, the total number of dice rolls is 21.
Are we going to the third floor at once?
I might be lucky to have met Jung Jaewoo here.
<!>[Fell into the 'trap stage'!]
<!>[Go down the stairs by 3 steps.]
Huh?
<!>[Enter the normal stage.]
Didn't [Little Luck] work this time?
“Get ready.”
<!>[You can clear this stage by watching the movie's ending.]
<!>[The difficulty of this stage is high. Upon clearing the stage, a ‘ladder’ is provided.]
<!>[This stage is shared with the first runners.]
In the blink of an eye, a landscape of greenery unfolded.
I thought I knew where this place was.
Looking around, Jung Heewon and Jung Jaewoo seemed to have noticed the general situation.
The cries of giant monsters could be heard from everywhere.
Somehow, it seemed to be the movie that Kim Dokja and his party cleared in “ORV.”
Jung Jaewoo murmured.
“Oh my god. Hey, is this the movie? Tyranno comes out—”
“It seems so.”
If it was really that movie, the difficulty level was high, but I could get quite useful items.
For example, the enhanced ampoule hidden in the central laboratory.
There was just one thing that stuck.
<!>[Share the stage with the starters.]
Obviously, the system messages were taken that way. In other words, it meant that there was a “starter” who entered this stage before us.
Who is it?
Is it Yoo Joonghyuk?
