<title>983 Episode 59 What Ending (4)

<@>[Is that important?]

The moment Mitra asked, sparks erupted in the air again. Then, the voice of dokkaebi Biryu was heard.

<!>[Didn't I tell you before? If you don't, if you don't enter the sanctuary— yo, you'll meet a terrible fate!]

The moment the startled Mitra raised his head, a deafening roar echoed through the battlefield.

<@>[A 'Disaster' descends upon the 'Super-Large Battlefield'!]

With a deafening roar, the nearby terrain began to change.

<@>[The 'World Serpent' appeared upon the 'Super-Large Battlefield'!]

A majestic force descended upon the battlefield.

I observed the descending calamity with calm eyes.

<&>「It was an expected development.」

With a mythical constellation like Mitra active, there was no way a being wouldn't appear to balance it. Just as the 'Apocalypse Dragon', appeared in the 'Battlefield of Myth', I thought it was only natural that a similar disaster would strike here as well.

<@>[No way.]

Mitra glared at me, eyes wide.

He was right. The reason I brought Mitra, with his own agenda, here was because I needed a shield to temporarily block that 'disaster'.

<&>「The 'World Serpent' is one of the major disasters associated with the destruction of 'Ragnarok'."」

There's no way a real 'World Serpent' would appear here. The 'World Serpent' of 'Ragnarok' was the mythical disaster, 'Jormungandr.'

So, the 'World Serpent' summoned here...

<!>[The Black Serpent of the East—]

With Mitra's crushing mantra, the summoned giant snake turned to me.

"I never thought I'd encounter that constellation here."

'Yamata no Orochi'. The constellation that had been the scourge of Peaceland—the 'Eight-Headed Monarch'. It had transformed into a 'disaster' and attacked us.

<@>[The constellation, the 'Eight-Headed Monarch', roars!]

Yamata no Orochi shook its nine heads and unleashed its breath. The constellations in the swept area screamed and scattered.

Oooooooh!

Yamata no Orochi thrust five heads through the disintegrating liquid. Mitra, undeterred, unleashed his power.

<@>[How dare you!]

A spear of light appeared in the air, blasting two of Orochi's heads, but three of its heads successfully bit off Mitra's limbs. At the same time, Mitra's [Light Prison] was released.

"Dokja-ssi!"

Mitra shouted, discovering Jung Heewon and Anna Croft, who had safely escaped the prison.

<!>[No! Could it be...? The Round Table!]

This was our last chance.

Without hesitation, I opened the 'Missing Bush' with the two of us. A pitch-black swirl of darkness began to suck us in.

<@>[Stop!]

Mitra was persistent. As if determined to destroy us if he couldn't have us, Mitra risked even being bitten by Orochi as he hurled his spear of light at us.

I sank into silence as I watched the terrifying spears slashing through the air. I was able to deflect a few with my 'Unbreakable Faith', but blocking them all was impossible.

The moment I decided to protect them with my own body—

<!>[Step back, you wicked foreign power!]

There was someone who had taken Mitra's spear on our behalf. He swung his long bamboo stick, deflecting the incoming spears of light.

I recognized him immediately.

<@>[The constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', protects you!]

He, who lost his incarnation in 'Valhalla Hall', also participated in this 'large-scale battlefield'.

The holy relic of the Great Master Samyeong, which had received Mitra's spear, suddenly lost its power and began to crumble. With a crackling sound, his incarnation body, impaled by the spear, began to spit out a story.

<@>[Go.]

If we leave this to happen, Great Master Samyeong will die.

I reached out, but Great Master Samyeong shook his head and pushed me away. His incarnation body, pierced by the spear and reduced to tatters. Even so, the stars of the Korean Peninsula shone brightly, almost fleetingly. In his final moments, Great Master Samyeong looked at Kim Anna.

<!>[Thank you, my descendants.]

The swirling darkness engulfed me and my companions. Mitra's sorrowful mantra echoed in the distance. And then a bitter cold swept over me. If I hadn't been holding onto Jung Heewon and Anna Croft's wrists, the bitter cold would have made it impossible to even sense their presence.

In a world frozen in time, a sound like the sound of gears clicking could be heard.

The sound of something clicking. Something falling out of alignment. Something breaking. And then the sound of something being realigned.

Following this, a record appeared before my eyes.

<&>「This 'beyond' world is a place where the laws we know don't apply.」

Jung Heewon and Anna Croft looked at me with startled eyes.

"Dokja-ssi."

"Something's strange."

Then a faint light enveloped the surroundings.

Anna Croft's body and the man she carried, Kim Namwoon, were both wrapped up in a storm of probability.

<&>「Why?」

An instinctive alarm bell rang in my head. Why was this 'probability storm' hitting just those two people? And why was it only for those two people?

I couldn't understand why. However, the subsequent record revealed the consequences of the storm.

<&>「The 'world' we're moving into doesn't accept 'Anna Croft' and 'Kim Namwoon'.」

With a terrifying thought, I instinctively shouted at Anna Croft.

"Tear the ticket! Quickly!"

Sparks exploded from her body at the same moment I shouted. Fortunately, she must have torn both tickets in time, as I saw Anna Croft disappear along with Kim Namwoon.

Startled, Jung Heewon spoke.

"Dokja—"

"Hold on tight!"

The surrounding space-time shuddered violently, as if the foreign object had been safely expelled.

<&>「And the story begins.」

Jung Heewon and I felt our bodies melting, and without a moment to resist, we became part of space-time. My vision flickered, and the history of the universe unfolded before my eyes. Countless stars spread out where the first light had once been. The galaxy formed by the stars. The stories that illuminated that galaxy.

<&>「The Star Stream.」

The world of stories I'd read, written, and lived through. As if I were a fluid, I flowed through all those galaxies, heading toward the end of a long history.

<&>「There was a great wall there.」

As I looked at the wall, the wall looked back at me. I felt the great records within the wall respond simultaneously. Records fiercely calling out to me, as if begging for me to choose one from the others.

I chose one.

<&>「A certain ending.」

That was because I felt the emotions of the people I longed to meet so strongly in that record.

The moment I touched the record, I felt a sense of my body being regenerated, and dizziness washed over me. The surroundings brightened, and the record transformed into a landscape.

<&>「There, a blindingly white hospital room unfolded before me.」

My heart pounded.

<&>「Inside that hospital room stood the people he had longed for so much.」

I tried to call their names. But my voice remained silent. It was only natural. My voice was not permitted in this 'hospital room'.

<&>「They are beings we can only meet outside of this narrative.」

I am a reader. A being who reads the characters' stories.

<&>「There was <Kim Dokja Company>.」

Han Sooyoung, Yoo Joonghyuk, Yoo Sangah, Shin Yoosoung, Lee Gilyoung, Jung Heewon, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Seolhwa, Lee Jihye, Jang Hayoung...

The <Kim Dokja Company> I knew.

They were in that hospital room.

<&>「"I'm going to the first portal!"」

It was a hospital room I knew very well.

<&>「"Isn't anyone thinking something strange? If you go to the first one, you'll be able to meet Dokja-ssi again. Right, Biyoo?"」

Jung Heewon's voice. Not the Jung Heewon I knew—it was the Jung Heewon of the 1,864th round, known to Kim Dokja.

<&>「Two portals were before my eyes.」

The moment I saw those portals, I realized what I was seeing.

<&>「"What are you all hesitating for? Aren't you going in? You can meet Dokja-ssi again. The Dokja-ssi we remember is out there."」

I already knew this scene. The 'two portals' left behind by Kim Dokja.

<&>「This scene is the previous unknown ending of 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint'.」

<Kim Dokja Company>, having reached its conclusion, faced two portals.

The first portal was 'the ending where Kim Dokja returns'. And the second portal was 'the ending where Kim Dokja doesn't return'.

And Jung Heewon was saying. We should go to the first ending. Then we could meet Kim Dokja again.

<&>「"I'm not going."」

But someone opposed Jung Heewon's opinion.

<&>「"The first portal is clearly a trap. It's so obvious. Have you already forgotten what happened on the subway?"」

It was Han Sooyoung.

<&>「"It was like this back then. You were tricked by Kim Dokja and brought out a fake."」

Amidst the group's hesitation, Han Sooyoung explained to them why they had to enter the 'second portal'.

<&>「"What if we enter the first portal only to find Kim Dokja, who lacked the same quality as before?"」

A longing to meet the 'Kim Dokja' they longed for again.

<&>「"And I will track down each and every one of the 'Kim Dokja fragments' who imagined that ending and torment them until they come up with a proper 'ending'."」

People who wanted to love even the 'misfortune' imagined by Kim Dokja, who had become their 'Oldest Dream'.

<&>「"I'll catch that guy and bring him back, no matter what. I'm tired of playing with numbers, whether it's 49% or 51%. He has to be 100% now."」

So they chose the second portal and set out to find the scattered 'Kim Dokja fragments'.

<&>「That was the beginning of this whole story.」

I watched the backs of the Kim Dokja Company enter the portal. Han Sooyoung, Yoo Joonghyuk, and Biyoo disappeared beyond the portal. Lee Gilyoung and Lee Jihye also disappeared beyond the portal.

Shin Yoosoung looked back one last time just before disappearing. Without realizing it, I reached out to the child. I wanted to tell her not to go. But I couldn't. Because in this story, I wasn't the author.

As the group made their choices and disappeared, the hospital room door creaked open once again.

<&>「They are the stars who have long loved this story.」

As expected, the constellations I knew were there. With Kim Dokja Company gone, they, too, had come to choose their own ending.

<&>「Just as the lights on the stage go out, the stars have chosen their own endings.」

The characters all departed, and soon, only two portals remained in the hospital room, empty. I sat down and stared blankly at the portal through which they had disappeared. Why did they have to make that choice? Even if it was all a lie, couldn't they imagine a happy ending with their eyes closed?

<&>「This story begins with such a question.」

Slowly, I raised my head, and a sentence began to appear before my eyes.

<&>「What would this story have been like if the group had chosen the 'first portal'?」

I slowly rose from my seat and, as if entranced, walked toward the first portal, still glowing brightly.

<&>「What kind of world lies beyond that portal that Han Sooyoung and her group didn't choose?」

As if waiting, the swirling portal sucked me in.

And so the story began.

<&>「This is the story of that 'house'."」
