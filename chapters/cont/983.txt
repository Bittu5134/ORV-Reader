<title>983 Episode 59 What Kind of Ending (4)
<@>[Is that... important?]
The moment Mitra asked, sparks erupted in the air again. Then, the voice of dokkaebi Biryu cut through the tension.
<!>[Didn't I tell you before? If you don't enter the sanctuary— well, you'll meet a terrible fate!]
Startled, Mitra raised his head just as a deafening roar echoed across the battlefield.
<@>[A 'Disaster' descends upon the 'Super-Large Battlefield'!]
With a sound like the earth tearing apart, the terrain began to twist and buckle.
<@>[The 'World Serpent' has appeared on the 'Super-Large Battlefield'!]
A majestic, crushing pressure descended upon us. I observed the calamity with calm eyes.
<&>「It was an expected development.」
With a mythical constellation like Mitra active, the balance of the scenario demanded a counterforce. Just as the 'Apocalypse Dragon' had appeared in the 'Battlefield of Myths', it was only natural that a similar disaster would strike here.
<@>[Impossible.]
Mitra glared at me, eyes wide with betrayal. He was right to be angry. The reason I had brought him along—despite his obvious agenda—was because I needed a shield to temporarily block this very disaster.
<&>「The 'World Serpent' is one of the key calamities associated with 'Ragnarok'.」
Of course, there was no way the real World Serpent would appear here. The true 'Jormungandr' of Ragnarok was a Myth-grade catastrophe on a cosmic scale.
So, the 'World Serpent' summoned here...
<@>[The Black Serpent of the East—]
As Mitra muttered the name, the summoned giant snake turned its nine heads toward me.
"I never thought I'd encounter that constellation here."
'Yamata no Orochi'. The constellation that had plagued Peaceland—the 'Eight-Headed Sovereign'. It had been twisted into a 'Disaster' and unleashed upon us.
<@>[The constellation, 'Eight-Headed Sovereign', roars!]
Yamata no Orochi shook its massive heads and unleashed a breath of venomous energy. The constellations caught in the blast screamed as their incarnations disintegrated.
Oooooooh!
Orochi thrust five of its heads through the melting terrain. Mitra, undeterred, unleashed his power.
<@>[How dare you!]
A spear of light materialized in the air, blasting two of Orochi's heads into oblivion. However, three other heads successfully clamped onto Mitra's limbs, tearing through his defense. At the same time, his [Prison of Light] shattered.
"Dokja-ssi!"
Mitra shouted, spotting Jung Heewon and Anna Croft, who had escaped the broken prison.
<@>[No! Could it be...? The Round Table!]
This was our last chance. Without hesitation, I grabbed my companions and opened the 'Missing Bush'. A pitch-black swirl of darkness began to suck us in.
<@>[Stop!]
Mitra was persistent. As if determined to destroy us if he couldn't have us, he risked being devoured by Orochi to hurl his spear of light at our retreating forms.
I went cold as I watched the terrifying spears slash through the air. I deflected a few with 'Unbreakable Faith', but blocking them all was impossible.
The moment I prepared to shield them with my own body—
<@>[Step back, you wicked foreign power!]
Someone stepped in front of us, taking Mitra's spear. He swung a long bamboo stick, deflecting the incoming light with a desperate strength.
I recognized him immediately.
<@>[The constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', protects you!]
The Great Master Samyeong, who had lost his incarnation in 'Valhalla Hall', had joined this large-scale battlefield to the end.
The holy relic of the Great Master, having absorbed the impact of a Myth-grade attack, lost its glow and began to crumble. With a crackling sound, his incarnation body, impaled by the spear, began to spill its story.
<@>[Go.]
If we left now, Great Master Samyeong would die. I reached out, but he shook his head and pushed me away. His body was tattered, his existence fading. Yet, the star of the Korean Peninsula shone brightly in his final moments. He looked past me, fixing his gaze on Anna Croft.
<@>[Thank you... my descendant.]
The swirling darkness engulfed us. Mitra's sorrowful roar echoed in the distance, quickly drowned out by a bitter, biting cold. If I hadn't been gripping Jung Heewon and Anna Croft's wrists, the cold would have severed my sense of their existence entirely.
In a world where time seemed frozen, a sound echoed—like gears clicking into place.
Click.
Something fell out of alignment. Something broke. And then, the sound of something being forcibly realigned.
A record appeared before my eyes.
<&>「This 'world beyond' is a place where the laws we know do not apply.」
Jung Heewon and Anna Croft looked at me with startled eyes.
"Dokja-ssi."
"Something is wrong."
A faint light enveloped us. Then, Anna Croft and the unconscious Kim Namwoon were wrapped in a sudden, violent storm of probability.
<&>「Why?」
Alarm bells rang in my head. Why was the storm hitting only those two?
I didn't understand the cause, but the subsequent record revealed the consequence.
<&>「The 'world' we are moving into does not accept 'Anna Croft' or 'Kim Namwoon'.」
Terrified by the implication, I shouted at Anna.
"Tear the tickets! Quickly!"
Sparks exploded from her body the moment I screamed. Fortunately, she must have torn both tickets in time, as I saw her vanish along with Kim Namwoon.
Startled, Jung Heewon cried out.
"Dokja—"
"Hold on tight!"
The surrounding space-time shuddered violently, as if the foreign objects had been safely expelled.
<&>「And the story begins.」
Jung Heewon and I felt our bodies melting. Without a moment to resist, we became part of the stream of space-time. My vision flickered, and the history of the universe unfolded before my eyes. Countless stars spread out where the first light had once been. Galaxies formed, illuminated by the stories that birthed them.
<&>「The Star Stream.」
The world of stories I'd read, written, and lived through. As if I were a fluid, I flowed through all those galaxies, heading toward the end of a long history.
<&>「There was a great wall there.」
As I looked at the wall, the wall looked back at me. I felt the great records within it respond—fiercely calling out, begging me to choose.
I chose one.
<&>「A certain ending.」
I chose it because the emotions of the people I longed to meet were so strong within that record.
The moment I touched it, I felt my body regenerating. Dizziness washed over me as the surroundings brightened, the abstract record transforming into a tangible landscape.
<&>「There, a blindingly white hospital room unfolded before me.」
My heart pounded.
<&>「Inside that room stood the people he had longed for so much.」
I tried to call their names. But my voice remained silent. It was only natural. My voice was not permitted in this 'hospital room'.
<&>「They are beings we can only meet outside of this narrative.」
I am a reader. A being who observes.
<&>「There was <Kim Dokja Company>.」
Han Sooyoung, Yoo Joonghyuk, Yoo Sangah, Shin Yoosoung, Lee Gilyoung, Jung Heewon, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Seolhwa, Lee Jihye, Jang Hayoung...
The <Kim Dokja Company> I knew.
They were in that hospital room.
<&>「"I'm going to the first portal!"」
It was a scene I knew very well.
<&>「"Isn't anyone thinking something strange? If you go to the first one, you'll be able to meet Dokja-ssi again. Right, Biyoo?"」
Jung Heewon's voice. Not the Jung Heewon I knew—but the Jung Heewon of the 1,864th round, the one who remembered Kim Dokja.
<&>「Two portals stood before my eyes.」
The moment I saw them, I realized what I was witnessing.
<&>「"What are you all hesitating for? Aren't you going in? We can meet Dokja-ssi again. The Dokja-ssi we remember is out there."」
I knew this scene. The 'two portals' left behind by the Oldest Dream.
<&>「This scene is the unknown ending of 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint'.」
<Kim Dokja Company>, having reached its conclusion, faced two choices.
The first portal: 'The ending where Kim Dokja returns'.
The second portal: 'The ending where Kim Dokja does not return'.
Jung Heewon was arguing for the first. She believed that if they went there, they could be reunited.
<&>「"I'm not going."」
But someone opposed her.
<&>「"The first portal is clearly a trap. It's so obvious. Have you already forgotten what happened on the subway?"」
It was Han Sooyoung.
<&>「"It was like this back then. You were tricked by Kim Dokja and brought out a fake."」
Amidst the group's hesitation, Han Sooyoung explained why they had to choose the 'second portal'.
<&>「"What if we enter the first portal only to find a Kim Dokja who lacks the same quality as before?"」
They longed to meet the 'Kim Dokja' they remembered.
<&>「"And I will track down each and every one of the 'Kim Dokja fragments' who imagined that ending and torment them until they come up with a proper 'ending'."」
She spoke of the people who wanted to love even the 'misfortune' imagined by the Kim Dokja who had become their 'Oldest Dream'.
<&>「"I'll catch that guy and bring him back, no matter what. I'm tired of playing with numbers, whether it's 49% or 51%. He has to be 100% now."」
So they chose the second portal. They set out to find the scattered fragments of their reader.
<&>「That was the beginning of this whole story.」
I watched the backs of <Kim Dokja Company> as they entered the portal. Han Sooyoung, Yoo Joonghyuk, and Biyoo disappeared. Lee Gilyoung and Lee Jihye followed.
Shin Yoosoung looked back one last time just before vanishing. Without realizing it, I reached out to the child. I wanted to tell her not to go. But I couldn't. In this story, I wasn't the author.
As the group made their choices and disappeared, the hospital room door creaked open once again.
<&>「They are the stars who have long loved this story.」
The constellations I knew were there. With <Kim Dokja Company> gone, they, too, had come to choose their own ending.
<&>「Just as the lights on the stage go out, the stars choose their own finale.」
The characters departed. Soon, only the two portals remained in the empty hospital room. I sat down and stared blankly at the void they had left behind. Why did they have to make that choice? Even if it was all a lie, couldn't they have imagined a happy ending with their eyes closed?
<&>「This story begins with such a question.」
Slowly, I raised my head. A sentence began to appear before my eyes.
<&>「What would this story have been like if the group had chosen the 'first portal'?」
I rose from my seat and, as if entranced, walked toward the first portal, which was still glowing brightly.
<&>「What kind of world lies beyond that portal that Han Sooyoung and her group refused to choose?」
As if waiting, the swirling portal sucked me in.
And so, the story began.
<&>「This is the story of that 'house'.」
