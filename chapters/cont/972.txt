<title>972 Episode 58 Mythical Constellation (4)
I told Jung Heewon that I had discovered the name of Lee Dansu in the 'ranking records'.
Jung Heewon was shocked when she heard about the game, and she looked even more surprised when she heard the news about Dansu ahjussi.
"So he’s still alive? »
"That is very likely."
"What on earth is that 'bush'?"
As I was wondering how to explain it in an easy way, it was Kim Anna-ssi who spoke on behalf of me.
"As you may have seen in the game earlier, the 'bush' is a random event zone that occurs in each game. Basically, it is a place where participants can hide, and special events may occur depending on the characteristics of the bush."
"Ah, so that bush from earlier…"
Anna Croft nodded and responded to Jung Heewon's lament.
"The bush we entered was a 'chaos bush'. It was a bush with an 'observation prevention' effect and a 'probability reduction' effect."
"Then is 'Missing Bush' original?"
"The bush can sometimes be found if special conditions are met, but the probability is very low. Selena Kim tried to find the bush in the previous game, but failed."
I expected it. I also asked 'Selena Kim' to investigate the bush, but I did not expect that the 'missing bush' would actually be found.
"Then what should we do? We have to go into the bushes to find Dansu ahjussi…"
But this time, we have to find the 'missing bush' at all costs.
Fortunately, this time Anna Croft knew the answer.
"The only place where the probability of finding a missing bush is low is in a 'small battlefield'."
The battlefield of the skirmish is divided into small, medium, and large.
Most matches take place in 'small' format, but I heard that sometimes medium or large battlefields occur when several teams form an alliance or a special event occurs.
"When a large battlefield is opened, there is a very high probability of a 'missing bush' occurring."
In other words, in order to find Dansu ahjussi, we had to enter the 'large battlefield' at all costs.
Jung Heewon opened her mouth as if strengthening her will.
"Dokja-ssi, you have already fought the 'preliminary battle'. I will look for him alone."
"No, I can’t let Heewon-ssi participate in the battlefield alone. Me and Kim Anna-ssi will go together."
Kim Anna-ssi, who seemed to have been taken to the battlefield again, looked at me thoughtfully.
However, it was not Kim Anna-ssi who spoke, but Jung Heewon.
"You must not participate in the 'battlefield' anymore. You have already satisfied the conditions for the upper level scenario."
"Even if you meet the conditions, you can still participate in the scenario. Just as other constellations have done—"
"Have you forgotten what you just did?"
Jung Heewon said, looking back towards the noisy 'Valhalla Hall'.
"Do you think those bastards will leave you alone if you enter the battlefield again?"
The wails of the constellations who lost the bet filled the hall.
The stars must have now vaguely predicted how much power I have. When I return to the battlefield, they will also appear prepared accordingly.
But I was also in a situation where I couldn't compromise.
"Heewon-ssi. If Heewon-ssi and I were in opposite positions, do you think you would have let me go to the battlefield alone?"
"That’s…"
"I feel the same way. I have no intention of leaving my colleagues to die alone."
Jung Heewon's expression changed subtly when she heard the word 'colleague'.
<!>[The story, 'Regret, Impoverishment, Obsession', nods.]
She cleared her throat lightly and spoke.
"Okay. If that’s the case, Dokja-ssi. Instead, you must go to the same battlefield. You must stay by my side. Understood?"
"All right."
"I’m going to go out first and look for someone who can join the team. I don’t know if there will be any applicants."
Anna Croft, who had been silent, said while looking at the back of Jung Heewon, who had walked a long way away.
"She cares about you very much."
"Me too."
Anna Croft smiled and asked what I thought.
"I guess she still doesn’t know how evil you are, right?"
"Yes. I cheated well."
"She will soon be greatly disappointed."
"I plan on not getting caught until the end."
Anna Croft asked sarcastically, as if she didn't like my answer.
"Then why I you find out everything about you?"
"You already knew I was a bad guy, right?"
Anna Croft looked at me with strangely agitated eyes. I looked at Anna Croft and said,
"Will you go to the next battlefield with me?"
Actually, my request was ridiculous. It was no different from asking a person who had suffered through the hell of the pre-war to risk their life once again. Still, I had to say it.
"I really need you. Both in the skirmishes and on the main battlefield of 'Ragnarok'."
"You overestimate me. I’m blocked from [Future Sight] now—"
"[Future Sight] isn’t the only ability you have."
Even though people have been criticizing her for not being able to use [Future Sight], Anna Croft was actually an excellent incarnation even without the ability to predict the future. Worst of all, even Yoo Joonghyuk, who hates Anna Croft so much, would have recognized at least one of her abilities.
Anna Croft looked at me with complicated eyes, then answered with a sigh.
"It’s enough to pay lip service. It's not like I have the right to veto in the first place... Is your goal to save your former comrades on the battlefield?"
"That’s right. Are you going together?"
"It is not difficult to go together, but there is one task left to solve before that."
"Yes. That's right."
It's good to form a team, but in order to save Dansu ahjussi, we first had to find a 'large battlefield' that we could participate in.
The problem is that the 'large battlefield' is not a stage that can be easily opened.
Moreover, if 'Valhalla Hall' is in disarray like it is now—
"I have an idea."
Fortunately, this time our brilliant Kim Anna-ssi seemed to have a plan.
***
When we came back to the 'Valhalla Hall', waiting for us were the staff of the 'Golden Dice Hall', including Skuld. Behind them, who bowed their heads as if in regret, was Mitra, the owner of December 25th and the chairman of 'Valhalla Hall'. Mitra seemed to have succeeded in recovering his incarnation body in the meantime.
"See you again."
Mitra's complexion looked even more gaunt than before. That's probably why he used excessive probability to ask for my help.
"Why did you disappear earlier? Did the Round Table call you?"
Mitra asked back, twitching his eyebrows, as if he hadn't expected to be asked so openly.
<!>[Do you know about the round table?]
"I don’t know, but I’ve heard rumors."
It's not clear because it was a scene that passed like a hazy dream, but the moment I ascended to 'myth-grade', I caught a glimpse of the image of the 'round table' where the mythological constellations were sitting.
Actually, looking back now, I'm not sure if it's appropriate to call it a round table.
A frighteningly black, elongated, oval round table. In a sense, the round table seemed like a universe. A huge universe that expands endlessly.
<@>[Be careful. Because they are the ones who will do anything to create the playground they want.]
"So aren’t you also a mythical constellation?"
<!>[People like me are no longer treated as 'myths'.]
"May I ask what happened?"
<!>[You know the situation roughly, right?]
As expected, it seemed that the reason Mitra was in this state was because of the fight with 'Snowfield Kim Dokja'.
He continued speaking with a bitter look on his face.
<!>[Every myth has an obligation to give way to a newly born myth. There are only two options for myths being pushed out. Do you fiercely burn all your stories and disappear, or do you rely on a new myth and live like a parasite?]
"What choice did you make?"
<@>[Have you considered my suggestion?]
Perhaps that was Mitra's answer. He still hasn't given up on his story. He dreams of the day when he will once again ascend to the sky of the great story and seek revenge.
"You said you would be on my side if I helped you."
<!>[I promise with all my stories.]
"Tell me exactly what you want."
<!>[Please do not collect the bet money from the last bet.]
"Do you mean to dismiss the bet as never happened?"
<@>[I don’t mean that. Then your story will also lose its power. We do not want you to receive D-coins.]
It was a pretty explicit request, so I tried saying this as a test.
"What if I refuse?"
<!>[The constellation, 'Lord of December 25th', is looking at you.]
“Are you going to fight me?"
Mitra stared at me with calm eyes and then shook his head.
<!>[I don’t think so. Your victory was justified. I won't hold any grudges if you refuse.]
That level of assurance was not enough.
I opened my mouth again as if to provoke.
"I have fought against your constellations from <Veda> several times. I have also killed your narrative-grade constellations 'Thunder-Eater' and 'General of Vanara'. And yet you are saying that you will not hold any grudges? Are you sincere?"
<!>[I will guarantee it on the honor of <Veda>.]
Mitra was sincere. He truly testified to me on behalf of the reputation of 'Valhalla Hall'. Then it was time for me to choose too.
"Unfortunately, we cannot give up the entire bet."
<@>[Then?]
"Let’s put it in debt."
<@>[Debt?]
"You must be afraid that all the constellations that lost 'D-Coins' will be summoned to the 'main battlefield' and the entire ecology of 'Valhalla Hall' will collapse. Isn’t that right?"
Mitra's silence was an affirmation.
I continued to say.
"So, what if I lend D-coins to the constellations? I lend the betting money I win to the constellations without interest."
Did he not know that I would make such a suggestion? Mitra listened to my story with a somewhat strange look on his face.
"If there are relics or stories belonging to the constellations, I can appraise them myself and cancel the debt accordingly."
<!>[Are you planning to open a pawn shop against the constellations?]
"It’s similar."
Mitra laughed as if he was dumbfounded. In fact, what I am trying to do now is what the 'Golden Dice Hall' has been doing all along.
"If they return the lost bets in the form of debt, they won't be paid right away anyway."
Settlement. It was a special system that existed inside 'Valhalla Hall'.
<&>「All constellations residing in 'Valhalla Hall' must pay a 'settlement fee'.」
A housing fee that must be paid by constellations who repeat 'preliminary battles' indefinitely without participating in the 'main battlefield'.
Even now, the constellations that failed to pay the settlement fee for 'Valhalla Hall' were being dragged to the 'main battlefield' in real time.
Mitra, who had been listening to the story in silence, asked back in a skeptical tone.
<@>[It may take a very long time for the debt to be repaid. Plus, there are a lot of malicious stars here. You could just open your eyes and have your coins stolen, but are you still going to just lend them your coins?]
"I didn’t say I would just lend it to them."
<@>[Then?]
"There are conditions."
And from now on, this was the main point of our search for Mitra.
The brilliant Kim Anna-ssi said this.
<&>「"There is only one thing, there is a being who can directly open the 'large battlefield' in this 'Valhalla Hall'."」
A star that can open the 'large battlefield' we need at will.
"Please open a large battlefield."
The owner of 'Valhalla Hall'—Mitra could exercise such authority.
Mitra opened his eyes wide and said, wondering what he was thinking about my suggestion.
<!>[Why are you asking for that? Are you really planning to participate in a large-scale battlefield?]
"I guess so."
<!>[Your spirit is truly amazing. If a large battlefield opens, all the constellations here will be targeting you. If you lend D-coins to the constellations, the situation will get worse.]
If I die, there will be no need to repay their debt, so of course more constellations will target me and participate in the 'large battlefield'. That much was already expected.
"It doesn’t matter. That will open up another good bet."
Mitra looked at me curiously and then nodded.
<@>[I will accept your offer. From now on, the 'Golden Dice Hall' will owe you 10 million D-coins. And in return for this contract, you will receive the right to participate in the newly opened 'large battlefield'.]
Mitra raised his hand in the air and began to manifest his power. The entire 'Valhalla Hall' trembled, creating a huge quagmire in the center of the stadium.
The power of creation. A battlefield was being born in a swirling swamp, like churning a huge soup. Under the dazzling twinkling starlight, dirt was spread, and living things began to be born one by one on top of it.
The moment when a universe appears in the hall in the form of a battlefield—
Tuduk.
There was a sound as if something was being twisted far away.
<!>[The constellation, 'Lord of December 25th', looks embarrassed.]
Only I and Mitra heard it. It felt like time and space were creaking and tangling.
<!>[No.]
With Mitra's mutterings, a fierce storm broke out in the dark sky of 'Valhalla Hall'. Stories from the storm were flowing into the stadium.
No, that wasn't just a story.
<&>「Record.」
The chunks of records that moved [Fate] were pouring down like rain, changing the shape of the battlefield.
<&>「So the final battlefield of the prelude will be born there.」
The land created by Mitra instantly became a ruin of death, and the clear sky was covered with dark clouds.
<&>「The cowardly stars who avoided war will finally be held accountable.」
<!>[Fate occurred even while ignoring the power of Mitra, a 'mythical constellation'.]
Even without Mitra telling me, I knew whose work it was.
<&>「The 'Round Table' intervened.」
