<title>675 Episode 21 Kim Dokja (11)
Sparks flew out and the screen was torn lengthwise.
<!>[A fatal error has occurred in the Beginning Theater!]
Beyond the torn screen, the darkness of space shimmered pitch black.
A portal that leads to nowhere.
I looked back at the audience one last time. I saw rlaehrwk37 standing up and looking at me.
The Kim Dokja that was the first to support me.
Lee Dansu ahjussi’s daughter, Noh Jiyoon.
"I’ll definitely come back to get you."
Leaving behind Asmodeus' shout, I jumped into the torn screen with Yoo Joonghyuk.
<!>[An error occurred temporarily in the 'scenario'!]
It felt like time and space were swirling and my body was disintegrating into cells.
Nevertheless, I did not let go of my grip on Yoo Joonghyuk.
I thought it was funny.
Yoo Joonghyuk from the 41st round and 49% Kim Dokja. Is there another worst combination like this?
"Don’t die, you bastard."
Once again, my vision fluctuated and I felt like my body was being thrown somewhere.
The transfer was complete. I hit the floor, swallowing the pain that felt like every bone in my body was breaking.
"Yoo Joonghyuk."
Yoo Joonghyuk still said nothing.
Is it because something happened to this guy and he still can't wake up?
"Haven’t you been passed out for too long?"
I managed to catch my breath and looked around. It was good that I escaped from the theater safely. But...
Why did I come to a place like this even though I was away?
A chill slowly seeped into my entire body. Even my breath seemed to freeze. No matter where I look, all I see is pitch black emptiness.
<!>[The area is not a scenario area.]
A world where no stars shine on us. Through the darkness of the universe swallowed up by the distant void, I felt unknown gods looking down on us.
I lifted my head to look up at the sky, mocking our fate that cannot be recorded anywhere.
I saw it all.
<!>[You have been kicked out of the scenario.]
It was like that.
We fell into the 'Great Hall'.
Someone was calling me in the darkness.
<!>[Scenario departure penalty begins.]

Han Sooyoung sighed in disgust and looked at her whole body. It was hard to breathe, as if her hand was full of hot water. Blood was constantly leaking from her punctured abdomen, and her left optic nerve was damaged, limiting her vision. Her right shoulder was completely shattered and unusable, and her kneecap was deeply wounded.
It was a wonder that her heart was still beating.
When was the last time she suffered such a serious injury?
She thought that was probably the case in the  1865th round.
When she was hunting the iron-blooded dragon with Yoo Joonghyuk and was waiting for Lee Seolhwa to arrive, exhausted.
<&>「"It’s a little unfair."」
When she raised her head, it seemed like she could see the night sky that day. Lying side by side on the tail of the dead dragon, Yoo Joonghyuk spoke in his usual unlucky voice.
<&>「"I should have said I would give the item to you."」
<&>「"That’s not what I’m talking about."」
Han Soo-young sighed lightly and added her words.
<&>「"I was wondering who would know that we fought here like this."」
After saying that, Han Sooyoung regretted it. Because she was complaining, which was not like her. Han Sooyoung quickly shook her head and opened her mouth.
<&>「"What's the use of telling you this-"」
<&>「"Is that why you were writing a novel?"」
Han Sooyoung was surprised by Yoo Joonghyuk’s calm question.
She knows that she is secretly leaving her records everywhere except to Kim Dokja.
She never spoke.
But it seems like Yoo Joonghyuk already knew .
<&>「"I can’t write everything down."」
The record of 1,865 rounds was incomplete.
She was losing her memories while using [Avatar] in real time, and her colleagues were not in a different situation.
In order to clear the scenario with minimal sacrifice, her companions fought with all their might, and in return, they each lost their stories.
Constant repetition of recording and disappearance.
<&>「"There is no need to record everything."」
The words of a man who remembered more and forgot more than anyone else. Han Sooyoung spoke as if she was resisting.
<&>「"Still, some very important things."」
<&>「"When I repeat regression, I often forget my memories."」
These were the words of Yoo Joonghyuk, who rarely talks about himself. Han Sooyoung listened to him without even realizing it.
<&>「"But memories from previous rounds are not always helpful."」
Han Sooyoung understood what that meant.
She must have many memories that she would like to forget, as she has repeatedly returned over the years.
Some memories would have tortured his emotions, while others would have interfered with his objective judgment.
<&>「"I don’t remember anything. There were times when I found a better way."」
One day, Han Sooyoung may have decided to forget a disturbing memory. In order to clear the scenario, she did not even know how precious that memory was to her.
<&>「"Don’t you want to regain your lost memories?"」
In response to Han Sooyoung’s question, Yoo Joonghyuk thought for a moment and then said.
<&>「"Just because the memory has disappeared, it does not mean that the place where the memory was located has disappeared. And there is a guy who has a better memory than me."」
There was no need to ask who it was.
<&>「"Weren’t you writing the story for him?"」
<&>「"That's right."」
<&>「"Do you think he’s going to blame you for not writing everything?"」
Han Sooyoung could not answer at that time. The answer that she couldn't give back then has now been given to Han Sooyoung.
"If it’s Kim Dokja."
Han Sooyoung thought about Kim Dokja.
Kim Dokja loves stories more than anyone else in the world.
If it were that guy, he would be focusing on the plot that she didn't write about in one way or another.
He will be able to reason between events and discuss the network of meaning on his own.
One day, he might argue with her.
Kim Dokja, who had been complaining for a long time, asking why she wrote it like this and wondering if it was plagiarism from the previous 'Ways of Survival', will finally read the story that she did not write.
He will finally fill in her own sentences, a story better than the words she had to write.
<!>[The constellation 'Lotus Flower Blooming Under the Moonlight' says it would be better to stop coming in.]
<!>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer' is worried about you.]
Han Sooyoung slowly raised her body.
She can't fight anymore with this body.
She knew instinctively, the damage was too serious. Not only was it impossible to proceed with a normal scenario, but complete recovery was also impossible without long-term treatment.
So, it was at this point that she left this world. Her foolish obsession is to quit and go back the way she came with her companions.
Finding a way to go back to the first portal prepared by Kim Dokja is also difficult.
It'll be fine.
Tsutsutsu-
A light spark flew as she put her hand in her pocket. When she took out her hand, she was holding a lemon candy that Kim Dokja had given her.
Han Sooyoung looked down at the candy, opened her wrapper, and put the candy in her mouth.
The moment she felt the sweet scent of lemon filling her mouth, Han Sooyoung suddenly understood why Kim Dokja had come to this world.
She understood why this world should exist.
<&>「"There were times when I couldn’t remember something and found a better way in the next round."」
At the same time, she also realized why she had to come to this world.
Han Sooyoung looked up at the night sky.
Swirling Great Hall.
Her star didn't really look like they had disappeared somewhere, but she could imagine her own star.
She felt the star's gaze.
Han Sooyoung thought about the last sentence she would write.
***
How on earth can we return to the original scenario?
No matter how much I thought about it, I couldn't think of a way.
Probably the reason why Yoo Joonghyuk and I ended up here is because of Representative Kim Dokja.
It must be revenge.
The problem is that because of this, we could both end up dead.
A chill overtook my entire body. Cold sweat kept running down my spine.
My heart was pounding like it was going to explode.
Tsutsutsutsu-
A feeling of fear as if my existence would disappear at any moment. All I could do was close my lips and hold my breath.
<!>[You are currently outside the scenario area.]
<!>[Your body is currently in a very critical state.]
I knew very well what this was foreshadowing. It was like this when Kim Dokja was first thrown into the demon world.
—Damn! Butter for just 10, no, 15 minutes. Got it?
Is it a miracle?
Bihyung’s voice echoed distantly from somewhere.
—I'll connect the channel somehow and summon you again, so just wait...
But the voice quickly stopped and the cold came again.
I looked back at Yoo Joonghyuk in a spasm of consciousness.
I'm like this too, but what about Yoo Joonghyuk?
<!>[The 'Tales of the Other World' protects this incarnation.]
Should I say it's a blessing among misfortunes?
Yoo Joonghyuk, who is about to ascend to the absolute throne, is temporarily connected to the 'Divine God of the Other World'.
It was in a state of being done.
In other words, the 'Divine God of the Other World, which was connected to him, was also bearing the penalty for leaving the scenario.
How many minutes passed like that?
<!>[A temporary channel has been created.]
I heard a short message in my head.
Has Bihyung returned?
A picture of hope sprang to life in my head.
All I have to do is somehow receive a sub-scenario. If I only receive the scenario, I can prevent the collapse of my existence, just as Kim Dokja maintained the legend in the demon world.
<!>[The constellations of the Nebula <Asgard> are looking at you.]
...Asgard?
<!>[The Nebula <Asgard> says they will provide you with a sub-scenario if you join as an incarnation under Asgard.]
I dreamed of sudden luck.
<!>[If you accept this offer, you will not be able to refuse 'Asgard’s' orders for the next 200 years.]
I opened my mouth in a daze, even forgetting to close it.
There wasn't even one suggestion.
<!>[The constellations of the Nebula <Olympus> are looking at you.]
<!>[The constellations of the Nebula <Olympus> will help if you become an incarnation of Olympus.]
<!>[If you accept this offer, you will become the slave incarnation of the Nebula 'Olympus' for the next 50 years.]
I laughed out loud.
I felt like I finally understood Kim Dokja's anger towards the Nebulae.
"I refuse."
In my arrogance of having read all of this story, I had momentarily forgotten what the constellations were.
These were the constellations.
A tribe that exploits the lives of incarnations for their own pleasure, regardless of means or purpose.
<!>[The constellations of the Nebula <Asgard> are ashamed of your refusal.]
<!>[The constellations of the Nebula <Olympus> sigh at your foolishness.]
Is it a penalty for rejecting the offer?
Suddenly, the chill that I felt throughout my body became even stronger.
I activated [Incite] while tightly hugging my trembling shoulders.
Somehow.
All I have to do is hold out until Bihyung returns.
"I am Kim Dokja…"
Is it because of the wildly bouncing sparks? [Incite] did not activate properly.
Instead, Kim Dokja's memories came to mind in the movements of my closed eyes.
<&>「"Two years is longer than amortization."」
I couldn't tell when that memory was from.
Memories that do not exist in ORV.
Someone said in my memory.
<&>「"In a little while, I will spend more time with you than with the Kim Dokja I know.」
I guess I’ll lose."」
I looked around, gnawing away at that memory.
<&>「"If the real 'me' returns, what happens to 'me' now?"」
In my memories, I was both happy and unhappy.
<&>「"Just because another I exist does not mean that 'I' disappear."」
<&>「"You can believe that there are 1,864 more of those bastards!"」
The reason I am happy is because it was Kim Dokja, and the reason I am unhappy is because it was Kim Dokja.
I muttered as I held my hand toward the blurry memories.
"I am..."
It was then that someone shook my shoulder.
Little by little, warmth spread throughout my body, and the cold that surrounded me gradually subsided. The memories that had swirled like a fierce snowstorm calmed down.
When I opened my eyes, someone was looking at me.
"Are you okay?"
I looked up at her blankly.
Is it a dream? I shook my head several times, but it wasn't a dream.
The story was being told through a small hand holding my shoulder. The warm and gentle sentences written by someone who loves this world were being conveyed to me in their entirety.
"Han Sooyoung."
Han Sooyoung looked at me blankly.
"You..."
Just as I read her story, she also read mine.
She muttered for a while and then opened her mouth.
"…Kim Dokja?"
I understood the faint anticipation and despair contained in that question. So my answer was decided.
"It’s been a while, Han Sooyoung."
