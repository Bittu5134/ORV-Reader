<title>566 Episode 3. Protagonist(?) (3)
As I watched the men approaching with a fearsome momentum, I suddenly realized that I was in Omniscient Reader.
This is 'Geumho Station', where a series of horrific murders have taken place.
The men with the pipes were most likely members of the 'Cheoldoo Group', the mainstream group at Geumho Station.
In a fortunate twist of fate, the original owner of Geumho Station was the character I possesed, Cheon Inho.
In other words, Cheon Inho became the owner of Geumho Station after he defeated all of those terrifying men from the Cheoldoo Group.
How the hell did you do it, Cheon Inho?
In the distance, I could see the men checking our area freeze in their tracks, because there was blood everywhere.
I quickly asked Dansoo ahjussi.
"Ahjussi, did you get a stigma?"
There are two main types of techniques in Omniscient Reader.
One is the 'skill' that the incarnation learns themselves.
The other is the 'stigma', which are powers bestowed by their constellation.
"Uh...... I don't think I can use it yet......."
<!>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' is using a ploy that does not readily lend the stigma to make the incarnation strong.......]
It was my fault for expecting something.
When I looked up, I saw the figure of Bihyung, who was hurriedly sweet-talking the constellations.
<@>[Oh my. How did this person end up on my channel.......]
<!>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is picking his ears as if it's a nuisance.]
<@>[By the way, if you do something like that, the other constellations will.......]
This was the first meeting between the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal and Bihyung.
I decided to try to win Bihyung, because if I was going to make it through the scenario ahead, cunning cooperation with that crazed monster was essential.
'Dokkaebi communication.'
<!>[Activating the 'dokkaebi communication'.]
'Bihyung. I have something to tell you.'
Fortunately, Bihyung accepted the dokkaebi communication.
—What is it? How did you know how to connect the dokkaebi communication?
You forced me to use it when you caught the bug earlier.
I said, hiding my true intentions.
'I want to make a deal with you.'
Bihyung narrowed his eyes as if he were dumbfounded by my out-of-the-blue proposal.
—A deal?
'Yes. A deal.'
Bihyung was speechless for a moment. How many more seconds passed like that?
—Cocky bastard, you're lucky I didn't blow your brains out right now.
He had a hint of amusement in his voice. I answered casually.
'If you do that, you'll lose all the subscribers of your channel, and I think you've already lost a few.'
—What. What?
Bihyung won't be able to kill me now, because I've gradually gotten some constellations interested in me.
I took the risk of attracting the attention of the constellations to take advantage of this.
'Hear what I have to say first, what I'd like to propose is.......'
—Do you also want a 'stream contract'?
I paused, then asked back.
'What are you talking about?'
—Hmm? I guess you don't. I've got a couple of kids who keep asking me for that, saying they were going to make me the Dokkaebi King or something.
Suddenly, I felt a headache.
It was obvious who the requesters were.
'So what did you do?'
—Naturally, I refused. There were a lot of strange children, suddenly showing themselves catching ichthyosaurs, asking me to open the Dokkaebi Bag...... They think they're my friends.
Oh, dear readers.
'Why didn't you do it?'
—Do you think I'm crazy?
If this was the original story, and there was only one otherworldly reader, we wouldn't have this problem.
Kim Dokja was the only reader, and his every action was bound to attract the attention of Bihyung.
But not anymore.
Besides Dansoo ahjussi, there will be other people who cleared the scenario before the 'bug' maneuver is blocked, and there will be other readers who will try to use the same hidden pieces that Kim Dokja used.
Too many readers start doing the same thing, so Bihyung has become wary of them.
......What on earth happened to the real Kim Dokja?
I sighed and opened my mouth.
'Actually, I was going to ask you to sign a stream contract.'
—I'm leaving.
'I'll give you a 7:3 ratio. That's the industry's default settlement ratio.'
I didn't hear the communication go off, which meant that Bihyung was still listening to me.
I poured out my cards one after another.
'I know that a contract between an incarnation and a streamer dokkaebi is not against the rules, and I'll do my best not to let anyone find out.'
'Throughout the contract period, I will not cooperate with other dokkaebi channels without your permission, and I will refrain from any personal behavior that might offend the constellations.'
'During the contract period, until my death, I will not accept any sponsor contracts.'
If this was a publishing contract, I would never have done this.
But now I had no choice.
I have to live.
Bihyung, who was listening to me, asked.
—You, what do you know?
'I know a few things.'
—The other guys wanted me to do it for 10:0 ratio, and I'd only get the commission.
'They must not know much about the industry. It's a tough job, being a babysitter. Reacting to the Executive Branch dokkaebis, collecting the back coins when there's a probability request, and how much jealousy there is among the low-level dokkaebi.'
—You...... Are you a dokkaebi?
'I know your industry well.'
Ji Eunyoo used to say similar things when she was complaining about management.
—I-I won't sign a <Stream Constract> with you. How can I trust a guy who's barely cleared the first scenario.......
I wondered if it was an illusion, but Bihyung's voice was a bit more gentle. It's time to push in.
'But I cleared it in an pretty unique way.'
—It was just luck.
'The sub scenario will start soon, so you can keep an eye on it this time as well.'
—You..... How do you know that? Are you a reincarnator?
Come to think of it, there were reincarnators in Omniscient Reader. I wrote it, but it's a convenient setting.
I shrugged it off.
'Something like that. Anyway, open the sub scenario. It seems like people is coming just in time.'
The pipe men, who had been watching for a while, decided to come up to this side as if they had decided it was worth it.
<!>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' is amused.]
<!>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' is telling 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' to watch because something funny will happen.]
Bihyung, who had overruled the constellation's rebellion, began to prepare a scenario.
—First of all, I'll see how you do it.
'I won't be waiting too long. Honestly, you're not the only dokkaebi.'
The tendons in Bihyung's head twitched, but I couldn't be bothered to pay attention to him now.
"Hey, you over there."
The pipe men were just around the corner. By the looks of them, these guys are no slouches.
"What?"
"What? Look at this."
In response, a man who looked like the leader stepped forward.
This...... I think I know who he is.
I immediately used [Character List].
+

+
Wow, it's really Bang Cheolsoo.
Who is Bang Cheolsoo...... Anyway, he's the guy who gets beaten to death by Kim Dokja at Geumho Station.
His stats seem to be lower than when Kim Dokja first met him.
<!>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' is getting excited.]
<!>[The second scenario has arrived!]
"Hyung-nim. Did you get a message?"
"Ah, it looks like a similar message to the one from earlier."
The men from the Cheoldoo Group, still unfamiliar with the scenario, hesitated.
I checked the scenario.
+

+
This is what happened here.
Originally, Kim Dokja was also performing the sub scenario 'Escape' at this time, so it's not strange.
Is this what Cheon Inho was doing?
Bang Cheolsoo sneered and said.
"It's going to be easy this time, take care of the two guys in front."
The shielding of the area had finally been lifted, and in the distance, I could see people snooping around this way.
"Everybody move. Walk carefully."
Blood spattered on the aprons of the approaching men. Presumably, these guys killed everyone and survived the first scenario.
Dansoo ahjussi got tense next to me. He's a reliable ahjussi, not running away even at times like this.
But this time, it was enough with me alone.
No, I have to do this alone.
"Mate?"
"Leave it to me."
The scenario is still very much up in the air.
Even if I didn't necessarily have a good constellation, I wasn't completely out of the fight.
Especially if, like me, you had a lot of support in the first scenario.
<!>[2,700 coins have been invested into 'strength'.]
<!>[Strength Lv.1 → Strength Lv.10]
<!>[Your strength level has increased dramatically!]
I expected it, but I was still surprised.
My stats were really level 1.
<!>[900 coins have been invested into 'physique'.]
<!>[Physique Lv.1 → Physique Lv.4]
This was also level 1.
Cheon Inho, how the hell did you become the leader of Geumho Station?
<!>[900 coins have been invested into 'agility'.]
<!>[Agility Lv.1 → Agility Lv.4]
Still, this will work for now.
I left aside some coins just in case.
<!>[Coins Possessed: 2,900 C]
In the meantime, a small fry leapt forward swinging his pipe at me.
"Look out, asshole!"
I couldn't spread more my narrow eyes.
I caught the flying pipe with my hand. There was a little pain in my grip, but I managed to snatch the man's pipe away without much difficulty.
"Huh?"
As I watched the panicked man blink stupidly, I gripped the pipe with both hands. The feel of the hard pipe was vivid against my palms.
Normally, I wouldn't have been able to do it, but for Lee Hakhyun now...... No, for Cheon Inho it was no problem.
Kutututuk!
The man's eyes widened as he watched the pipe magically break.
"T-this strength?"
The stat level in 'Omniscient Reader' increases dramatically in units of 10.
This is the power of Strength Lv.10.
I casually tossed the bent pipe to the ground and walked forward.
The panicked Cheoldoo group stumbled backwards.
"Moderation, Bang Cheolsoo."
Bang Cheolsoo's eyes widened in surprise.
"How—"
"It doesn't matter how I know your name."
I said, lightly skimming over the bloodied station.
"The only survivors of this section are me and that man. It's not like we're a bunch of guys with pipes. You know what that means, and you still attack us?"
"T-that—"
"Are you really stupid, or are you pretending to be stupid?"
My strength was at level 10, and my physique and agility were barely above rock bottom. If there was a real group fight, I'd have to spend extra coins.
Biting his lip, Bang Cheolsoo glared at me.
"I see there's a part of you that trusts me, and I'll make sure you know you've met the right man today."
Again, it didn't go over so simply. After all, he had to save face in front of his subordinates.
<!>[The character 'Bang Cheolsoo' has used 'Bluff Lv.2'!]
<!>[Your confidence plummets due to the effect of 'Bluff'.]
Being glared at with such a fearsome face, my heart was pounding. I realized that [Bluff] was a great skill. I would have been fine I had a [Fourth Wall] like Kim Dokja, but I didn't.
Of course, that didn't mean I didn't have the means to fight back.
I faced Bang Cheolsoo, hiding my trembling heart.
<!>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.2' has been activated!]
There was many different ways to use [Incite], Cheon Inho's exclusive skill. The basic ability, of course, is to literally impulse others with words.
However,
<!>[Select a target to incite.]
What if the target weren't 'others'?
<&>「I am Yoo Joonghyuk.」
I will incite myself from now on.
