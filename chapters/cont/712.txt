<title>712 Episode 26 Star Ladder (8)
The sky was changing in real time. It was pitch black, then white, then there was thunder, then rain.
On the other side of an unpredictable weather event, beyond the swaying void curtain, supreme beings were shaking the universe.
What on earth is going on over there?
Has Yoo Joonghyuk really appeared and is grabbing the constellations and stomping them?
—Oh, youngest. There's a piece of story of quality falling over there.
41st round Yoo Joonghyuk’s head hung on my shoulder.
I couldn't figure out what was really going on.
If the being over there is really Yoo Joonghyuk, why didn't he appear here in the form of a possessed person like Shin Yoosoung? Just as Shin Yoosoung used herself in the 41st round, he could also use himself in the 41st round.
—That’s bullshit. If that kid comes here, he'll be in big trouble.
'Why? If Yoo Joonghyuk comes, we can wipe them all out, right?'
—Why do you think Yoo Joonghyuk will help us?
For a moment, I felt a tingling sensation in the back of my head. As I was only thinking about Shin Yoosoung's case, I forgot for a moment what the original purpose of <Kim Dokja Company> was.
According to Han Sooyoung’s memories, the purpose of <Kim Dokja Company> is to retrieve Kim Dokja.
Maybe my presence was a distraction to them.
—It would be nice if the Earth didn't explode like this.
'No, but still...'
I always think about it, but Kim Dokja's impression of Yoo Joonghyuk was a bit crooked. How could Yoo Joonghyuk have even done something like that?
Still, it was true that I was worried at the same time.
If, like Han Sooyoung, Yoo Joonghyuk also tries to get Kim Dokja back in the form of 'quickly destroying this world'...
—But shouldn’t you run fast?
Right. Now is not the time to leisurely think about such things.
Because even now, the incarnations of the giant nebulae were chasing me in real time.
"Tear off his legs!"
"Tear him limb from limb!"
Why on earth are they running and saying things like that?
Anyway, I just think that I should never get caught. But I quickly ran out of breath.
—You need to do some exercise.
'It's refreshing to hear something like that from someone who was
born weak.'
—You can’t do that. Let's borrow it one more time.
<!>[Stage 3 of 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is strongly activated!]
I seemed to feel a stronger overlap with Kim Dokja, and [Way of the Wind] wrapped around my toes, covering over a hundred meters in an instant.
In reality, if I had competed in the Olympics, I would have set a new record right away, but right now, even this wasn't enough.
<!>[The character 'Alexander Mihailidis' activates the exclusive skill 'High-Speed Driving Lv.6'!]
<!>[The character 'Leila Al Hasan' activates the exclusive skill 'Runaway Lv.8'!]
These guys are really persistent.
‘Constellation-nim! Back! Back!'
A dizzying sensation felt in the back of the head. As Kim Dokja reflexively twisted his head, a breathtaking beam of light passed by his earlobe.
Arrow? Or a spear?
Anyway, if I had been a little late, I would have had a hole in the back of my head.
'Left!'
The moment he urgently changed direction, an arrow aimed at a blind spot hit his thigh. Fortunately, it was not me who was hit, but Kim Dokja.
—You said it’s on the left? It came from the right!
'It looks like it came from the right too!'
Kim D okja pulled out the arrow and fired the broken arrow behind him.
The sound of an arrow loaded with [Way of the Wind] piercing something was heard, and a scream rang out.
But neither Kim Dokja nor I looked back.
—Youngest. That.
I checked the ladder hanging in the sky.
'Star Ladder.'
It was the road leading to the 'eighth scenario' that I checked as soon as I arrived in the eastern Washington area.
'You said I shouldn't use that?'
—No way, surviving is the priority now.
'How do you use it?'
Instead of answering, Kim Dokja raised his right hand with all his might and shouted.
"I call the Star Ladder!"
It's simple, I think.
<!>['Star Ladder' does not respond to you.]
Damn it, then that's right.
There is no way the scenario with Kim Dokja would be that smooth.
What was absurd was that, except for us, all other incarnations were moving on to the next scenario through the 'star ladder'.
"Jump out! If you get caught up in here, you’ll die!"
"I will call the Star Ladder!"
The incarnations ran away to the next scenario through the 'star ladder' amidst a proliferation of giant nebulae.
Although the shape, size, and degree of damage to each ladder were different, the ladders came down to everyone except us.
'Why can't we just come down the ladder?'
Perhaps Kim Dokja was in the midst of looking into it, too, when he faintly heard a message from a conversation with Bihyung in his head.
—Constellation. So now... with authority...
authority?
<!>[The constellations with permission to use the 'Star Ladder' are not responding to you.]
<!>[The right to use the 'Star Ladder' is limited to some constellations that contributed to the creation of the 'Recycling Center'.]
I don't know exactly what you're talking about, but anyway, it seems impossible for anyone to lower the ladder.
<!>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' frowns, wondering what the hell that means.]
<!>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' asks what the 'Recycling Center' is.]
<!>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is complaining that the 'Star Stream’s System' seems to have become more difficult these days.]
I'm glad I'm not the only one who's stupid.
I asked Kim Dokja without any expectations.
'Constellation-nim. Don't you have ladder permission?'
—Are you sure?
'Do you have a friend I could ask for?'
—Are you sure?
'So what happens now?'
—Just wait a moment.
'They all came after me?'
Before I knew it, the incarnations were forming a circle and narrowing the siege.
Incarnations of <Olympus>, <Ghost>, <Guardian Tree>, and <Veda>.
"We've caught him! Surround him slowly!"
Judging from what it felt like, there were no people with narrative-grade sponsors.
They are all incarnations of great-grade constellations.
These were all guys who had raised their synchronization rate to the limit.
This scenario is subject to the rules of 'probability'. However, if the number of constellations that raised the synchronization rate to the limit increased, it was normal for the scale to naturally fall out of balance.
'If this is the case, shouldn't someone come help us?'
Yoo Joonghyuk, or even another member <Kim Dokja Company> since Kim Dokja said no for Yoo Joonghyuk earlier.
At least one person can come.
—Do you think a hundred bugs weigh the same as a lion?
I realized how great <Kim Dokja Company> had become.
What a bug. Still, those guys are also constellations of their own.
—Giant nebulae aren't stupid either. It's all calculated based on probability. The proof is that there are so many incarnations, but they don't have any narrative-grade sponsor.
Does that mean they are also adjusting the probability in their own way?
I sighed lightly and counted their numbers. Even at first glance, their number is well over thirty.
On the other hand, this side was now at its limit.
My body, strengthened with 'Dragon Heart', was reduced to rags as soon as it was used with the power of Cheok Jungyeong, and [Bookmark]’s time limit was exhausted.
If that Thebes were to stab me with the tip of a spear, my body would collapse. Now the only one I can trust is Kim Dokja.
—Youngest.
'Yes.'
—Earn some time and say something.
'Yes?'
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' Lv.3 is deactivated.]
It was absurd.
No, if you leave it like this, what will happen to me?
I hurriedly thought of 'Thoughts of almost everything'.
What items are useful right now?
The 'Poison Bomb' has already been used up so there is no more, so should we try hiding using the 'Everchanging Stealth Suit'?
Or should I at least use [Incite]?
Fortunately, the incarnations that were closing the distance stopped with about ten meters left.
Looking closely, I saw that they were also keeping each other in check.
One of the incarnations, who had been spewing out threats and killing intent to me, opened his mouth first.
"<Olympus>. You didn’t forget your promise, right?"
Looking at the Halloween party-like costume, it is an incarnation belonging to <Ghost House>. The answer was the 'Gatekeeper of Thebes' from <Olympus>.
"Don’t worry. You’ll get your share as well. The mythical-grade constellations have just concluded an agreement."
When the 'Gatekeeper of Thebes' answered, the incarnations of <Ghost> looked at me.
"Then everyone shares equally."
Eat? What do you eat?
You should ask my doctor too, you bastards.
As I watched the guys approaching me step by step, I gathered my strength once again.
I felt like I was relying too much on my sponsor.
Now I have to do some work too.
"I am Kim Dokja."
I began, slightly twisting my lips.
"A lot of people have gathered. But what happened in your 'Ginnungagap' and is it like this?"
"Don’t listen to him. He’s just trying to kill time. Now—"
"Aren’t you curious? Why did 'Valkyrie’s Daughter' end up like that?"
"At most, he dealt with one great- grade..."
After all, I don’t know these kids very well.
I grinned and snapped my fingers in the air. Of course, I didn't have to snap my fingers, but I just did it.
"Now, for the first time in the <Star Stream>, the inside of 'Ginnungagap' is revealed."
<!>[The story of a tale whose name has not yet been decided begins!]
My story, whose name has not yet been revealed, began to speak. Then, as if they had been waiting, I heard a message from the constellations.
<!>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is viewing the tale!]
<!>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is viewing the tale!]
<!>[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is viewing the tale!]
<!>[A few constellations are surprised after reading your story!]
Originally, 'Ginnungagap'  was a stage where no records of any stories were left.
However, I was able to leave a story safely thanks to the effect of 'Recorder of Things That Will Disappear’.
<!>[The constellations of the Nebula <Asgard> are astonished.]
<!>[The nebula <Asgard> requests the management to restrict access to the records!]
The truth about 'Ginnungagap' is spreading widely.
<Asgard>'s disgraceful behavior to catch me was quickly spreading throughout the <Star Stream>.
<Asgard> belatedly started to block it, but the constellations had already read the story that was heard infrequently.
"Gatekeeper of Thebes, is that true?"
One of the incarnations of the <Guardian Tree>, who had been silent the entire time, asked.
"That guy took care of ten great-grade constellations who used half-descent?"
"It doesn’t make sense… It can’t be like that."
"Didn’t 'Valkyrie’s Daughter' go out alone?"
Some incarnations take a step back. A hole was opened in the circular siege of the incarnations.
I could vividly feel the stirring of the constellations.
I didn't miss the opportunity and took a step forward.
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.10' is activated.]
"Now you know who you guys are dealing with."
The surprised incarnations took a step back one after another.
'Gatekeeper of Thebes', who realized that the atmosphere was unusual, shouted.
"It’s bullshit! Don’t be fooled! Even if that story is true, he has already used up all of his strength in 'Ginnungagap'. If we join forces and kill him now—"
I burst out laughing. The gatekeeper of Thebes silently fell silent due to that maniacal laughter.
"It seems like you didn’t understand even though I gave you a chance."
"You, what—"
"I killed ten great-grade constellations in the seventh scenario. And the story I’ve accumulated hasn’t been given a 'name' yet. Don’t you know what this means?"
I saw a few quick-witted incarnations rolling their eyes.
An unnamed tale.
In other words, my story wasn't 'complete' yet.
"If you help me here, you will be able to receive a share of the tale I will receive."
<!>[A very small number of constellations are surprised by the proposal of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]
<!>[The constellation 'Reclining Dragon' admires your tongue.]
<!>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is interested in your remarks.]
A confused silence fell among the bustling constellations.
They came here to join forces to eliminate the 'Demon King of Salvation' and obtain’ 'Kim Dokja’s Fragment'.
However, looking at their expressions, the majority of people here did not yet understand exactly what 'Kim Dokja’s Fragment' was.
"Choose. Either attack me foolishly and get kicked out of the scenario without even getting your money’s worth."
They now have another option.
"Or maybe you will join hands with me and share a story that is definitively 'legendary' or higher."
