<title>638 Episode 16 Mad Butcher (7)
Punishment.
An authority that a station leader can use to control his or her group members.
<!>['Discipline' is affected by the flag level.]
<!>[Currently, your flag rank is 'Purple'.]
The higher the grade of the flag, the higher the power of the authority.
Perhaps the ark gave to me in advance knowing how things would turn out.
Maybe.
For me now, 'the system' is the only weapon against them.
Tsutsutsutsuchu!
At the same time as the punishment was activated, pure white lightning flashed across the entire body of the ark in front of me.
"That, that, that...?"
The dragon-headed ark with his eyes wide open trembled as if in pain. A rustling sound came from his half-open lips.
"Buy! Girl!"
At the same time, standing by his side, four beggars each pulled out their batting balls.
But I was neither surprised nor embarrassed.
"You seem to be misunderstanding something."
<!>[Use 'discipline'.]
"They are now my 'family' too."
Electricity raged, and the envoys who rushed towards me knelt on the floor. As if the pain was severe, some of them even missed the mallet and were complaining of pain.
"Ugh, ah, ah, ah."
I wonder if it's still bearable, the ark still glaring at me was not on his knees.
I breathed in lightly and used 'punishment' once again.
<!>[Increase the level of 'punishment'!]
The purple flag sucked my mana, and an even more powerful electric shock burned the whole body of the ark.
Eventually, the knees of the ark bent down.
<!>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' admires your base!]
It was natural.
Unfortunately, this world was not a favorable place for an Outer God.
They were the beings who were abandoned in the 'scenario', and this was the world of the scenario.
A world with fixed stories, roles, and main characters. Like minor actors who are no longer used, this world doesn't want a 'god from another world'
<!>[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' orders a stronger punishment.]
<!>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' shouts, saying that miscellaneous things from the other world are being installed.]
<!>[The constellation 'Flying Dragon' says he needs to taste some bitterness.]
<!>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' licks his lips.]
I smiled bitterly at their reaction.
Indeed, when a truly terrifying deity from the other world descended from the 'Dark Castle' or the 'Pandemonium', none of them helped Kim Dokja.
That meant that the Outer God in front of me right now was not a high-level Outer God like 'The Nameless Mist'.
When one of the old beings, 'Eater of Dreams', descended in 'Omniscient Reader', the entire Dark Castle was almost destroyed. However, this guy didn't have the momentum to overwhelm the whole area.
Probably a sub-species equivalent to 'nameless things', among them, those with a rank similar to or lower than that of the constellation.
I spoke to the deity dwelling in the ark.
"What are you? Why are you here?"
Ordinarily, it was impossible to even talk to an 'Outer God'.
Because the moment they hear their voices, ordinary mortals lose their reason in madness and fear.
But the guy in front of me was different.
Perhaps because it coexists with the soul of a constellation in a human body, it was possible to speak and listen to it through human voice.
The next moment the guy opened his mouth.
"We are."
Vomit poured out of the mouth of the ark with the sound in Seoul Station. Black blood vessels stood out all over his body.
I rushed to ask.
"You saw me earlier and called me the world's recorder. What does that mean?"
The man raised his head again and said each word clearly.
"Recorder."
Now, the guy with blood vessels sticking out to his lips vomited out his words as if it were difficult.
"Recorder of Fear."
In an instant, goosebumps appeared on my forearms.
Recorder of Fear.
Certainly, there were beings with such a title in 'Omniscient Reader'.
<&>「Recorder of Fear. The first humans to meet the Outer Gods, and the writers who spread their existence.」
However, there was no description of who they were or what kind of existence they were.
"You smell like them."
"Tell me more. What kind of people are the 'recorders of fear'?"
But instead of answering, he just stared blankly at me.
Somewhere, I heard the sound of a small bird chirping.
<&>「Savemesavemesaveme」
<&>「Weareinnocentweareinnocentweareinnocent」
<&>「Don'tforgetdon'tforgetdon'tforget」
The distant universe, the sound from beyond the 'Great Hall'.
The ark opened his mouth again with eyes looking for sympathy.
"Recorder of Fear."
<&>「Writeitdownwriteitdownwriteitdownwriteitdown」
"Forgive me."
I was immediately taken aback by the tone that seemed to be praying for a mistake. Perhaps it was because of the screams of the stories that resonated in my head, but my heart weakened for a moment and I lowered the level of 'punishment'.
"Ark. Calm down. Are you intending to have your possessed body stolen by the Outer God?"
If the punishment continued to intensify like this, it seemed that the ark's possessed body would not be able to withstand it. Then the spotted boy would lose his father.
The Ark seemed to have heard me, but his eyes returned in an instant.
"Punishment."
But the ark couldn't speak any further. I don’t know if he meant to make the punishment stronger or weaker. The eyes of the ark were completely black, and both hands of the ark on his knees touched the floor.
The moment when a bleak sensation rose up my spine.
I looked back and cried.
"Everybody cover your ears!"
MurimMurimMurimMurimMurimMurimMurimMurimMurimMurimMurimMurimMurimMurimMulimMurimMurimMurimMurimMurimMurim」
At the same time, nearby beggars collapsed with blood flowing from their ears.
I too stumbled and knelt down.
<!>[Exclusive skill 'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World' is strongly activated!]
If it wasn't for the 'Ways of Survival' that was activated just in time, I would have become a chisel like them.
<&>「Yoo Joonghyuk knew. There is only one way to get out of the spiritual soak when you meet an 'Outer God'.」
<&>「Only believe in the story you have.」
I didn't have a story.
<&>「Yoo Joonghyuk thought.」
However, there was the story of 'Ways of Survival'.
<&>「'I am a regressor, my time is infinite. I will become infinitely stronger, so the day will surely come when I become stronger than I am. The definite future is soon a fact. Therefore, I am already stronger than the Outer God.'」
It was painful to listen to Yoo Joonghyuk’s bizarre logic, but I was able to stay sane anyway thanks to 'Ways of Survival'.
Fortunately, the mantra of the 'Outer God' did not continue.
Instead, the darkness covering the ground around the area began to radiate strange energy.
<!>[A world view check occurs.]
A worldview invasion?
<!>[Anomalies from another world rise in the dark.]
Strange creatures crawled out of the unarmored floor.
In an instant, my heart skipped a beat.
<&>「If a monster like the 'Nameless One' pops up here, we will die.」
Fortunately, what came out of the darkness was not the 'Nameless One'.
It is the main scenario after the 90th scenario where the 'Nameless One' is on the ground.
Right now, the Earth is only in the fourth scenario.
Then what are those?
The smell of old books flowing around the unarmed ground, and the smell of grass and soil that can only be rolled in deep mountains.
There was something that jumped out at me.
After the fourth scenario, 'Capture the Flag', the 'Fifth Scenario' begins.
Once opened, the invasion from Kronos’s world begins.
However, those monsters were not the creatures of 'Kronos' no matter how you look at them.
<!>[The 8th grade alien species, the Jiangshi, stand up in the dark.]
Beggars screamed and whipped batons against them. Jung Heewon, Sergeant Jung Moonho, and Sergeant Kim also shouted while protecting their colleagues.
Even with my width, I could see several Jiangshi turning around.
It was difficult to understand the situation.
I know the worldview invasion has begun.
But why did it suddenly appear here?
The 7th level extraterrestrial wind, 'Reduce City', reveals its hostility towards you!
As I dodged the attacks, I recalled the contents of the 'invasion of the world view' in my head.
<&>「The fifth scenario is a confrontation between worlds. Humanity fighting against the attacking other world. Just as Seoul is being eroded by Kronos, China will be eroded by the 3rd Murim World, and Japan will be eroded by the White Yo World.」
The 3rd Murim Realm.
Only then did it feel like everything was connected as one.
Of course, the dragon head ark from Murim appeared here. Everything made sense, even the sudden appearance of a group called 'Beggar Sect' in Korea.
<&>「'The 3rd Murim World' is a world view where the development of the Dragon's Head Ark ran away with the Beggar Sect.」
In other words, that meteorite from another world that can be seen right in front of me is...
<&>「Originally, a meteorite that should have fallen in China.」
Did it all start with this meteorite?
A sigh came out inside.
I don't know which dokkaebi didn't do things right, but-
—Hey, are you alive?
An inconsistent voice. The dokkaebi, gasping for breath in the air, continued.
—Damn it, a low-class dokkaebi set the meteorite's fall point incorrectly... can you handle that?
I know very well how the public situation is going.
'No problem.'
-Really?
I nodded.
We've come this far, but if the administration suddenly intervened and took away the reward, that would be a bigger problem.
'Please prepare the reward right away.'
Rather, it is an opportunity.
It happened that the ark didn't give me the summoning class elixir, so if I deal with that godhead, I might be able to receive a reward equivalent to that from the administration.
If only there was one problem.
"Go go go go go go go..."
In order to prevent this situation, the ark had to be killed.
<!>[The 7th grade alien species 'Steel City' is roaring at you!]
My forehead was cut by the long fingernails of Steel City.
Unfortunately, with my current abilities, I can't take down many of the 7th class.
But they were Jiangshi, and I had a holy relic.
I called up the bamboo pole with 'thought', and immediately injected magic power into it.
<!>['Bamboo pole' demonstrates powerful anti-demon powers!]
This bamboo jang is a holy relic with the strongest anti-demon function on the Korean Peninsula.
In other words, it was a perfect match for Jiangshi, a type of devil.
<!>[The 7th grade alien species, 'Steel City' feels fear and backs down.]
I ran past the Jiangshi without missing the timing.
<!>[Activate 'Discipline' at full output!]
Aaaaaaa!
The authority of the system began attacking the Outer God. The area of invasion of the worldview that had been spreading blackly shrank in an instant.
"Die, Ark!"
I swung the bamboo stick straight at the guy.
Of course, I didn't really mean to kill him.
If this vessel dies, the spotted boy's father will die too.
What matters is the gesture.
A gesture that at least I will definitely end this situation.
<!>[The incarnation 'Myung Sewoon''s being dwells all at once canceling the possession!]
Also.
Right before the bamboo shard touched it, the 'Outer God' turned into a whitish spiritual body and came out of the body. In an instant, it circled the ceiling of Seoul Station, and soon found a new object of possession and rushed at it.
<&>「IwantyouIwantyouIwantyouIwantyou」
I knew exactly where he was going.
<&>「Writeitdownwriteitdownwriteitdownwriteitdown」
That was me.
Tsutsutsutsutsutsu!
When the aura of divine power that flew in an instant struck me directly at the top of my head, the world went completely dark.
It was a feeling I had never experienced before, but I knew a sentence to accurately describe it.
<&>「It's like when Kim Dokja was swallowed by the 'dream eater' in the 'Dark Castle'.」
When I fully opened my eyes, I was in my spirit body.
What I see around me is a pure white field of snow.
<#>【Stupid recorder】
Here is my 'inner world'.
<#>【Cross-clap-clap】
I turned my head to the place where I heard the strange laughter. I saw a guy who had infiltrated my world.
The shape of a cephalopod about ten meters long. That seemed to be his body.
It's smaller than the 'Dream Eater' that Kim Dokja dealt with, but at least he didn't seem to be an ordinary guy as he signed a contract with a constellation.
<!>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' asks what happened.]
<!>[The constellation 'Goryeo's First Sword' says that it seems that a monster from the other world entered the body of that incarnation.]
<!>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' sponsors you with 100 coins and asks if you're okay.]
I heard a message from the stars who couldn't look inside me.
<!>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' worries about your safety.]
<!>[The constellation 'The Prisoner of the Golden Headband' asks the Administration Bureau to send out the screen.]
It's a shame that I can't show the scenery here to those stars, but maybe one of them can see this scenery.
"Ark."
<!>[The constellation 'The Last Ruler' watches your battle.]
It seemed so.
Since the development of the Dragon's Head Ark has been contracted with that 'Outer God', he will probably be able to watch this story.
"From now on, I will show you the story you want."
This is a story for only one spectator.
<!>[The skill 'Incite Lv.6' is activated!]
In the reality outside, I disguised as Kyrgios with [Incite]. However, I lacked magic power and lacked proficiency in martial arts, so what the Ark and the constellations actually saw were just weak illusions based on their memories.
But here it is different.
<!>[Scalar's penalty in that area is temporarily lifted!]
Here, neither physical fatigue nor probability affects us.
<!>[Enter the snow field.]
<!>[Describe your actions.]
<!>[5 probability points are exhausted.]
This space is pure white paper. The only power to rule this space is imagination.
<&>「Writer Lee Hakhyun started writing a sentence.」
Just like when I fought with Han Sooyoung.
<!>[The constellation 'Last Ark' sighs and breathes.]
The magic of the [White and Blue Steel] that fills my whole body. As I slowly blinked, I could feel the energy of Kyrgios that brightly colored the surroundings.
My magic-powered hair was dyed azure and swayed in the wind.
<&>「Kyrgios Rodgrim was there.」
Perhaps realizing that something was wrong, the Outer God panicked and backed away from the floor, then started running away.
<#>【Kak Kak Kak Kak Kak Kak Kak Kak】
White-blue, the word that perfectly suited Kyrgios blossomed into a tale in my hands.
Kyrgios's exclusive weapon.
<&>「Pure White Paradox.」
When I laughed, Kyrgios laughed.
<&>「"Get out of here, monster from the other world."」
A speed with no time to follow with the eye.
The wave of lightning that erupted from the tip of the blade burned the fleeing Outer God and cut it in two.
