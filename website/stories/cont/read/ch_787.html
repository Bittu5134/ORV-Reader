<p class="orv_line">My heart was beating wildly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I’m dying. I’m really dying here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see my death on the coming day.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The very scene where Jung Heewon killed Cheon Inho. The incident that shocked everyone at Geumho Station was about to be reenacted before my eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「It’s because Jung Heewon pierced Cheon Inho’s face from the crown down.」</div>「It’s because Jung Heewon pierced Cheon Inho’s face from the crown down.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">And there was the Demon King of Salvation looking at me from the other side of the incident.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of &lt;Olympus&gt; are absorbed into the stage!]</div>[The constellations of <Olympus> are absorbed into the stage!]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of &lt;Veda&gt; are absorbed into the stage!]</div>[The constellations of <Veda> are absorbed into the stage!]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of &lt;Asgard&gt; are absorbed into the stage!]</div>[The constellations of <Asgard> are absorbed into the stage!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The directing ability of the story that even made the enemy constellations absorbed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was purely amazed by that ability and nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know that he doesn’t want to kill me either. But he has to act that way anyway. That’s the scenario. This is a game where only one Kim Dokja can survive.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「That fact made my heart beat.」</div>「That fact made my heart beat.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swung my &#x27;Unbreakable Faith&#x27; to block the rushing sword. However, even though I activated [Time of Judgement] by using [Incite], [Sentence Strengthening], and [Bookmark], I could not stop the flow of the stage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Blood burst from the corner of my mouth, and shallow sword wounds remained on my waist and shoulder.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「This is the power of history that Kim Dokja survived with all his might.」</div>「This is the power of history that Kim Dokja survived with all his might.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sword strikes of the Demon King of Salvation became faster and faster, and I continued to be pushed back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, the Demon King of Salvation&#x27;s sword pierced through my gap.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought that I really couldn&#x27;t avoid it this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Dokja!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone pushed me, and a small explosion occurred in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you doing? Come to your senses.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first glance, it was a tone that could be mistaken for Yoo Jonghyuk&#x27;s. But that won&#x27;t happen anymore. Because I know who he is.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s join forces!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The SecondApostle, Killer King had finally arrived here. And that wasn&#x27;t all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We&#x27;re here. Friend.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansu, who had appeared leading a large number of low-level loyal servants, charged the army of bugs toward the Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m here too! Ughhhhhhh! I&#x27;m scared to death!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who had used [Average Correction] to increase her stamina to the limit, clashed with the Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the Demon King of Salvation&#x27;s body was pushed back by the reckless charge, a splendid sword light flashed in the sky.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Baek Cheong Gang Gi, who was much more skilled than me, was embroidering the air and restraining the Demon King of Salvation.]</div>[Baek Cheong Gang Gi, who was much more skilled than me, was embroidering the air and restraining the Demon King of Salvation.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Go, Yerin!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Literary Girl 64, Cha Yerin, spun around in the air and fell down like a top. The combined attack of Killer King and Cha Yerin, the ultimate command of [Daejeon Action Mode] had been activated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kwakwakwakwakwa! A blow that could shatter Lee Hyunsung&#x27;s steel-like armor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, the Demon King of Salvation did not fall. He simply silently swung his sword and blocked Cha Yerin&#x27;s attack.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cha Yerin&#x27;s body was thrown toward the group with a huge shockwave.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He&#x27;s strong.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cha Yerin&#x27;s hand, which had collided with the Demon King of Salvation, was swollen red.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He&#x27;s unbelievably strong.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because he&#x27;s Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I told Cha Yerin that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And we&#x27;re Kim Dokja too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With these people, we can fight no matter how far behind we are. Although we haven&#x27;t lived as long and distant a history as the Demon King of Salvation, we&#x27;ve done our best to get here.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The 41st world line is our world.」</div>「The 41st world line is our world.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The stories we&#x27;ve shared together began to stir and boil together.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation also seemed to know that fact, so he lightly flicked his fingers into the air.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;High-level Demons&#x27; Appear!]</div>['High-level Demons' Appear!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;High-level Demons&#x27; rose up simultaneously in the water.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Be careful!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the high-level demons surrounded the forest in an instant, the group centered around Killer King stood guard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Formation A. Everyone gather!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There&#x27;s no such thing!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Dokja! Come to your senses! We&#x27;ll take care of these guys!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of people being hit and broken was heard here and there. Kyung Sein&#x27;s screams and Dansu&#x27;s credit. Killer King&#x27;s energy mixed together to form a mess.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#x27;t help but feel ashamed of the thought of salvation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;re really a brilliant leader.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s right. We&#x27;ve lived through such a chaotic history. We&#x27;ve endured life by following the actions of the characters and reenacting the stories we liked. That&#x27;s how we got here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You can&#x27;t kill me with stories like that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The combined attack of the high-level demons would have been difficult to deal with in the past. Nevertheless, the group held on well. They held on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. It&#x27;s a mess all the time, so I&#x27;d like a story where no one dies.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The eyes of the Demon King of Salvation wavered at my answer. I didn&#x27;t miss that moment and rushed toward him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A sword strike flew from the air once more.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You know how that story ends, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you still going to continue that story?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded firmly and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s our story, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation&#x27;s blade shook subtly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I made another bold move.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;Tenacious Martial Arts Master&#x27; begins its storytelling!]</div>[The story 'Tenacious Martial Arts Master' begins its storytelling!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pushed my sword without stopping.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A story received from Yongdubangju Cheongae.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All the stories I had learned and mastered were embedded in my blade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you remember? When we first met. You gave me a lot of advice back then.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even now, when I close my eyes, a clear voice comes to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—What kind of characteristic is the circulatory delay?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—[Incite] Why can’t you use it like that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Do you know any other stories besides 「Persistent Martial Arts Master」?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—And that’s not all the skillsyou’ve gotten. Why don’t you use [Nagak Breathing]? Do you practice Skill Linking?</p>
<p class="orv_line">These were the homework assignments left to me after the Demon King of Salvation disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While I was staying at the Recycling Center, I practiced stories and skills day and night. I knew that my proficiency wouldn’t increase enough with just this short period of practice, but I didn’t rest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just like the day I first started writing a novel, just like that time when I wrote and erased countless sentences, I trained all the possibilities I had.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The proficiency of the exclusive trait &#x27;Circulation Delay&#x27; has achieved great success!]</div>[The proficiency of the exclusive trait 'Circulation Delay' has achieved great success!]</p>

<p class="orv_line">With one breath, the magical power swelled like wildfire. The &#x27;Circulation Delay&#x27; characteristic was linked to [Nakgak Breathing].</p>
<p class="orv_line">The long breath I sucked in circulated the magical power of my entire body, making it possible to link incredible skills.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Baek Cheong Gang Gi and 「The Tenacious Martial Arts Master」.]</div>[Baek Cheong Gang Gi and 「The Tenacious Martial Arts Master」.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The mutually contradictory martial arts and stories harmonized, and the ether blade rose from my swordplay.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swung my sword while holding my breath. I swung my sword again and again until my breath ran out. Blood spurted onto my cheeks and the broken stories scattered. My breath reached the tip of my chin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation was looking at me in such a desperate manner.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「You&#x27;ve improved a lot, youngest.」</div>「You've improved a lot, youngest.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued to swing my sword while hiding my pent-up emotions.</p>

<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Yes, it&#x27;s still not enough.」</div>「Yes, it's still not enough.」</p>

<p class="orv_line">The moment the flow of &#x27;Circulation Delay&#x27; and &#x27;Nagak Breathing&#x27; ended, the weapon of the Demon King of Salvation, who had been pushing forward, changed. The form of &#x27;Thought&#x27; had changed into the &#x27;Ttang Kang-A-Chwi-Kal&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The weapon that Jung HeeWon used when she killed Cheon Inho in the 1,864th round.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The effect of &#x27;Simple Stage&#x27; has increased!]</div>[The effect of 'Simple Stage' has increased!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation was saying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order to change this story, I have to change it myself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I have to destroy the history he has built up from the past head-on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth with all my might as I watched Jung Heewon&#x27;s sword flying towards me to finish Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I am not Cheon Inho!&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill &#x27;Incite Lv. 10&#x27; is activated!]</div>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv. 10' is activated!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">A spark fell from the air, and the Demon King of Salvation&#x27;s sword was twisted.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The reproducibility of &#x27;Simple Stage&#x27; is reduced!]</div>[The reproducibility of 'Simple Stage' is reduced!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blow that would have definitely killed me missed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was because the stage effect was weakened due to [Incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">But even with that [Incite], the stage effect could not be dispelled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation shook his head and worked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s amazing, you can now use [Incite] well, but…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He already had the power to resist my [Incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well, if I had been able to [Incite] the Demon King of Salvation in the first place, I wouldn&#x27;t have been pushed back in this fight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it would have been better if I had just a little more time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If only I had time to examine each and every one of the legends I had accumulated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I didn&#x27;t have time, and the Demon King of Salvation&#x27;s blade was too close. A squeak, and weakness came over me. The incarnation body that had been pushing itself hard since absorbing Goo Seonah had finally reached its limit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I acknowledged it. What kind of ability did I have now? Even if I exert myself, I cannot beat the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is my sponsor. What I can do, he can do too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is the first Kim Dokja of this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The older brother of all Kim Dokjas, and the constellation that introduced me to &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The match is not over yet. Don&#x27;t look at me with those eyes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Youngest.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The eyes of the approaching Demon King of Salvation were shaking. The fear that I might really die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at that fear straight in the eye and laughed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I told you. I will become the first Kim Dokja who will never die. Because—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew from the beginning that I could not defeat him. He had been a narrative-grade constellation for a long time, and I was just an incarnation that could now act as his representative.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So I waited.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I bought time until someone who could truly defeat him appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I absolutely do not intend to be the main character.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sword of the Demon King of Salvation that had been rushing towards me was deflected. The power that could block the attack of that powerful narrative-grade constellation. While the surprised Demon King of Salvation widened his eyes, a man in a fluttering black coat gave an order.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Lee Hyunsung! Lee Jihye! Shin Yoosoung! Kim Namwoon!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The four people who received the order jumped out from the bushes. The combined attack of the four people seemed to be pushing back the forces of the upper-level demons little by little.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「There was Yoo Jonghyuk, who held the Moongeuk.」</div>「There was Yoo Jonghyuk, who held the Moongeuk.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was just the appearance of the main character, but it felt like the sentences that had been chaotically scattered were finding their places. I sighed involuntarily. I realized once again whose &#x27;story&#x27; this world was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In an instant, Yoo Jonghyuk cleaned up the surroundings and stood next to me and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s pathetic.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I looked ahead with a bitter smile, the Demon King of Salvation was also facing me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation standing alone without any companions. His one starlight seemed a little lonely at that moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is that so?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Starlight seemed to be counting down the years, and also seemed to be reminiscing about the old story in the scenario that had now become worn out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That guy was the Yoo Jonghyuk you discovered.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#x27;t even imagine the feelings of the Demon King of Salvation. All I could do was nod.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation smiled faintly. That smile was all we could share at the moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You really intend to kill me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, he knew all about my plan. In order to counter the 「Staging」 on the other side, we had to use 「Staging」 on this side as well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We had to recreate the only stage in this universe where we could kill the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Both he and I knew very well what that &#x27;stage&#x27; was.</p>
