<p class="orv_line">To conclude, please refrain from changing letters’ size from now on, do it on a separate copy instead. I’ve manually removed all the suggestions concerning big changes on the previous chapters and I’ve put a notice about it in the first chapter (603), and every 20 chapters until now for the ones with a different starting point.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thanks for reading. ^^</p>
<p class="orv_line">(Now stop fighting and go back to peacefully reading in the theater with the other Kim Dokja fragments. Nice kidnapper Asmodeus even prepared food and drinks for us.))</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">At first, I thought I heard it wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What are you going to resurrect?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why are you looking like that? Have you changed your mind now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly took a deep breath and hid behind Kang Ilhun and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kang Ilhun-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you know what kind of being Yoo Joonghyuk is?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kang Ilhun tilted his head and looked back at me as if he didn&#x27;t understand the intention of my question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is there anyone who doesn&#x27;t know Yoo Joonghyuk?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You know that Yoo Joonghyuk is a regressor, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Of course I do.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, if it&#x27;s the latter half of the scenarios, everyone would know that much. Then the conversation would be easy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then you must know how much Yoo Joonghyuk doesn&#x27;t fit with the word &#x27;resurrection&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The concept of &#x27;resurrection&#x27; definitely exists in this crazy &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, Kim Dokja successfully resurrected several times by using his own characteristics, and Nirvana also used a similar ability called &#x27;reincarnation&#x27; by combining the power of the backstory and the story. Shin Yoosoung, who did not have the resurrection trait in the 41st round, was also reborn as a dokkaebi by Kim Dokja&#x27;s design.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Considering these cases, it seems that in this world, if you can somehow preserve your &#x27;soul&#x27;, there is a possibility of resurrection.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Yoo Joonghyuk is an exception.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That bastard, he already regressed. Have you forgotten?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is different from the cases of Kim Dokja or Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s soul does not go to the &#x27;underworld&#x27; even if he dies. This is because his soul belongs to the &#x27;Oldest Dream&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In short, Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s soul is no longer in &#x27;this worldline&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Kang Ilhun looked like he didn&#x27;t know anything about such things.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you get hit in the head by the Blood Demon? Wasn&#x27;t it your plan to revive Yoo Joonghyuk?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sighed inwardly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My plan?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho, what on earth were you thinking while living in the 40th round?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The One who Deceived the Stars.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kang Ilhun&#x27;s voice calling me contained a subtle murderous intent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Me, Lee Dansu, Kyung Sein, Ye Hyunwoo... We came here only believing in you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You didn&#x27;t become weak-hearted after coming this far, did you? Of all people, you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, too much information poured in, so I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was what.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Let&#x27;s say Kang Ilhun was like that. Why did Lee Dansu, Kyung Sein, and Ye Hyunwoo&#x27;s names come up again?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I first organized the newly acquired information one by one and looked closely at the man in front of me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation, &#x27;Kang Ilhun&#x27;, is showing deep favor to you.]</div>[Incarnation, 'Kang Ilhun', is showing deep favor to you.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kang Ilhun. There was no doubt about it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This person was the incarnation of &#x27;Killer King&#x27;. The extra villain of Chungmuro ​​Station—&#x27;Rumor Expert&#x27; Kang Ilhun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there was one strange thing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kang Ilhun had a scar in the shape of a line on his neck. It was as if someone had attached the head and torso, the skin of a subtly different color. Looking closely, the color of his hands was strangely blue.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The subject is currently in a &#x27;living dead&#x27; state.]</div>[The subject is currently in a 'living dead' state.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Oh my. No way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kang Ilhun&#x27;s eyes strangely glowed as he looked at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;To find out the secret of this world, to destroy the final scenario, I sacrificed my soul. I came here trusting only you. But now you—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A voice like a flowing stream of water.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as I was thinking that this human might be better at [Incite] than me, a shout erupted from the cover in front.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Give me Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s head!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Blood Demon, who had regained his momentum, was running toward us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Head! Head! Head! Head!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sight of dozens of incarnations running toward us while shouting &quot;Head!&quot; was truly a sight to behold. If Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s head hadn&#x27;t been dangling from my waistband, I would have clapped my hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly hid behind Kang Ilhun and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do something about it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">While Kang Ilhun was looking at me with a look of astonishment, the Blood Demon who had discovered us shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kang Ilhun? You bastard Cheon Inho! It&#x27;s true that you revived the Ten Evils! How dare you revive the Ten Evils with the body of the Blood Demon that I created—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the moment when I wondered what that meant, the Blood Demon&#x27;s subordinates shot arrows.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Arrows with powerful energy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I thought I was about to die, Kang Ilhun stopped me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Push, push.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Over a dozen arrows pierced Kang Ilhun&#x27;s body in an instant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shouted in surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you doing!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you worried about me right now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m sorry, but you just became an arrow skewer? It&#x27;s strange that I&#x27;m not worried.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kang Ilhun looked at me as if he was looking at a strange creature and then added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Run now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There&#x27;s nowhere to run, so where am I going?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What the hell are you talking about? Have you really forgotten the plan?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time as Kang Ilhun spoke, a portal opened behind us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Go. I&#x27;ll buy you some time.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s go together.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Stop talking nonsense and hurry into that portal— ugh!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I carried Kang Ilhun and jumped straight into the portal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You can&#x27;t go, you guys!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The long, stretched out hands of the Blood Demon barely managed to grab Kang Ilhun&#x27;s nape.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Startled, I instinctively grabbed Kang Ilhun&#x27;s head and pulled with all my strength.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kuaaaaah!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, a scream that I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was the Blood Demon&#x27;s scream or Kang Ilhun&#x27;s scream resonated. There was a sound like something was being torn apart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was rolling around inside the portal. My stomach turned inside out, and then I saw the portal&#x27;s entrance closing in a whirlwind. The transmission had ended safely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I held Kang Ilhun&#x27;s torn head in my hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kang Ilhun&#x27;s head spoke. &quot;Please put it back on.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, Kang Ilhun&#x27;s head closed his eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I felt a sudden surge of fatigue.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see the faces of several people running towards me from afar. Was it an illusion? I could see the face of Dansu ahjussi, the face of Kyung Sein, and the face of Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I waved my hand in joy.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Warning. Your incarnation has reached its limit.]</div>[Warning. Your incarnation has reached its limit.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">My consciousness went out.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly regained consciousness at the sound of a commotion. The first thing I heard was the man&#x27;s voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He waved at us earlier, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What do you think?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hmm.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He finally turned around?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He might have hurt his head.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, it must have been a ruse. He&#x27;s trying to set the stage in advance so that he won&#x27;t keep his promise to us.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;re going overboard with just one wave. Kyung Sein.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I opened my eyes, I saw the three people backing away in surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared blankly at their faces. At first, I thought I was dreaming. They were all faces I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And even Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first to react was Kyung Sein.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you awake, Cheon Inho?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not only was the way she spoke, but I could tell the moment I saw Kyung Sein&#x27;s eyes. He wasn&#x27;t the &#x27;Judge&#x27;s Wife&#x27; Kyung Sein that I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What a pitiful sight. Kang Ilhun, whom I saved with great effort, ended up like that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansu and Ye Hyunwoo added a word each.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#x27;t scold him too much. He went all the way to &lt;Olympus&gt; like that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;At least Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s head was recovered safely.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared blankly at the three of them before opening my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Excuse me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was it because of my tone? Or was it because of my changed mood?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo asked with an anxious expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you planning? Cheon Inho.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you develop a new [Incite] method?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, that&#x27;s not it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was wondering how I should explain this situation, and then I noticed Kang Ilhun&#x27;s head on the table next to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, Kang Ilhun had asked me if I had been hit in the head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I decided to take his advice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I had a slight head injury. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t remember well.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;A head injury? You?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The three of them made expressions as if it couldn&#x27;t be true.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo asked with a more serious expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you get hit by the Blood Demon?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then Poseidon?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I nodded, the three of them looked at each other and soon gave each other a look of agreement.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If he had definitely been hit in the head by that bastard&#x27;s trident, he wouldn&#x27;t be in his right mind.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;d like to hear an explanation of the situation. What did I do to end up like this, and why is Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s head here? Who are you—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You forgot even such basic things?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll remember them anyway, but to save time, could you give me a brief explanation?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The three of them still looked suspicious that I was acting. However, whether it was acting or not, Ye Hyunwoo realized that proper communication was impossible, and eventually opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Okay. I&#x27;ll explain it to you once, so listen carefully.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">For about 10 minutes, I heard about the current status of the 40th round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After listening to Ye Hyunwoo, I chewed over the information several times. Then I slowly opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So... the only humans left are me and the Blood Demon gang, and you are the &#x27;Ten Evils&#x27; that I resurrected. Is that right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had roughly expected this, but it was shocking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How did I revive you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You used [Deceased Summoning].&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Deceased Summoning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I never thought that Cheon Inho, in the 40th turn, would have that horrible skill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I also knew a lot about [Deceased Summoning]. This skill was originally used by Yoo Joonghyuk, in his 1208th round, who had transitioned to the &#x27;Lord of Death&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A skill that borrows the souls of a giant nebula by making a contract with its underworld.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Depending on how you use it, it is possible to create a one-man army by gathering powerful incarnations of past lives as immortals.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seems that these people were also revived by planting the souls I borrowed through [Deceased Summoning] into their blood vessels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But that skill isn&#x27;t that easy to use.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Deceased Summoning had some pretty tricky conditions.]</div>[Deceased Summoning had some pretty tricky conditions.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">One was that there had to be a &#x27;head&#x27; of a dead person. And the two—</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;[Deceased Summoning] can only be used when there is a special contract with the underworld. It’s not like I can summon just any soul and plant it in your body.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how corrupted the giant nebula was, there was no way a piece of trash like Cheon Inho could make a contract with the giant nebula and the underworld.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Have you forgotten that there is no underworld in this world?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at him with a dumbfounded face and asked back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Didn’t you destroy the &lt;Underworld&gt; by causing discord among the nebulas?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I gaped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo looked at me pitifully and added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The &#x27;Underworld&#x27; doesn’t exist in the current world.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo walked toward me and held out the tablet he had taken out from his bosom.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thanks to you, the world became like this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The tablet was showing the CCTV screen installed nearby.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Countless evil spirits roaming the dead land. From the 8th level Specter to the 5th level Night Ghost, the entire Korean peninsula was a paradise for evil spirits.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this what a world without the afterlife looks like?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What on earth did Cheon Inho want to do in this world, committing such acts?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why did I save you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because you couldn&#x27;t clear the &#x27;last scenario&#x27; alone!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">One memory came to mind at Ye Hyunwoo&#x27;s words.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Ten evils. Help me. I need your help.&quot;」</div>「"Ten evils. Help me. I need your help."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ten Evils.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t mishear. The people in front of me right now were the &#x27;Ten Evils&#x27; of the &#x27;40th round&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Fourth Evil Kang Ilhun.」</div>「Fourth Evil Kang Ilhun.」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Fifth Evil Ye Hyunwoo.」</div>「Fifth Evil Ye Hyunwoo.」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Eighth Evil Lee Dansu.」</div>「Eighth Evil Lee Dansu.」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Ninth Evil Kyung Sein.」</div>「Ninth Evil Kyung Sein.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">And.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「First Evil Cheon Inho.」</div>「First Evil Cheon Inho.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was amazing that the small villains survived and became the Ten Evils, and it was strange that Cheon Inho was determined to clear the last scenario by saving them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I checked the log messages to see what the last scenario was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Scenario #99 of the main story was &#x27;Destroy the Ark&#x27;, but here...</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Main Scenario #99 - Scheduled Ending&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Main</p>
<p>Difficulty: ???</p>
<p>Clear Conditions: Destroy the Ark guarded by the constellations within the time limit and reach the &#x27;Final Wall&#x27;.</p>
<p>Time Limit: 30 days</p>
<p>Reward: Final Wall</p>
<p>If you fail: World Line Destruction.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">I read and reread the main scenario. And I cursed inwardly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn it.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[To clear the &#x27;time fault&#x27;, you must complete the &#x27;last scenario&#x27;.]</div>[To clear the 'time fault', you must complete the 'last scenario'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Destroy the ark guarded by the constellations and reach the &#x27;Final Wall&#x27;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Easier said than done. Is this really the last scenario of the 40th round? There is no &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; or Yoo Joonghyuk in this world line?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked again, trying to hold onto a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are there any constellations that side with the incarnations? Like Uriel or Jecheon Daeseong.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s stupid. Where is a constellation that sided with an incarnation?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The ones who sided with humans all died during the last &#x27;Final Dragon&#x27;, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Oh my. It was a truly hopeless situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But this time, you defeated Poseidon and brought back &#x27;Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s head&#x27;, so we have a chance of winning.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s head again?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sighed and shook my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s head is of no help.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What nonsense are you talking about? Didn&#x27;t you say that if only you could revive the Supreme King...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Resurrection itself is impossible.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t know whether I should tell them the truth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">These extras who could finally dream of the end of this world. Could I tell these incarnations who had never been given proper ground in the main story that Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s soul was not here, so we could not receive help from the tyrant, and that the destruction of this world was set in stone?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「And at that moment, a small spark flew in Cheon Inho&#x27;s head.」</div>「And at that moment, a small spark flew in Cheon Inho's head.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wait a minute.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Is there really no way to save Yoo Joonghyuk?」</div>「Is there really no way to save Yoo Joonghyuk?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s head that was neatly placed on the table, then hurriedly looked up into the air. As if there was someone I couldn&#x27;t see there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo, surprised by my actions, asked nervously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What&#x27;s going on? Is this an attack?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is there a body to connect to Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s head right now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There is a body, but didn&#x27;t you just say that resurrection is impossible?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s right. If it&#x27;s as I think, Yoo Joonghyuk can&#x27;t be revived even if [Deceased Summoning] is used. This is because Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s soul from the 40th round has already left this world line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「What if, in this &#x27;time fault&#x27;, there&#x27;s &#x27;one more&#x27; Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s soul?」</div>「What if, in this 'time fault', there's 'one more' Yoo Joonghyuk's soul?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of the monitor of the &#x27;40th time fault&#x27; that was completely dark.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What if that black screen didn&#x27;t mean Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s failure or death?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s start [Deceased Summoning] right now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">So what if, in the &#x27;41st round&#x27;, Yoo Joonghyuk hadn&#x27;t found a suitable &#x27;possession target&#x27; yet?</p>
