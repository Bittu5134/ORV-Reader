<p class="orv_line">I ran like crazy while carrying Yoo Jonghyuk. My panting breaths reached the tip of my chin, and my heels kicked the dirt floor.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「There was no need to do this.」</div>「There was no need to do this.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know. My actions right now are useless. This scene is just a virtual &#x27;40th round&#x27; staged by &#x27;Fear&#x27;. Whether I save Yoo Jonghyuk here or not, the story that has already been decided will be recorded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I couldn&#x27;t shake off the eerie imagination.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Will it really be recorded?」</div>「Will it really be recorded?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">What if this &#x27;Fear&#x27; is real?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What if Yoo Jonghyuk dies because I don&#x27;t save him now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What if history changes like the 1,863rd round that Kim Dokja visited?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There he is! That bastard!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At least Yoo Jonghyuk of the 40th round wasn&#x27;t destined to die here. And now, I was the only one who could save him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wake up! Hey!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shouted at Yoo Jonghyuk several times, but he didn&#x27;t respond.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After running away for several hours, I felt my stamina and magic power slowly draining away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn it, Cheon Inho, didn&#x27;t he even properly raise his overall ability? How on earth did someone like this get nicknames like &#x27;Evil Sophist&#x27; or &#x27;The One Who Deceived the Stars&#x27;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That’s it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A storm of incredible magical power swept in from in front of me along with the familiar voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was clear who he was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Blood Demon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A legendary martial arts master who had once joined forces with the Heavenly Demon and even faced the &#x27;Breaking the Sky Sword Saint&#x27; was right in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely a Transcendent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was an incarnation with strength that rivaled even the highest-ranking constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered why such a big shot had suddenly appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheon Inho, why did you suddenly betray us?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seems that the big shot knows Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth with a hurried smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I didn’t betray you in particular.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Put down the tyrant.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That would be a bit difficult. This guy has a place where I can use him.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You must be thinking of uncovering the true nature of the Regression Law.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Regression Law.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Blood Demon seemed to know that Yoo Jonghyuk was a Regressor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We must have decided to conduct research on the Law together, didn&#x27;t we?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">What on earth was Cheon Inho doing in the 40th round?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could guess the situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That greedy Blood Demon must have been curious about why Yoo Jonghyuk was so strong. After investigating, he found out that Yoo Jonghyuk was a Regressor, and he set a trap with Cheon Inho to steal his power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, my line was set.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will uncover the Regression Law and tell you. So, Blood Demon, please step aside for a moment.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How can I trust you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The Supreme King is already in a state of extreme insanity. If we leave it like this, he will regress before we even find out about the Regression Law.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As you know, I have [Incite]. After recovering Yoo Jonghyuk a little, if I [Incite] Yoo Jonghyuk while his mental barrier is weakened, we may be able to find out the secret of regression—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will count to three.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blood demon&#x27;s voice was cold.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Leave the tyrant behind and get out. Then I&#x27;ll spare your life.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I guess this kind of persuasion won&#x27;t work.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I compared the intensity I felt from the blood demon&#x27;s body with the strength I had. No matter how much I thought about it, I couldn&#x27;t deal with the blood demon with such a weak body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only way to deal with the blood demon was to wake up Yoo Jonghyuk, but the probability of him waking up after using [Knight Resurrection] was close to zero.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, why did this kid come to an area where blood cultists were swarming in the first place and make things complicated...</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Why did Yoo Jonghyuk come all the way here?」</div>「Why did Yoo Jonghyuk come all the way here?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sparks flew in my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I carefully moved my hand behind my back and checked one of the wooden armors in the guy&#x27;s arms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I read the Chinese characters engraved on the armor, I could immediately understand why Yoo Jonghyuk had come all the way here.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Hyeolryeongdan.」</div>「Hyeolryeongdan.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">A potion similar to the &#x27;Gongcheongseokyu&#x27; or &#x27;Doll Theory&#x27; of &lt;The 0th Murim&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just by taking one pill, you can gain magical powers of over a hundred years. It was a legendary divine water.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps Yoo Jonghyuk came here to get this item.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don’t know. He might have wanted to take it himself, or he might have wanted to give it to someone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took out the blood spirit tablet from the wooden box and the blood demon smiled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you think the situation will change if you eat that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said, pretending to be indifferent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;At least I can get the blood cult’s divine water. If I eat this, you won’t be able to absorb the magic of the Blood Spirits.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Blood Spirits are a sacred item passed down through generations for the cult’s leaders. It was a terrible item made by sacrificing more than ten thousand masters in order for mortal humans to reach the stars.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I think the Blood Demon who killed the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint also absorbed this &#x27;Heolryeongdan&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So if I threaten him with this item, even if it’s the Blood Demon…</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Try it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sensed the dark magic rippling in the Blood Demon’s grasp.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Absorption Technique.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An extremely evil magic technique that absorbs the magic directly from the opponent’s body to increase his own internal energy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did I realize the Blood Demon’s plan.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I secured the magic with the Blood Spirits, the Blood Demon planned to use [Absorption Technique] to take away the magic.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Eat it right now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I cursed inside, but there was no other way. Anyway, I’ll die anyway. If so.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then I will eat well.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Without hesitation, I poured the blood spirit tablet inside the wooden armor into my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blood demon&#x27;s eyes flashed red and burst into rage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You idiot. If you eat that as is... !&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know. Blood Spirit Dan has side effects. The moment you take this medicine, ten thousand vengeful spirits in the pill will attack the user&#x27;s mind at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Hahahahahahahaha!</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You finally took it!</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I&#x27;ll kill you, I&#x27;ll kill you, I&#x27;ll kill you!</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Cult leader! You&#x27;re finally getting revenge on a hundred years of grudge!</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Huh...?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill &#x27;Fourth Wall&#x27; is activated!]</div>[Exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is activated!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The voices of the vengeful spirits that had been heard disappeared in an instant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While the astonished Blood Demon glared, I felt the intense magical energy pulsating throughout my body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Item &#x27;Blood Spirit Dan&#x27; matches your characteristics.]</div>[Item 'Blood Spirit Dan' matches your characteristics.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">I wondered if this was only making Cheon Inho stronger, but there was no way for me to survive right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Blood Demon, who barely managed to calm his confusion, said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Blood Demon. Have you forgotten who I am?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I am the &#x27;evil sophist&#x27; and the &#x27;star-deceiver&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know if Cheon Inho is still called that, but I talked as I pleased and lured the blood demon into letting down his guard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The great blood demon tried the absorption method first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Die!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I barely avoided his attack and unleashed my only special skill.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill &#x27;Incite Lv. 10&#x27; is activated!]</div>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv. 10' is activated!]</p>

<p class="orv_line">It felt completely different from the [Incite] I had done before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it because the body I possessed was &#x27;Cheon Inho of the 40th round&#x27;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The possible and impossible [Incite] orders were neatly organized in my head.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The &#x27;order&#x27; to die is impossible.」</div>「The 'order' to die is impossible.」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Use the words that can be used on opponents of similar rank first.」</div>「Use the words that can be used on opponents of similar rank first.」</p>

<p class="orv_line">It was as if someone was telling me how to use [Incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">I calmly took a breath and spoke to the blood demon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you nervous? Are you afraid that I&#x27;m stronger than you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Shut up! You—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let me tell you something important. Even if you obtain the Great Law of Regression, you will never become as strong as the Supreme King.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill &#x27;Incite Lv. 10&#x27; is activating!]</div>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv. 10' is activating!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blood demon, with his eyes wide open, shouted at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What do you know—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;From a lowly third-rate villain. On your first trip to the martial arts world, you accidentally collected the remains of a previous great demon and acquired the &#x27;Blood Spirit Divine Skill&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the blood demon&#x27;s secret that also appears in &#x27;Ways of Survival&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blood demon glared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, how did you—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You probably know that too. Your talent is not even capable of properly mastering one &#x27;Blood Spirit Divine Art&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You trained for a hundred years and still can&#x27;t master that one martial art, and you couldn&#x27;t even endure the &#x27;Time Fault&#x27; and jumped out, so how dare you pursue other martial arts?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;With that much willpower, you dream of &#x27;regression&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Incite&#x27; is strengthened.]</div>['Incite' is strengthened.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Blood Demon staggered and shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I can do it too. If I can return, if I can regress like that guy—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No. You can&#x27;t. Regression is useless to you, who can&#x27;t even endure a mere hundred years.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s not true. I— Me too—!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blood demon&#x27;s eyes were suddenly clouded. The demon inside him had manifested </p>
<p class="orv_line">doubts about his talent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Concerns about his will.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All the history that had made him a transcendent was now his enemy, attacking his mind.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Incite&#x27; is strengthened.]</div>['Incite' is strengthened.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Just as a roach can only become a &#x27; roach that has lived for a hundred years&#x27; even if it endures for a hundred years, it cannot become a dragon, no matter how much you struggle, you are a third-rate unmanned rascal. Even if you gain good martial arts or return, it is the same. That is your birth. That is how you have lived until now with such a weak mind.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Incite&#x27; is strengthened!	]</div>['Incite' is strengthened!	]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There is no need to struggle. The sky is high, and the stars are far away. There is no place for you in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;. You are nothing more than a speck of dust that cannot even play a supporting role. Accept that fact. Then you will be at ease.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah, uh, uh—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Go back to where you lived. And don&#x27;t stick your head out again.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Incite&#x27; succeeded!]</div>['Incite' succeeded!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a while, the blood demon, unable to endure the pain, lay on the ground, flailing its mouth as if it were a loach.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though I was watching the process of [Incite] developing in real time right before my eyes, it didn&#x27;t feel real.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho has used this devilish tongue to subdue countless opponents.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at the blood demon for a moment and then started running again.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incite doesn&#x27;t last long. I had to get as far away from here as possible before Incite was released.]</div>[Incite doesn't last long. I had to get as far away from here as possible before Incite was released.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh my God! How much are you!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blood cult group that had already chased me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Chase them! There!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I ran and ran, but now there was no more escape. The cliff was blocking my way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stood at the edge of the cliff and looked down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What I could see from the edge of the cliff was the rough yet still flowing river.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had no choice now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hold on tight, Yoo Jonghyuk.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grabbed the guy by the collar and jumped down the cliff.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is not Dongho Bridge, and there is no ichthyosaurus to swallow us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had a feeling that we would not die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was, so to speak, a writer&#x27;s intuition.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho and Yoo Jonghyuk would not die here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And if the two of them survived here.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You intervened in &#x27;SVRP&#x27;.]</div>[You intervened in 'SVRP'.]</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk was looking up at the night sky of Murim. It was a night sky filled with constellations he hated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How long had he been looking at the constellations like that? Yoo Jonghyuk unconsciously began to count the stars hanging in the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was strange. He had no habit of counting stars, so why was he counting them?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Hold on tight, Yoo Jonghyuk.&quot;」</div>「"Hold on tight, Yoo Jonghyuk."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">A memory suddenly flashed through his mind. A subtle warmth that did not fit with his life. A sudden bond that should not exist for him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Disciple.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk woke up from his thoughts at the voice from behind him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was looking down at him as if worried.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A bright light was emitting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Breaking the Sky Sword Saint finally recognized her disciple who had reached the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Which round has this been when you have given me memories?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s the 32nd round.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think this is the 41st round.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There are also rounds where you have not given me memories.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Breaking the Sky Swordsman did not ask why he had not given her memories. She simply smiled lightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you gave me your memories, it means you have a desperate reason.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk&#x27;s regression draws in and devours everyone around him. It destroys them. It dismantles lives and wears out existence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, Yoo Jonghyuk once again dragged Breaking the Sky Swordsman into the vortex of regression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I must become stronger.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You are already strong enough. Stronger than the last time, and the time before that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I must become stronger than that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;For what reason?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk did not answer, but Breaking the Sky Swordsman heard the answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Strangely, the two of them had the same face at that moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s strange.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#x27;t understand it either.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, it&#x27;s time for my blunt disciple to make a friend.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s not the reason.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Breaking the Sky Sword Saint smiled faintly at Yoo Jonghyuk, who shook his head. Then, her expression hardened for a moment and she asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you thinking of entering the time rift?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know what it means for you to enter the Time Rift.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">To most mortals, the &#x27;Time Rift&#x27; is a worthless darkness where nothing exists.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the void where only the density of time is extremely concentrated, mortals test their limits and challenge transcendence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, some &#x27;Time Rifts&#x27; are different. There are stories within those Time Rifts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A Time Rift with a much harsher survival difficulty than a Time Rift filled only with emptiness, but one that offers unimaginable rewards if you can clear it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You must return to the world you failed to protect again.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Breaking the Sky Sword Saint knew whose story that &#x27;Time Rift&#x27; was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The more often you visit there, the more crazy you will become. No matter how strong your mind is, you cannot endure such things repeatedly.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Still, I must go.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, who confirmed that her disciple&#x27;s determination would not change, asked with a light sigh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. Are you going now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Get ready. I will accompany you to the entrance of the Rift.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Breaking the Sky Sword Saint asked again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you going to use the 32nd fault this time?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 32nd fault was the worst fault that Yoo Jonghyuk had used in the 40th round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There, Yoo Jonghyuk gained the power to bring down even the stars.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Time that had fallen asleep like a fossil buried deep inside.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In some time faults, there were stories that even he had not experienced.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk looked up at the sky for a moment and opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This time, I plan on going to the &#x27;40th fault&#x27;.&quot;</p>
