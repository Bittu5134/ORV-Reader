<p class="orv_line">He&#x27;s back, right? He&#x27;s back, right? He&#x27;s back? She smiled brightly! Sooyoung can&#x27;t be so bright if it&#x27;s not the case! —(Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint, Chapter 551)</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>I recently told my friend about this novel.. He said it was fun.. Happy...</p>
<p>—(Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint, Chapter 551)</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Somehow it didn’t feel real.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of Goo Seonah I saw in Chungmuro. Her expression was somehow poisonous and her eyes were strong. She didn’t trust people easily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Goo Seonah in the Internet comment window was different from the Goo Seonah I knew. Her comments were lively, her joy and sadness were clear, and I couldn’t sense even a shadow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I read and reread the last comment she wrote. Then, a conversation suddenly came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be exact, it wasn’t my memory, but the memory of the acting person &#x27;Kim Kyungsik&#x27; that I had absorbed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In my memory, the two of them were sitting on the platform in Chungmuro ​​and chatting away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The memory was damaged, so I couldn’t hear most of the conversation well, but I could hear a few words from Goo Seonah clearly.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;There&#x27;s someone I need to find.&quot;」</div>「"There's someone I need to find."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah&#x27;s expression as she said those words was also vivid.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;If I possessed someone in this world, that guy would definitely be here too.&quot;」</div>「"If I possessed someone in this world, that guy would definitely be here too."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe this is why I can&#x27;t ignore her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her life is not here. So I have a duty to send her back to her own world. I&#x27;ve always thought that way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Goo Seonah, what on earth have you done?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah, whose eyes met mine, had a face that was even more like &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27; than &#x27;Jung-chul&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She tilted her head with a subtle smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her gaze fell on the floor. There were the mortal bodies of the incarnations that were limp.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#x27;ve never talked to them directly, but they were all faces I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Students from Class A.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Tiger Eating Rice Cake&#x27; cries out in pain while feeling nauseous!]</div>[The constellation 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' cries out in pain while feeling nauseous!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were students who were the terminal incarnations of &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Pig Living in a Brick House&#x27; breaks the brick house in agony!]</div>[The constellation 'Pig Living in a Brick House' breaks the brick house in agony!]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Nail-Eating Rat&#x27; bites his nails and goes into a seizure!]</div>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' bites his nails and goes into a seizure!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The screams of the constellations echoed in my ears. </p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Tiger Eating Rice Cake&#x27; goes into a frenzy.]</div>[The constellation 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' goes into a frenzy.]</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Nail-Eating Rat&#x27; goes into a frenzy.]</div>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' goes into a frenzy.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah, who has become even more like &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27; than before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations that are dropping as if they are dead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations are in pain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I just made it easier for you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah was saying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You know that too. These guys, they barely have any &#x27;reader&#x27; egos left. So I&#x27;m going to cut out that part and put it in a bag.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then the readers—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">She smiled brightly and pointed at herself with her thumb. The intense and ominous feeling felt from her whole body,</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;The Master of Sim-i-ja&#x27; is out!]</div>[The story 'The Master of Sim-i-ja' is out!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">She had absorbed the &#x27;Kim Dokja fragments&#x27; that the constellations of &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; had.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why are you looking at me like that? They&#x27;re the ones who harassed us. You must have had a hard time because of them too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s right. I had a hard time because of them too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In particular, when I met the &#x27;Tiger Eating Rice Cake&#x27; in the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; scenario, I almost died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But they weren&#x27;t hostile to me from the beginning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#x27;Tiger Eating Rice Cake&#x27;, the &#x27;Pig Living in a Brick House&#x27;, and the &#x27;Nail-eating Rat&#x27; were the same.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At Geumho Station, at Chungmuro ​​Station, and even during &#x27;The Sponsor Selection(?).&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were the constellations who cheered me on the most. Maybe that&#x27;s why I was always reluctant to confront them sincerely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if they had almost no &#x27;Reader&#x27; soul left, even if only 1 percent of the soul fragments remained, it was okay. For that 1 percent, I could have thrown myself at them over and over again to save them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I just did what you did. We&#x27;re the same.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I unconsciously took a step back as I watched Goo Seonah calmly spread her arms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So let&#x27;s just be one, Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Until now, I believed that there was a minimum level of good. I wanted to believe that she would at least not touch the same &#x27;reader&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But she crossed that line as if it were a joke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;re really good at talking like Nirvana.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was only one step.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that one step, Goo Seonah&#x27;s white hand, which had come close to my nose, reached out toward my neck.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I reflexively swung my &#x27;Unbreakable Faith&#x27; and swatted her hand away. Even though it hit her hand, there was a sharp, metallic sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her entire hand was shining like a fresh fingernail.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked into the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story of the &#x27;nail-eating rat&#x27;— 「The cornered fingernail」. A story that strengthens a part of the body to a level close to a sacred relic.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swung my sword once more. Her nails and the sword clashed several times, and the magical power that came into contact was canceled out and turned into a loud noise. Judging from the level of recoil, the amount of magical power and physical strength that each of us had were similar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah smiled brightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will kill the &#x27;Daemajok&#x27;. You just get out of here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why on earth are you doing this?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I didn&#x27;t start this. You started this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You haven&#x27;t even heard my story yet! You didn&#x27;t even ask what happened between me and Kim Kyungsik-ssi, or what you saw!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah&#x27;s nails that had been clashing fiercely stopped for the first time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Kyung-sik.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, my chance to speak had come.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What she saw that day was a misunderstanding, and while it&#x27;s true that I absorbed Kim Kyungsik-ssi&#x27;s soul, I never killed him. That&#x27;s what I tried to explain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I forgot. Did you think I was doing this because of that old man?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#x27;t because of Kim Kyungsik?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then why on earth does Goo Seonah have such strong hostility toward me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The crackling sound erupted once again, and we simultaneously took three or four steps back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah stared at me with clear eyes. Then she frowned as if she was displeased.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You really don&#x27;t know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You made everything happen with this and forgot about it yourself?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah let out a strange laugh and raised her hand. Soon, she snapped her fingers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart felt cold.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The soul she had absorbed, &#x27;Christina Page&#x27;s&#x27; special skill, had been activated.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Character &#x27;Goo Seonah&#x27; activates &#x27;Daily Corpse Lv. 10&#x27;!]</div>[Character 'Goo Seonah' activates 'Daily Corpse Lv. 10'!]</p>

<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I am &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27; who cannot be hypnotized.」</div>「I am 'Kim Dokja' who cannot be hypnotized.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the moment I activated [Incite], I realized something was strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was not the one on whom she activated [Daily Corpse].</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ll make you remember.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Character &#x27;Goo Seonah&#x27; activates &#x27;Hypnosis Incite Lv. 10&#x27;.]</div>[Character 'Goo Seonah' activates 'Hypnosis Incite Lv. 10'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, incarnations came out from all over the bushes, trembling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were all familiar faces.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung, Lee Jihye, Kim Namwoon, and even Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps due to the influence of [Daily Corpse], the four people&#x27;s eyes were empty.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung moved at the same time as Goo Seonah&#x27;s nod.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Character Lee Hyunsung activates &#x27;Mountain Breaker Lv. 9&#x27;!]</div>[Character Lee Hyunsung activates 'Mountain Breaker Lv. 9'!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung&#x27;s huge fist slammed into the ground. The dirt floor flipped over as if there was an earthquake, and a ringing sound was heard. While my senses were disturbed, Lee Jihye and Kim Namwoon rushed forward, piercing through the dust.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kaga River!</p>
<p class="orv_line">I held &#x27;Unbreakable Faith&#x27; and &#x27;Sain Chamsagum&#x27; in pairs and struck back at the two&#x27;s attacks. My palms were tingling from the heavy blows.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Next came Shin Yoosoung. The 8th-grade sea creatures controlled by the child began to play together.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Naggak Ensemble&#x27; is starting!]</div>['Naggak Ensemble' is starting!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the Naggak Ensemble was not toward me, but was rising in a completely different direction, creating dissonance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah frowned and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Shin Yoosoung, do it right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I watched Shin Yoosoung&#x27;s trembling shoulders, a strange dissonance arose in my heart as well.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;Heir of the Eternal Name&#x27; laughs brightly.]</div>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' laughs brightly.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to save up some strength for the final battle. But now I had to admit it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah is strong. If she can control such strong characters at will, she might be considered superior to the &#x27;higher-level demons&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She has collected that many &#x27;Kim Dokja fragments&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;Heir of the Eternal Name&#x27; begins its storytelling as if it had been waiting for it.]</div>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' begins its storytelling as if it had been waiting for it.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it had been before, it would have been a power that I would have used after watching the situation. But now that the world&#x27;s gaze is focused elsewhere, it would be okay.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[One of the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27;s&#x27; stories awakens due to the effect of &#x27;Heir of the Eternal Name&#x27;.]</div>[One of the 'Demon King of Salvation's' stories awakens due to the effect of 'Heir of the Eternal Name'.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;Bug Slaughter&#x27; can now be used temporarily.]</div>[The story 'Bug Slaughter' can now be used temporarily.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Story, 『&#x27;Bug Slaughter』.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the story that the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; obtained after defeating the demon count &#x27;Tentachio&#x27; in the Dark Castle.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「A tale of overwhelming power when the opponent is &#x27;weaker than you&#x27;.」</div>「A tale of overwhelming power when the opponent is 'weaker than you'.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, Lee Hyunsung was too strong to apply this &#x27;tale&#x27;. Kim Namwoon, Lee Jihye, and maybe even Shin Yoosoung were incarnations who could easily overwhelm me with their immediate performances.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was something they could never surpass me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「That&#x27;s the &#x27;strength&#x27; of the real story.」</div>「That's the 'strength' of the real story.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hmm, I took a deep breath and immediately put a stop to the strength that I had been holding back.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Demon King of Salvation (Agent)&#x27; reveals his strength!]</div>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation (Agent)' reveals his strength!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The movements of Lee Hyunsung and his party stopped in their tracks at the sudden release of strength.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t miss that moment and activated my skill.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill &#x27;Incite Lv.10&#x27; is activated!]</div>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.10' is activated!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, I didn&#x27;t want to use this skill on people I knew. But now, there was no other way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I placed my hand on Lee Hyunsung&#x27;s shoulder as he rushed toward me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill &#x27;Incite&#x27; is in sync with &#x27;Insect Massacre&#x27;.]</div>[Exclusive skill 'Incite' is in sync with 'Insect Massacre'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, that thought occurred to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe dreaming isn&#x27;t just about the &#x27;oldest dream&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「This world is a huge [Incite]. All beings are just moving from one dream to another.」</div>「This world is a huge [Incite]. All beings are just moving from one dream to another.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk, Cheon Inho, Asmodeus, Goo Seonah, and Ye Hyunwoo. They all have their own dreams. They also fight to bring the characters to their own dreams.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps, I am the same.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill &#x27;Incite&#x27; exerts an overwhelming influence on incarnations of lower rank than you!]</div>[Exclusive skill 'Incite' exerts an overwhelming influence on incarnations of lower rank than you!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, as always, there is something you must do first to dream a new dream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hyunsung-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wake up from the &#x27;old dream&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you remember the trumpet sound?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung&#x27;s shoulders began to shake like crazy.</p>
