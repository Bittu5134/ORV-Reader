<p class="orv_line">A chill passed over the nape of my neck.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' frowns.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It started with 'Heir of the Eternal Name'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Recorder of Things that will Disappear' expresses sorrow.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'One Who Rewrites Fate' gazes at fate.]</p></div>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' expresses hatred.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">To eliminate that being in front of me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' says that name is for only one person.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If I leave that being alone, it will threaten me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I shook my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you can't control stories, you will live according to the stories' will."</p>
<p class="orv_line">More than anything, I knew who that 'Kim Dokja' was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Goo Seonah-ssi." The moment I called her name, a loud thunder rumbled in the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was someone else in the distance overdoing the probability?</p>
<p class="orv_line">A pitch-black darkness was flowing out from the sky that was cracked as if it would break at any moment.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The probability constraints of the scenario weaken.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In any case, it made it easier for me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The worldview turns its eyes to the probability collision area.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As the worldview constraints weakened, the restrictions on speech loosened. Now, I could have a free conversation with Goo Seonah.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Goo Seonah-ssi. Let's stop now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah. I recalled the information I knew about her. There might be some clue left inside me that could convince her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her ID is strawberry1137.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reader level 46.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reading count 8 times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging from her ID, she's probably someone who likes strawberries. 1137 might be some kind of anniversary.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, March 7th of the 11th year. I shook my head. This wasn't enough. I needed more information about her.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Use 'Reader Comment List' on the person.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>* You can check the comments written by the reader using coins.</p>
<p>* Currently, there are 3 comments that can be checked for free.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">A skill that I didn't use often because I felt uncomfortable looking at other people's comments. But now, there was no other way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I activated the skill, the comments she had left came to mind one by one.</p>

<p>No, does this make sense? No matter what, it makes sense to split the reader in half? This is really the author's fault.</p>

<p>—(Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint, Chapter 551)</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Somehow it didn’t feel real.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of Goo Seonah I saw in Chungmuro. Her expression was somehow poisonous and her eyes were strong. She didn’t trust people easily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Goo Seonah in the Internet comment window was different from the Goo Seonah I knew. Her comments were lively, her joy and sadness were clear, and I couldn’t sense even a shadow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I read and reread the last comment she wrote. Then, a conversation suddenly came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be exact, it wasn’t my memory, but the memory of the acting person 'Kim Kyungsik' that I had absorbed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In my memory, the two of them were sitting on the platform in Chungmuro ​​and chatting away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The memory was damaged, so I couldn’t hear most of the conversation well, but I could hear a few words from Goo Seonah clearly.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "There's someone I need to find." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah's expression as she said those words was also vivid.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "If I possessed someone in this world, that guy would definitely be here too." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe this is why I can't ignore her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her life is not here. So I have a duty to send her back to her own world. I've always thought that way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Goo Seonah, what on earth have you done?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah, whose eyes met mine, had a face that was even more like 'Kim Dokja' than 'Jungchul'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She tilted her head with a subtle smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her gaze fell on the floor. There were the mortal bodies of the incarnations that were limp.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I've never talked to them directly, but they were all faces I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Students from Class A.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' cries out in pain while feeling nauseous!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">They were students who were the terminal incarnations of &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation 'Pig Living in a Brick House' breaks the brick house in agony!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' bites his nails and goes into a seizure!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The screams of the Constellations echoed in my ears.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' goes into a frenzy.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation 'Pig Living in a Brick House' goes into a frenzy.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' goes into a frenzy.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah, who has become even more like 'Kim Dokja' than before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations that are dropping as if they are dead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Constellations are in pain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I just made it easier for you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah was saying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You know that too. These guys, they barely have any 'reader' egos left. So I'm going to cut out that part and put it in a bag."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then the readers—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">She smiled brightly and pointed at herself with her thumb. The intense and ominous feeling felt from her whole body,</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'The Master of the Heart-Bearer' is out!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">She had absorbed the 'Kim Dokja fragments' that the Constellations of &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; had.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why are you looking at me like that? They're the ones who harassed us. You must have had a hard time because of them too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's right. I had a hard time because of them too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In particular, when I met the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' in the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; scenario, I almost died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But they weren't hostile to me from the beginning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake', the 'Pig Living in a Brick House', and the 'Nail-eating Rat' were the same.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At Geumho Station, at Chungmuro ​​Station, and even during 'The Sponsor Selection(?).'</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were the Constellations who cheered me on the most. Maybe that's why I was always reluctant to confront them sincerely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if they had almost no 'Reader' soul left, even if only 1 percent of the soul fragments remained, it was okay. For that 1 percent, I could have thrown myself at them over and over again to save them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I just did what you did. We're the same."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I unconsciously took a step back as I watched Goo Seonah calmly spread her arms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"So let's just be one, Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Until now, I believed that there was a minimum level of good. I wanted to believe that she would at least not touch the same 'reader'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But she crossed that line as if it were a joke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You're really good at talking like Nirvana."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was only one step.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that one step, Goo Seonah's white hand, which had come close to my nose, reached out toward my neck.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I reflexively swung my 'Unbreakable Faith' and swatted her hand away. Even though it hit her hand, there was a sharp, metallic sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her entire hand was shining like a fresh fingernail.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked into the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story of the 'Nail-Eating Rat'— 「The Cornered Fingernail」. A story that strengthens a part of the body to a level close to a sacred relic.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swung my sword once more. Her nails and the sword clashed several times, and the magical power that came into contact was canceled out and turned into a loud noise. Judging from the level of recoil, the amount of magical power and physical strength that each of us had were similar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah smiled brightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will kill the 'Daemajok'. You just get out of here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why on earth are you doing this?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn't start this. You started this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You haven't even heard my story yet! You didn't even ask what happened between me and Kim Kyungsik-ssi, or what you saw!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah's nails that had been clashing fiercely stopped for the first time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Kyung-sik."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, my chance to speak had come.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What she saw that day was a misunderstanding, and while it's true that I absorbed Kim Kyungsik-ssi's soul, I never killed him. That's what I tried to explain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I forgot. Did you think I was doing this because of that old man?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't because of Kim Kyungsik?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then why on earth does Goo Seonah have such strong hostility toward me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The crackling sound erupted once again, and we simultaneously took three or four steps back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah stared at me with clear eyes. Then she frowned as if she was displeased.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You really don't know?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You made everything happen with this and forgot about it yourself?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah let out a strange laugh and raised her hand. Soon, she snapped her fingers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart felt cold.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The soul she had absorbed, 'Christina Page's' special skill, had been activated.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Character 'Goo Seonah' activates 'Daily Corpse Lv. 10'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Daily Corpse is a skill that causes the soul to separate from the body as soon as it is activated. But I have a countermeasure.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I am 'Kim Dokja' who cannot be hypnotized. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But the moment I activated [Incite], I realized something was strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was not the one on whom she activated [Daily Corpse].</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll make you remember."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Character 'Goo Seonah' activates 'Hypnosis Incite Lv. 10'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, incarnations came out from all over the bushes, trembling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were all familiar faces.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung, Lee Jihye, Kim Namwoon, and even Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps due to the influence of [Daily Corpse], the four people's eyes were empty.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung moved at the same time as Goo Seonah's nod.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Character Lee Hyunsung activates 'Mountain Breaker Lv. 9'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung's huge fist slammed into the ground. The dirt floor flipped over as if there was an earthquake, and a ringing sound was heard. While my senses were disturbed, Lee Jihye and Kim Namwoon rushed forward, piercing through the dust.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kaga River!</p>
<p class="orv_line">I held 'Unbreakable Faith' and 'Sain Chamsagum' in pairs and struck back at the two's attacks. My palms were tingling from the heavy blows.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Next came Shin Yoosoung. The 8th-grade sea creatures controlled by the child began to play together.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Naggak Ensemble' is starting!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, the Naggak Ensemble was not toward me, but was rising in a completely different direction, creating dissonance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah frowned and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Shin Yoosoung, do it right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I watched Shin Yoosoung's trembling shoulders, a strange dissonance arose in my heart as well.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' laughs brightly.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to save up some strength for the final battle. But now I had to admit it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah is strong. If she can control such strong characters at will, she might be considered superior to the 'higher-level demons'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She has collected that many 'Kim Dokja fragments'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' begins its storytelling as if it had been waiting for it.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If it had been before, it would have been a power that I would have used after watching the situation. But now that the world's gaze is focused elsewhere, it would be okay.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[One of the 'Demon King of Salvation's' stories awakens due to the effect of 'Heir of the Eternal Name'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Bug Slaughter' can now be used temporarily.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Story, 『'Bug Slaughter』.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the story that the 'Demon King of Salvation' obtained after defeating the demon count 'Tentachio' in the Dark Castle.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 A tale of overwhelming power when the opponent is 'weaker than you'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, Lee Hyunsung was too strong to apply this 'tale'. Kim Namwoon, Lee Jihye, and maybe even Shin Yoosoung were incarnations who could easily overwhelm me with their immediate performances.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was something they could never surpass me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 That's the 'strength' of the real story. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Hmm, I took a deep breath and immediately put a stop to the strength that I had been holding back.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation 'Demon King of Salvation (Agent)' reveals his strength!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The movements of Lee Hyunsung and his party stopped in their tracks at the sudden release of strength.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't miss that moment and activated my skill.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.10' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, I didn't want to use this skill on people I knew. But now, there was no other way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I placed my hand on Lee Hyunsung's shoulder as he rushed toward me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Incite' is in sync with 'Insect Massacre'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, that thought occurred to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe dreaming isn't just about the 'oldest dream'.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 This world is a huge [Incite]. All beings are just moving from one dream to another. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk, Cheon Inho, Asmodeus, Goo Seonah, and Ye Hyunwoo. They all have their own dreams. They also fight to bring the characters to their own dreams.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps, I am the same.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Incite' exerts an overwhelming influence on incarnations of lower rank than you!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, as always, there is something you must do first to dream a new dream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hyunsung-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wake up from the 'old dream'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you remember the trumpet sound?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung's shoulders began to shake like crazy.</p>
