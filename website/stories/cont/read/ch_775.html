<p class="orv_line">A chill passed over the nape of my neck.</p>
[The story &#39;Heir of the Eternal Name&#39; frowns.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It started with &#39;Heir of the Eternal Name&#39;.</p>

<p class="orv_line">To eliminate that being in front of me.</p>
[The story &#39;Heir of the Eternal Name&#39; says that name is for only one person.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If I leave that being alone, it will threaten me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I shook my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you can&#39;t control stories, you will live according to the stories&#39; will.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">More than anything, I knew who that &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Goo Seonah-ssi.&quot; The moment I called her name, a loud thunder rumbled in the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was someone else in the distance overdoing the probability?</p>
<p class="orv_line">A pitch-black darkness was flowing out from the sky that was cracked as if it would break at any moment.</p>
[The probability constraints of the scenario weaken.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In any case, it made it easier for me.</p>
[The worldview turns its eyes to the probability collision area.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As the worldview constraints weakened, the restrictions on speech loosened. Now, I could have a free conversation with Goo Seonah.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Goo Seonah-ssi. Let&#39;s stop now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah. I recalled the information I knew about her. There might be some clue left inside me that could convince her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her ID is strawberry1137.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reader level 46.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reading count 8 times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging from her ID, she&#39;s probably someone who likes strawberries. 1137 might be some kind of anniversary.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, March 7th of the 11th year. I shook my head. This wasn&#39;t enough. I needed more information about her.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Somehow it didn’t feel real.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of Goo Seonah I saw in Chungmuro. Her expression was somehow poisonous and her eyes were strong. She didn’t trust people easily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Goo Seonah in the Internet comment window was different from the Goo Seonah I knew. Her comments were lively, her joy and sadness were clear, and I couldn’t sense even a shadow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I read and reread the last comment she wrote. Then, a conversation suddenly came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be exact, it wasn’t my memory, but the memory of the acting person &#39;Kim Kyungsik&#39; that I had absorbed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In my memory, the two of them were sitting on the platform in Chungmuro ​​and chatting away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The memory was damaged, so I couldn’t hear most of the conversation well, but I could hear a few words from Goo Seonah clearly.</p>
「&quot;There&#39;s someone I need to find.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah&#39;s expression as she said those words was also vivid.</p>
「&quot;If I possessed someone in this world, that guy would definitely be here too.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe this is why I can&#39;t ignore her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her life is not here. So I have a duty to send her back to her own world. I&#39;ve always thought that way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Goo Seonah, what on earth have you done?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah, whose eyes met mine, had a face that was even more like &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; than &#39;Jung-chul&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She tilted her head with a subtle smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her gaze fell on the floor. There were the mortal bodies of the incarnations that were limp.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#39;ve never talked to them directly, but they were all faces I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Students from Class A.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Tiger Eating Rice Cake&#39; cries out in pain while feeling nauseous!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">They were students who were the terminal incarnations of &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt;.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Pig Living in a Brick House&#39; breaks the brick house in agony!]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39; bites his nails and goes into a seizure!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The screams of the constellations echoed in my ears. </p>
[The constellation &#39;Tiger Eating Rice Cake&#39; goes into a frenzy.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Pig Living in a Brick House&#39; goes into a frenzy.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39; goes into a frenzy.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah, who has become even more like &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; than before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations that are dropping as if they are dead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations are in pain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I just made it easier for you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah was saying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You know that too. These guys, they barely have any &#39;reader&#39; egos left. So I&#39;m going to cut out that part and put it in a bag.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then the readers—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">She smiled brightly and pointed at herself with her thumb. The intense and ominous feeling felt from her whole body,</p>
[The story &#39;The Master of Sim-i-ja&#39; is out!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">She had absorbed the &#39;Kim Dokja fragments&#39; that the constellations of &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; had.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why are you looking at me like that? They&#39;re the ones who harassed us. You must have had a hard time because of them too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s right. I had a hard time because of them too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In particular, when I met the &#39;Tiger Eating Rice Cake&#39; in the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; scenario, I almost died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But they weren&#39;t hostile to me from the beginning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Tiger Eating Rice Cake&#39;, the &#39;Pig Living in a Brick House&#39;, and the &#39;Nail-eating Rat&#39; were the same.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At Geumho Station, at Chungmuro ​​Station, and even during &#39;The Sponsor Selection(?).&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were the constellations who cheered me on the most. Maybe that&#39;s why I was always reluctant to confront them sincerely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if they had almost no &#39;Reader&#39; soul left, even if only 1 percent of the soul fragments remained, it was okay. For that 1 percent, I could have thrown myself at them over and over again to save them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I just did what you did. We&#39;re the same.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I unconsciously took a step back as I watched Goo Seonah calmly spread her arms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So let&#39;s just be one, Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Until now, I believed that there was a minimum level of good. I wanted to believe that she would at least not touch the same &#39;reader&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But she crossed that line as if it were a joke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re really good at talking like Nirvana.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was only one step.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that one step, Goo Seonah&#39;s white hand, which had come close to my nose, reached out toward my neck.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I reflexively swung my &#39;Unbreakable Faith&#39; and swatted her hand away. Even though it hit her hand, there was a sharp, metallic sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her entire hand was shining like a fresh fingernail.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked into the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story of the &#39;nail-eating rat&#39;— 「The cornered fingernail」. A story that strengthens a part of the body to a level close to a sacred relic.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swung my sword once more. Her nails and the sword clashed several times, and the magical power that came into contact was canceled out and turned into a loud noise. Judging from the level of recoil, the amount of magical power and physical strength that each of us had were similar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah smiled brightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will kill the &#39;Daemajok&#39;. You just get out of here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why on earth are you doing this?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I didn&#39;t start this. You started this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You haven&#39;t even heard my story yet! You didn&#39;t even ask what happened between me and Kim Kyungsik-ssi, or what you saw!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah&#39;s nails that had been clashing fiercely stopped for the first time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Kyung-sik.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, my chance to speak had come.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What she saw that day was a misunderstanding, and while it&#39;s true that I absorbed Kim Kyungsik-ssi&#39;s soul, I never killed him. That&#39;s what I tried to explain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I forgot. Did you think I was doing this because of that old man?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#39;t because of Kim Kyungsik?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then why on earth does Goo Seonah have such strong hostility toward me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The crackling sound erupted once again, and we simultaneously took three or four steps back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah stared at me with clear eyes. Then she frowned as if she was displeased.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You really don&#39;t know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You made everything happen with this and forgot about it yourself?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah let out a strange laugh and raised her hand. Soon, she snapped her fingers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart felt cold.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The soul she had absorbed, &#39;Christina Page&#39;s&#39; special skill, had been activated.</p>
[Character &#39;Goo Seonah&#39; activates &#39;Daily Corpse Lv. 10&#39;!]</p></div>
[Daily Corpse is a skill that causes the soul to separate from the body as soon as it is activated. But I have a countermeasure.]</p></div>
「I am &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; who cannot be hypnotized.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But the moment I activated [Incite], I realized something was strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was not the one on whom she activated [Daily Corpse].</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;ll make you remember.&quot;</p>
[Character &#39;Goo Seonah&#39; activates &#39;Hypnosis Incite Lv. 10&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, incarnations came out from all over the bushes, trembling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were all familiar faces.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung, Lee Jihye, Kim Namwoon, and even Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps due to the influence of [Daily Corpse], the four people&#39;s eyes were empty.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung moved at the same time as Goo Seonah&#39;s nod.</p>
[Character Lee Hyunsung activates &#39;Mountain Breaker Lv. 9&#39;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung&#39;s huge fist slammed into the ground. The dirt floor flipped over as if there was an earthquake, and a ringing sound was heard. While my senses were disturbed, Lee Jihye and Kim Namwoon rushed forward, piercing through the dust.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kaga River!</p>
<p class="orv_line">I held &#39;Unbreakable Faith&#39; and &#39;Sain Chamsagum&#39; in pairs and struck back at the two&#39;s attacks. My palms were tingling from the heavy blows.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Next came Shin Yoosoung. The 8th-grade sea creatures controlled by the child began to play together.</p>
[&#39;Naggak Ensemble&#39; is starting!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, the Naggak Ensemble was not toward me, but was rising in a completely different direction, creating dissonance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah frowned and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Shin Yoosoung, do it right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I watched Shin Yoosoung&#39;s trembling shoulders, a strange dissonance arose in my heart as well.</p>
[The story &#39;Heir of the Eternal Name&#39; laughs brightly.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to save up some strength for the final battle. But now I had to admit it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah is strong. If she can control such strong characters at will, she might be considered superior to the &#39;higher-level demons&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She has collected that many &#39;Kim Dokja fragments&#39;.</p>
[The story &#39;Heir of the Eternal Name&#39; begins its storytelling as if it had been waiting for it.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If it had been before, it would have been a power that I would have used after watching the situation. But now that the world&#39;s gaze is focused elsewhere, it would be okay.</p>
[One of the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;s&#39; stories awakens due to the effect of &#39;Heir of the Eternal Name&#39;.]</p></div>
[The story &#39;Bug Slaughter&#39; can now be used temporarily.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Story, 『&#39;Bug Slaughter』.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the story that the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39; obtained after defeating the demon count &#39;Tentachio&#39; in the Dark Castle.</p>
「A tale of overwhelming power when the opponent is &#39;weaker than you&#39;.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, Lee Hyunsung was too strong to apply this &#39;tale&#39;. Kim Namwoon, Lee Jihye, and maybe even Shin Yoosoung were incarnations who could easily overwhelm me with their immediate performances.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was something they could never surpass me.</p>
「That&#39;s the &#39;strength&#39; of the real story.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Hmm, I took a deep breath and immediately put a stop to the strength that I had been holding back.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Demon King of Salvation (Agent)&#39; reveals his strength!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The movements of Lee Hyunsung and his party stopped in their tracks at the sudden release of strength.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t miss that moment and activated my skill.</p>
[Exclusive skill &#39;Incite Lv.10&#39; is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, I didn&#39;t want to use this skill on people I knew. But now, there was no other way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I placed my hand on Lee Hyunsung&#39;s shoulder as he rushed toward me.</p>
[Exclusive skill &#39;Incite&#39; is in sync with &#39;Insect Massacre&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, that thought occurred to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe dreaming isn&#39;t just about the &#39;oldest dream&#39;.</p>
「This world is a huge [Incite]. All beings are just moving from one dream to another.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk, Cheon Inho, Asmodeus, Goo Seonah, and Ye Hyunwoo. They all have their own dreams. They also fight to bring the characters to their own dreams.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps, I am the same.</p>
[Exclusive skill &#39;Incite&#39; exerts an overwhelming influence on incarnations of lower rank than you!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, as always, there is something you must do first to dream a new dream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hyunsung-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wake up from the &#39;old dream&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you remember the trumpet sound?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung&#39;s shoulders began to shake like crazy.</p>
