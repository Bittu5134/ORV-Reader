            <div class="orv_title"><h1>867 Episode 47 King of Fear (11)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation— The First Kim Dokja shouted as he hurriedly repaired the broken library.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (Kids! Stop it! Quickly!) 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the order of the Demon King of Salvation, the kkoma Kim Dokjas moved around. When some of them blocked the broken library frame with newspapers, the trembling stories became quiet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After the series of events that the Youngest experienced in the Fear Realm, the [Fourth Wall] became very unstable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was probably because this [Fourth Wall] itself was not complete.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The First Kim Dokja frowned and turned the newspaper on the table.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (Damn it, this is how it is—) 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, the events in the library were nothing compared to the events that the Youngest was experiencing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The [Fourth Wall] shook once again, and a new sentence was created in the newspaper.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Kugugugugugu! 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The confrontation between Kim Dokja and Kim Dokja continued on the blank sheet of paper.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Second Kim Dokja—the First Kim Dokja bit his lips after confirming 'that guy' who was confronting the King of Fear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He never thought that guy would show up!</p>
<p class="orv_line">He knew that the guy would often come to see the Youngest in the form of dreams, but he never expected that he would intervene so blatantly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It must be possible because it was the 'Snowfield'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Snowfield is a place that is least affected by the probability of the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in such a place, the entire Snowfield was filled with sparks due to the stories the two Kim Dokjas were spewing out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that the Youngest's thoughts floated over the newspaper.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Wait, could that person work too? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, the Youngest seemed to be thinking of stopping this fight. At his judgment, which was typical of the Youngest, the first nodded and thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it were me, who would I call? The [Unidentified Wall] has a limitation that it cannot send messages to other worldlines, so the choices were limited.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Breaking the Sky Sword Saint or Uriel.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was whether he could summon them to the Snowfield. No matter how strong the Constellation was, there were only a limited number of beings that the Youngest could summon to the 'Snowfield'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Eldest Kim Dokja, immediately turned on his smartphone and made a call.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (Damn, is the Third child on airplane mode again?) 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, the Third Kim Dokja, did not answer the call.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it didn't seem like he could ask for help from Yoo Joonghyuk or &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; of other worldlines.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the case of &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt;, there was no way to enter this Snowfield...</p>
<p class="orv_line">No way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Would only beings who could come to the Snowfield really be able to stop this situation?</p>
<p class="orv_line">An ominous feeling rose in his head.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (Wait a minute. Youngest, no way.) 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">No way. Even if the Youngest is crazy, he wouldn’t dare to take such a risk. If he makes a mistake, the entire Fear Realm could be blown away—</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (No way? Hey! You bastard!) 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then, the blank page on which the Youngest’s story was written slowly began to tear apart.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I told Jang Hayoung the name I had thought of and asked if she could send a message. Then Jang Hayoung answered.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Um, that person is not officially affiliated with the &lt;Star Stream&gt;?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Then it won’t work?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[The message can be delivered. This is the first time this has happened. It’s amazing.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then there’s hope.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is whether I can persuade 'that being'.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What should I send? By the way, I can only send one word.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Can you send an item as well?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As far as I know, the [Unidentified Wall] has a function that allows you to exchange skills or items.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What is it?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"This is it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung looked down at the item I handed her and nodded.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I can send this. What about the message?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After I took a deep breath and sent the message, Jang Hayoung tilted her head and asked back.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You really sent it like that?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[This is the first time I've received such a strange message since 'Grow Up, Hairy Head'... Okay, I sent it.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The message was sent. The message that flew through the wall must have crossed this 'Snowfield' and reached the man floating in space.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How would he react when he opened the message? Honestly, I didn't really expect it. He was such an unpredictable man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds... 1 minute.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Time passed, and there was no reply.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung asked after seeing my expression.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Are you anxious?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm anxious."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung looked at me blankly and said.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Kim Dokja was always anxious.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Was he? It's a little different from the Kim Dokja I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought about the Kim Dokja in the main story. The Kim Dokja I remember was always a calm man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung laughed.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[People who try too hard to hide it actually make it obvious.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja as a human being who wasn't recorded in the main story. Maybe Jang Hayoung read Kim Dokja's wall.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[When I see you, I think about that time a lot.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, I'm Kim Dokja too."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You try to think like that, right?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Does the [Unidentifiable Wall] also have the ability to blurt out other people's thoughts?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[That's a great Kim Dokja speech.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I tried."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I thought that was really unique. You're already Kim Dokja, but you're trying to become Kim Dokja.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I laughed weakly. Suddenly, a question I wanted to ask came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What kind of Kim Dokja was the King of Fear?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[A guy who understands sadness.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung continued speaking while looking up at the seal of Asmodeus floating in the air.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Even without saying anything, I felt understood when I stood next to him. I liked that feeling so I stayed by his side for a long time.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't you feel sorry?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[It's a shame. But there's nothing I can do. He said so. If something like this happens, don't interfere.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">She won't get involved in Kim Dokja's fight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That must have been the promise between the 'King of Fear' and the 'Fighter'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized it anew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How serious are both the King of Fear and Snowfield Kim Dokja in this fight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter who becomes the last Kim Dokja, they are simply trying to fill the gap in this story with 'Kim Dokja's War'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">On the other hand, what about me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm a coward."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Why?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Because I'm trying to borrow the power of another being for Kim Dokja's fight."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of Kim Dokja and the King of Fear, who were engaged in a fierce battle inside the seal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be honest, I had been overwhelmed ever since I witnessed their true power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought I had become quite strong after going through the 40th Time Fault. At least in this Snowfield, I believed that I could compete with anyone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But when I actually witnessed the two, that confidence disappeared as if it had been washed away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The feeling of seeing a being who was much more complete as 'Kim Dokja' than me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If we simply considered the number of 'Kim Dokja fragments' that I had, there wouldn't have been much of a difference between me and the 'King of Fear', but our levels of completion were noticeably different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The kind of 'gap in class' that only a being who understood the stories they had better than anyone else could express.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Is that a bad thing?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly woke up from my thoughts at Jang Hayoung's question.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Asking for help has always been Kim Dokja’s specialty.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you for the consolation."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Not consolation. I’m just telling the truth, and do you think it’s easy to become a coward?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung continued speaking without any noticeable change in expression.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Only those who know what’s important to them can become cowards. Kim Dokja knew that well. He could become a conman of this &lt;Star Stream&gt; for his colleagues many times.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"…"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Just like you are now.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That’s when my con is successful."</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was still no reply from the [Unidentified Wall].</p>
<p class="orv_line">From afar, with a squeak, I could see Asmodeus’s [Silver Screen Seal] breaking.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Keu…】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But I still had one more card left.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have successfully interpreted the ■■-level Fear, 'Evil Sophist'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Would you like to receive the delayed reward?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I had not yet received the reward for clearing the Time Fault 'Evil Sophist'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know what I will get with this reward, but if I use it, my chances of winning will go up a little.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I held on to my 'Unbreakable Faith' and took a deep breath. Even if I die here, even if I can't stop them, I will do what I can. Like Kim Dokja.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Wait.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, Jang Hayoung stopped me.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Something is here.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt it too. Something strange was approaching from across the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A huge force that tore apart the entire vast space and flew in. At that moment, Snowfield Kim Dokja, the King of Fear, and Asmodeus all had no choice but to look up at the sky with the same expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As something suddenly occurred to him, Asmodeus looked down at me and shouted.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【What on earth did you call—!】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at Asmodeus, whose face was pale, I recalled the name of the man I had called.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging by the fact that something like that was flying towards me, it seemed that my message had arrived properly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, the message I sent him was as follows.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—I will take you back to the past you wanted to go back to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When Jaehwan first received that message, he thought that there was a crazy guy in this universe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was clear who the crazy guy was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Judging by the way he speaks, it's that guy."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It must have been that Heo Yeo-geon—the guy who called him 'Jaehwan-nim'—who sent him nonsense.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He must want to die, judging by the nonsense he sent."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Monarch Slayer Jaehwan.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyone who knows him even a little bit knows that the word he hates the most is 'regression'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because of that damn 'regression', he lost his comrades, lost his friends, and had to continue his journey alone up the terrifying 《Tower of Nightmare》.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How dare he offer to 'regression' to him?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Regardless of whether the offer was possible or not, it was something that only a human who had escaped the temporary ship could dare to do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jaehwan began to put strength into the sword he had taken out of his waist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It seems he’s hiding in a strange place."</p>
<p class="orv_line">His power as an Awakened person was manifested.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Suspicious and Understanding. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The path the message had come from was clearly visible on his retina.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you think I wouldn't be able to find you if you hid?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jaehwan's sword strike began to condense the tremendous stabbing energy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sparks exploded like firecrackers all over his body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Management Bureau has detected your dangerous actions!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, a pure white spark net spread around him. As if someone was trying to restrain his actions, putting a limit on probability on him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A dazzling pillar of light began to descend from the sky.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Great Dokkaebi, 'Halong', descends to the area!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Great Dokkaebi, 'Holong', descends to the area!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Great Dokkaebi, 'Noksoo', descends to the area!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Great Dokkaebi, 'Onsae', descends to the area!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Great Dokkaebi, 'Haesol', descends to the area!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As many as five Great Dokkaebis appeared in the scenario to stop him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Great Dokkaebis.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Except for the 'Dokkaebi King', the king of stories, these are the Executive-level dokkaebis who can wield the most powerful power in the Management Bureau. The fact that five of them appeared at the same time was an unusual event even in the long history of the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jaehwan quickly realized who they were.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you the 'Cultivators' of this worldline?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then the Great Dokkaebis answered.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>['Monarch Slayer', you must not interfere with the affairs of the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When the Great Dokkaebi 'Oksu' spoke, the Great Dokkaebi 'Onsae' next to him nodded.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[No one can go against the law of probability.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The last one to speak was the Great Dokkaebi 'Haesol'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This is not the world you lived in. No spiritual power and world power. It’s not the 《Tree OF imaginary》 that is dominated by settings and components.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"..."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Do you really not know what the beings who interfered with the events of another dimension are saying?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't know what they are talking about, but..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jaehwan glared at the dokkaebis surrounding him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The power of awakening was manifested once again in his eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Suspicion and Understanding. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With that power, he read the story of the 'Management Bureau' behind the dokkaebis, and noticed the existence of the 'Dokkaebi King' who controlled it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And he read the universe of this distant &lt;Star Stream&gt; where the Dokkaebi King served.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And what was at the end of that universe was...</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a tsususu sound, his power went out. There was something at the end of this world that even he, as of now, could not fully read.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jaehwan snickered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's interesting."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, he wondered how that Heo Yeogeon guy would navigate this universe. He became curious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jaehwan concentrated his strength on his right hand holding the sword once more.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The dokkaebi Noksu warned.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Wait, if you don’t stop right now—!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jaehwan thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps this was all part of that sly guy’s scheme. Although he didn’t like the feeling of falling for that trap, Jaehwan decided to let him fool him this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was because of the object that had come flying in with the message.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jaehwan quietly looked down at the dumpling he was holding in his left hand, then took a big bite. The moment he took the dumpling, he felt a surge of longing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Surely, what that guy said, 'I’ll make you go back'…'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, names came to mind. Chunghuh. Karlton. Ryunard. The names of people who had liked him but were no longer around. Jaehwan shook his head as if shaking off his thoughts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'That can’t be true.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">And he swung his sword forward with all his might.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In Jaehwan’s swordsmanship, a wave of destruction that tore through space rushed.</p>
