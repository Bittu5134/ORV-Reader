            <div class="orv_title"><h1>749 Episode 31 Yoo Jonghyuk (1)</h1></div>
「The universe suddenly began one day. No one knows what happened before that.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps that is why the &#39;Oldest Dream&#39; must continue to dream.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Lost guide</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The group members expressed their admiration as they saw Yoo Jonghyuk step forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps my companions also remembered &#39;that line&#39;. Yoo Jonghyuk said a similar line when he killed Poseidon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oooooh!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It sounds like something I’ve heard before.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As expected, it’s Yoo Jonghyuk.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I can’t believe the day has come when I hear that in person.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi, Kyung Sein, Killer King, Cha Yerin, and Ye Hyunwoo took turns spitting out a word and looking back at me at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No one opened their mouths, but I could tell what everyone was curious about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So is that real?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you think about it with common sense, there is no way he could have killed a great-grade constellation twice in just 41 rounds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So that&#39;s why they&#39;re asking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded slightly. That&#39;s real. Because this &#39;41st round&#39; is special.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oooh!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if she had received some sort of permission from my answer, Kyung Sein was excited and clapped her hands as she chanted his name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yoo Jonghyuk! Yoo Jonghyuk! Yoo Jonghyuk!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi also screamed in excitement.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King nodded and muttered quietly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Go, Supreme King.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Amid the noisy cheering, Yoo Jonghyuk glanced towards us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Seeing the line between his eyebrows, he must be in a bad mood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well, I think it would be burdensome if he suddenly received support like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, his eyes turned to me. Afterwards, an [electric sound] was heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—After I kill that guy, it’s your turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ugh, why?</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a memory that suddenly came to mind.</p>
「&quot;Eat, you bastard!&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Could it be because of being fed dirt?</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it&#39;s unfair.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I have never fed dirt to this guy. I just fed them the &#39;story of eating dirt&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy who was controlled by the story picked up the dirt and ate it himself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn, this is why I was hoping his memories would come back late.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, fortunately, it was a consolation to know that there was someone who would fall with me before me.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Tiger Eating Rice Cake&#39; is wary of the incarnation &#39;Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was an unexpected reaction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Under normal circumstances, this would have been an indignant moment, saying, &quot;You’re going to kill me when you&#39;re just an incarnation?&quot; or rushing in, shouting, &quot;You bastard, how dare you!&quot;</p>
[The constellation &#39;Tiger Eating Rice Cake&#39; glares at the incarnation &#39;Yoo Jonghyuk&#39; with a cautious expression.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He wasn&#39;t a &#39;reader&#39; anymore.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, being so wary of Yoo Jonghyuk means that the stories that control him are conscious of Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is a possibility that he may have read the &#39;reader’s&#39; memories.</p>
[Could you have become a transcendental being?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Transcendent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only mortal title that can fight against the immortal constellations in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, as I remember, Yoo Jonghyuk has not yet transcended. If he had &#39;transcended&#39;, a system message would have already appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I can defeat you even without transcendence.&quot;</p>
[A mortal who cannot even transcend would dare to face the constellations?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s right, you should come out like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging from the way he spoke, it seemed like the story &#39;old and sick guardian spirit&#39; was active again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The more he behaves like a stereotypical constellation, the more likely he is to lose.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Tiger Eating Rice Cake&#39; roars!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Tiger Eating Rice Cake&#39; is a great-grade constellation that utilizes some of the power of his true body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although he was somewhat limited by probability, he was a more powerful being than the demon marquis he fought earlier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So this time, Yoo Jonghyuk also has to do his best.</p>
[&#39;Redemption of Truth&#39; is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Without hesitation, Yoo Jonghyuk activated &#39;Story Imprint&#39;.</p>
[Part of incarnation Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s memories are sealed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Redemption of Truth is a &#39;story imprint&#39; that unleashes power at the cost of sealing some of the memories of the previous rounds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fragments of memories flowed into me as they were sealed before my eyes.</p>
「&quot;Leader.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That is Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s memory that was not written down in &#39;Ways of Survival&#39; or &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s 24th round.</p>
「&quot;I have a favor to ask, Captain.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The scenery of the wide sea shimmered and waves waved before my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was it a scenario played out on the coast? Yoo Jonghyuk and Shin Yoosoung were on the beach where the wreckage of broken ships washed up. The young girl had a large hole in her abdomen.</p>
「&quot;I want to go back to school someday.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A wound that cannot be healed by either the &#39;Spirit of Elaine Forest&#39; or the &#39;Great Hwandan&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The girl hid the wound with her hand and pretended not to notice the wound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung held her breath in Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s arms.</p>
「&quot;If this world ends safely—&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung also knows.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Schools will never reopen. Students will not return. She will never go to school.</p>
「&quot;Please come to the graduation ceremony.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even though she knew it all, Shin Yoosoung had no choice but to say that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though she knew very well what kind of eternity it would be remembered by Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk now answers that eternal question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I can’t go to your graduation ceremony, but—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">His 24th attempt failed. The world has been destroyed and past history will never return.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung of the 24th round did not graduate.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I won’t let you die before me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">His memories were being sealed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it were the Yoo Jonghyuk I knew, he would never have sealed it. However, the more important memories are sealed, the more powerful the &#39;Redemption of Truth&#39; is.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now, Yoo Jonghyuk needs a &#39;power&#39; that strong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stretched out my hand. I wanted to shout that those memories should not be sealed. If you forget that memory, the world will be as if it never happened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But at that moment, my eyes met with Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It may be an absurd leap.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There&#39;s no way Yoo Jonghyuk in the 41st round would think like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But now, Yoo Jonghyuk knew clearly that I was looking at his memories, and that I was the only one witnessing the memories he would lose.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I want you to remember this memory for me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I read and reread Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s memories being sealed with my fists clenched. I remembered the disappearing Shin Yoosoung and the 24th round without missing a single word.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I nodded, Yoo Jonghyuk turned his gaze.</p>
[All comprehensive abilities of incarnation &#39;Yoo Jonghyuk&#39; temporarily exceed the scenario limit standards!]</p></div>
[Explosive power surges from your entire body!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk took a leap forward with a tremendous energy. Magical power was overflowing from the guy&#39;s whole body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Quad deud deuk!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s rushing sword strike collided with the front paws of the &#39;Tiger Eating Rice Cake&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk lifted one seal from the Washington Dome and reached the same level as the &#39;Demon Marquis&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But this time, that level of force is not enough.</p>
[Just that much!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">While listening to the constellation&#39;s planned message, Yoo Jonghyuk immediately opened the second narrative engraving.</p>
[Incarnation &#39;Yoo Jonhhyuk&#39; activates &#39;Restraint of Emotions&#39;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Restraint of Emotions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#39;m nervous. This is because it reminded me of the &#39;black beast&#39; that turned Washington Dome into hell.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that time, there was the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, if Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s transformation into a beast progresses this time, who can stop him?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Do your part properly this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s voice reached my ears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A little belatedly, I remembered my promise with him. The reason he wanted to take me to the Washington scenario.</p>
「&quot;You stop it.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He trusted that I would get him back to normal when he had a problem.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’ll try.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A word I muttered without realizing it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King glanced in my direction. Fortunately, Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s transformation began before Killer King could even open his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I watched his transformation with bated breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will he become a &#39;black beast&#39; again this time, or...?</p>
[Incarnation &#39;Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;’s story engraving skill has increased significantly.]</p></div>
[&#39;Restraint of Emotions&#39; evolves!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With a dazzling beam of light, pitch-black hair covered Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s entire body. But this time he was not the &#39;black beast&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The pitch-black hair grew in an instant, followed by a fur coat reminiscent of the [Beast Lord&#39;s sensitivity] used by &#39;Beast Lord&#39; Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The difference is that Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s fur coat was black.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King, who was watching the scene from the side, widened his eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Long hair, fur coat… Could it be the Emperor of Heilang?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Normally, I would have retorted to Killer King&#39;s nonsense, but this time, I was so overwhelmed by Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s atmosphere that I couldn&#39;t think of anything else to say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wearing a black fur coat, Yoo Jonghyuk really looked like a prince of the demon world who reigned over ten thousand horses.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe that is another form of the &#39;black beast&#39;.</p>
[How—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">While the story of the &#39;old and sick guardian deity&#39; continued to lurk in secret, Yoo Jonghyuk’s new form moved.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s so fast that you can&#39;t even see it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even after learning [Way of the Wind], it was a speed that I couldn&#39;t follow with my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The astonished tiger screamed. However, neither the rushing spears nor the tiger&#39;s paws could catch Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No story in this world could redeem Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Pacheon kendo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A skill that has been trained and trained to reach its peak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a sense, the &#39;Recycling Center&#39; was his solo stage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All of his techniques have gone beyond the level of &#39;skill&#39;. In other words, it is not restricted by skill seals.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Pacheon yuseonggyeol.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A meteor blossomed in the swordplay of &#39;Sain Tragedy Sword&#39;. Stars cried out above every trace of the sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Gaaaaaagh!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ghosts hit by the meteor fragments disappeared into light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Truly overwhelming force.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The meteor shower pierced every part of the tiger’s body like a storm.</p>
[Kaaaaaa!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellation&#39;s scream spread throughout Zone 13.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Liverless Rabbit&#39; opens its eyes in astonishment!]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Rat spreading plague’ is scared.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Abyssal Black Flame Dragon&#39; holds his breath.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The slowly moving front paw of the tiger. Yoo Jonghyuk did not miss the short gap and fired back and forth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sword dug into the hole pierced by the meteor shower, connecting the holes like connecting constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With the sound of something breaking, the tiger&#39;s front paw flew through the air.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Reclining Dragon&#39; is overwhelmed by the power of the incarnation &#39;Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;The One Who Brought Ten Lambs&#39; cannot take their eyes off incarnation &#39;Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a thrill amidst the ecstatic tales scattered throughout.</p>
「A black wolf was hunting a tiger.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was no human feeling in the graceful movement of the sword. What was reflected in the trajectory was simply the time of hardship endured by Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Memories of training his sword day and night to defeat the constellations in the sky.</p>
[K, keaaaa—my arm! My arm—how dare you—!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">All those memories were concentrated and summed up in a single body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He narrowed the distance with the gait of [Zuzakshinbo], blocked incoming blows with [Defense Strength], and dealt with the oncoming spear ghosts with [Hundred Step God Fist].</p>
<p class="orv_line">And cut the constellation with [Pacheongeomdo].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Pacheongwangwangmu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dozens of sword lights pierced both legs of the tiger. One knee buckled, and then the other knee buckled again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The huge tiger&#39;s body lost its balance and fell forward. Yoo Jonghyuk didn&#39;t let go of the opportunity and flew towards the guy&#39;s neck.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was only on his eighth scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the eighth scenario, Yoo Jonghyuk was trying to accomplish the feat of dropping a constellation from the sky with his own strength.</p>
[The story &#39;Old and Sick Guardian Deity&#39; disappears.]</p></div>
[The story &#39;Rotten Dongajul&#39; is activated in exchange for the &#39;Old and Sick Guardian Deity&#39;!]</p></div>
「Rotten Dongajul.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The unique story of the &#39;Tiger Eating Rice Cake&#39; who escaped a desperate crisis.</p>
[The story &#39;Rotten Dongajul&#39; begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Although it was a similar technique to Nirvana&#39;s [No Possession], this story demanded a more terrible price than [No Possession].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just before Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s sword touched the guy&#39;s neck, a bright red fireball burst out from the tiger&#39;s chest along with the sound of fu-chem. Red snowflakes were scattered on the ground, creating a red sorghum field.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The image of the &#39;Tiger Eating Rice Cake&#39; began to disperse like smoke among the blood-stained sorghum fields.</p>
[I am dissatisfied. Since I was unable to get the little one—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The mantra of the &#39;Tiger Eating Rice Cake&#39; rang out as if he were sorrowful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His gaze full of hatred that had been on me soon turned to someone else.</p>
[I will take the other one.]</p></div>
