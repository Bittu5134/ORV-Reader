            <div class="orv_title"><h1>574 Episode 4. An Unwalked Road (2)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">In my dream, Kim Dokja called me Cheon Inho. However, when I listened carefully, it sounded like he was calling me Lee Hakhyun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, when I listened again.......</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 ⬛⬛⬛. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I'm not sure what he was saying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there he was, and I was standing next to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We were looking at a very large snowfield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A snowfield with letters floating on it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was so big, it seemed like no matter how much letters there was, they would never be able to cover it all.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 How long have you been here? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I may or may not have asked that question.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 A very long time. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know if that's what Kim Dokja said or not.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I stared at the snowfield for a while, I noticed something like footprints.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were human footprints.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if to test the waters, he gestured at me and started walking along the footprints.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I followed him too.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 This person must have really big feet. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">We walked, overlapping our footprints on top of each other. Occasionally, I'd take a wrong step and leave a footprint in the wrong place.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Ah. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja laughed, and I laughed, too.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 ⬛⬛⬛ is going to get angry. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I could almost hear him saying that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And I wonder how long we walked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know why, but the big footprints split into two directions. One big footprint kept moving forward, and the other big footprint started walking diagonally.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So were there two the persons leaving big footprints from the beginning?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't be sure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were all the same size.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I'm not sure why, but here the owners of the big footprints suddenly became two. So one walked straight ahead and the other walked diagonally.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at the path of the footprints in front of me, and then tried to follow them for a few steps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I must have taken a dozen steps.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 It stopped. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The footprints stopped here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Where had the owner of these footprints gone?</p>
<p class="orv_line">A strange thought occurred to me as I stared at the footprints.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps the owner of the footprints was still standing on them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned around, Kim Dokja was standing tall and looking in my direction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I waved at him and asked.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Can I keep walking this way? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked again.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I might make a mistake like I did before. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 It's okay. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I might make a mess of the snowfield. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 It doesn't matter. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Is it really okay?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to ask again, and again, and again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja smiled and said something. Unfortunately, I couldn't hear his last words.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I'll keep watching you. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It sounded like that.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi! Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">My whole body ached: the wound in my side throbbed and the pain in my broken left arm was excruciating.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You said you weren't going to sleep! It's already started!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uh, sorry."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I must have fallen asleep. I wondered why I had such a fairy tale-like dream,</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Pinocchio wasn't good during the operation either."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I guess it was because I heard about Pinocchio. Kim Dokja's last words still echoed in my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I looked around, the stomach was already pumping out digestive juices.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was spraying 'Mucus of the Hammer Seahorse' all over my head. My shoulders slumped as the sticky liquid trickled down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Stay still, you said it's safe to apply this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon smeared her own body with the Mucus of the Hammer Seahorse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Our plan was simple.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One, smear our entire bodies with mucus to resist the ichthyosaur's digestive juices.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Two, when the digestive juices start spewing, stick a 'Stone Hog's Pointed Thorn' into the openings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is the exact same tactic that Kim Dokja did in the original novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The difference is.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">"By the way, who's Kim Dokja?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You mentioned him in your sleep."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a moment, then opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's just a friend's name."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked, squeezing my mucus-covered head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then what about Ji Eunyoo?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did I say that name too?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. You asked me to save you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did I have a deadline in my dreams?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's the name of my editor."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Your editor?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it would be okay to be a little honest. I didn't know what Cheon Inho's real job was anyway. He was probably a swindler or something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I used to be a writer."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, it's better to be a writer than a swindler.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked in surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wow, a writer? What kind of books did you write?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That...... Do you know web novels?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Web novels? Is it like a webtoon?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That...... like Lord of the Rings......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, Lord of the Rings! I've seen the movies! Is that what you wrote?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, something similar......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know why my voice kept getting lower.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is asking you to speak up.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Easier said than done.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sighed lightly and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Would you mind not telling the others?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why? I think it's cool."</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is why you shouldn't introduce yourself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's start with that side first. Hold this and insert one on each opening."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Maybe because you're a writer you're good at changing the subject."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon grumbled, but stuck the thorns where I pointed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, the physicality of a main character was truly something else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were four openings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon stuck one thorn into each of the three openings, then closed them tightly to keep the digestive juices from flowing out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There's only one left."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's shove the rest of them into this one opening."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is that okay?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. It'll probably work better."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Stone Hog's Pointed Thorn' is an item that grows by sucking the fluids of sea species.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja had only used one thorn for each opening.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But in theory, the more thorns you put in an opening, the better.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The more thorns there are, the more thorns will grow at the same time, and the faster the ichthyosaur will fall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"One."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Digestive juices gurgled out of the thorn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The second thorn was inserted, and the ichthyosaur's stomach began to wriggle grotesquely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't so easy from the third thorn on. Jung Heewon frowned as she stuck the thorn into the hole again and again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"After the third one, it's a bit difficult, can you...... support me from the back?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'd love to, but my arms are like this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Support me with your back. Like this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stood with my back against Jung Heewon's back. Inhaling and exhaling, she pushed the thorn with all her might into the opening.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The part we were standing on shook for a moment, but the thorn went in just right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After taking a breath, Jung Heewon asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are we done?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. Now we just have to wait."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's really simple."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The job was done faster than I thought. In the main novel, Kim Dokja even practiced stabbing to get this done...... Why did he struggle so much anyway?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' admires your composure.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier says it's easy because it's a 'sea serpent'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">According to my calculations, the time it'll take to subdue the ichthyosaur is half a day to a day.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Considering the number of thorns it has, and the fact that it's smaller than the original, it could go down sooner than that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now it was just a matter of waiting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a sudden chill rush through me as I relaxed, probably because I was soaking wet from the river.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon looked at me wistfully as I shivered, then made an unexpected suggestion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Shall we stand back to back?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you don't mind, may we?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Please sit that way."</p>
<p class="orv_line">We meekly sat back to back. The warmth of Jung Heewon's body transmitted through my back, and I felt a little less cold.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"By the way, how did you come up with this method?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's just something that often appears in web novels."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You're a writer, I see."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As my back warmed up, I slowly dozed off.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wish I could use the 'Elaine Forest Essence' sold in the Dokkaebi Bag, but I couldn't right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Elaine Forest Essence recovers your body's wounds completely while you sleep.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't leave her alone without knowing what would happen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She kept talking to me as if she knew my condition.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Tell me something funny."</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was the most embarrassing moment of my life as a writer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, writers are not very funny people. None of the writers I know are funny.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, I managed to squeeze out some dry humor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"In my novel, there's a character named Jung Heewon."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"She looks really strong on the outside, but she's actually a fragile person. She doesn't shy away from fights because she's a very hard person, so she often breaks."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of the 'Jung Heewon' I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I had a question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Can I really say that the Jung Heewon I know is the Jung Heewon behind my back now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"She's good at physical work and have a quick mind. When she was in high school, she was confessed to by junior girls."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"She's bad at bearing public criticism, but she's good at kendo. She's been going to a kendo academy since she was a kid."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who had been listening until here, clapped her hands. She was genuinely impressed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's great, you almost got it all right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course I did. Most of it comes from the main novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But the last one is wrong, I never went to a kendo academy, I just went to kendo club at school."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know. I said that on purpose.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's a shame."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I went to the nationals, and I was elected district representative, but I quit."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Because of an injury."</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was a story I didn't know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">More accurately, it was a story I hadn't written.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Injury? Were you hurt badly?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was silent for a moment, and then, a beat too late, she answered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It hit me like a ton of bricks. There must be a story in this world that I didn't write.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly remembered that Jung Heewon's attribute was 'Crouching Figure'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How did she become a 'Crouching Figure'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Originally, 'Crouching Figure' is an attribute that is generated based on the strong mental shock of an incarnation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Jung Heewon was already a 'Crouching Figure' before she met the Cheoldoo Group.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi, how did you become a writer?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, I..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I naturally opened my mouth to speak, but I shut up again. An eerie sensation flickered across my chest.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 How did I become a writer? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly couldn't remember.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that the ichthyosaur's stomach wriggled ominously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly kept my balance and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I think it's about to start."</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no time for distractions now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fight was about to begin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ichthyosaur would go down first, or we would go down first?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took off the shirt I was wearing and used both sleeves to tie Jung Heewon's and my wrists together.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked anxiously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aren't you going to get cold? Ugh!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The floor vibrated sharply.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ichthyosaur was twisting its body in pain. The thorns had begun to dig into its body in earnest.</p>
