<p class="orv_line">In my dream, Kim Dokja called me Cheon Inho. However, when I listened carefully, it sounded</p>
<p class="orv_line">like he was calling me Lee Hakhyun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, when I listened again.......</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「⬛⬛⬛.」</div>「⬛⬛⬛.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#x27;m not sure what he was saying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there he was, and I was standing next to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We were looking at a very large snowfield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A snowfield with letters floating on it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was so big, it seemed like no matter how much letters there was, they would never be able to</p>
<p class="orv_line">cover it all.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「How long have you been here?」</div>「How long have you been here?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I may or may not have asked that question.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「A very long time.」</div>「A very long time.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what Kim Dokja said or not.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I stared at the snowfield for a while, I noticed something like footprints.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were human footprints.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if to test the waters, he gestured at me and started walking along the footprints.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I followed him too.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「This person must have really big feet.」</div>「This person must have really big feet.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">We walked, overlapping our footprints on top of each other. Occasionally, I&#x27;d take a wrong step</p>
<p class="orv_line">and leave a footprint in the wrong place.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Ah.」</div>「Ah.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja laughed, and I laughed, too.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「⬛⬛⬛ is going to get angry.」</div>「⬛⬛⬛ is going to get angry.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could almost hear him saying that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And I wonder how long we walked.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know why, but the big footprints split into two directions. One big footprint kept moving</p>
<p class="orv_line">forward, and the other big footprint started walking diagonally.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So were there two the persons leaving big footprints from the beginning?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#x27;t be sure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were all the same size.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#x27;m not sure why, but here the owners of the big footprints suddenly became two. So one walked</p>
<p class="orv_line">straight ahead and the other walked diagonally.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at the path of the footprints in front of me, and then tried to follow them for a few steps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I must have taken a dozen steps.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「It stopped.」</div>「It stopped.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The footprints stopped here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Where had the owner of these footprints gone?</p>
<p class="orv_line">A strange thought occurred to me as I stared at the footprints.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps the owner of the footprints was still standing on them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned around, Kim Dokja was standing tall and looking in my direction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I waved at him and asked.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Can I keep walking this way?」</div>「Can I keep walking this way?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked again.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I might make a mistake like I did before.」</div>「I might make a mistake like I did before.」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「It&#x27;s okay.」</div>「It's okay.」</p>

<div class="orv_quote"><p>「It doesn&#x27;t matter.」</div>「It doesn't matter.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it really okay?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to ask again, and again, and again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja smiled and said something. Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t hear his last words.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I&#x27;ll keep watching you.」</div>「I'll keep watching you.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">It sounded like that.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi! Inho-ssi!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">My whole body ached: the wound in my side throbbed and the pain in my broken left arm was</p>
<p class="orv_line">excruciating.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You said you weren&#x27;t going to sleep! It&#x27;s already started!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Uh, sorry.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I must have fallen asleep. I wondered why I had such a fairy tale-like dream,</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Pinocchio wasn&#x27;t good during the operation either.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I guess it was because I heard about Pinocchio. Kim Dokja&#x27;s last words still echoed in my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I looked around, the stomach was already pumping out digestive juices.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was spraying &#x27;Mucus of the Hammer Seahorse&#x27; all over my head. My shoulders</p>
<p class="orv_line">slumped as the sticky liquid trickled down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Stay still, you said it&#x27;s safe to apply this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon smeared her own body with the Mucus of the Hammer Seahorse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Our plan was simple.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One, smear our entire bodies with mucus to resist the ichthyosaur&#x27;s digestive juices.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Two, when the digestive juices start spewing, stick a &#x27;Stone Hog&#x27;s Pointed Thorn&#x27; into the</p>
<p class="orv_line">openings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is the exact same tactic that Kim Dokja did in the original novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The difference is.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;By the way, who&#x27;s Kim Dokja?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You mentioned him in your sleep.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a moment, then opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s just a friend&#x27;s name.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked, squeezing my mucus-covered head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then what about Ji Eunyoo?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did I say that name too?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. You asked me to save you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did I have a deadline in my dreams?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s the name of my editor.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Your editor?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it would be okay to be a little honest. I didn&#x27;t know what Cheon Inho&#x27;s real job was</p>
<p class="orv_line">anyway. He was probably a swindler or something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I used to be a writer.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Still, it&#x27;s better to be a writer than a swindler.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked in surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow, a writer? What kind of books did you write?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That...... Do you know web novels?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Web novels? Is it like a webtoon?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That...... like Lord of the Rings.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, Lord of the Rings! I&#x27;ve seen the movies! Is that what you wrote?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, something similar.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know why my voice kept getting lower.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation who hasn&#x27;t revealed their modifier is asking you to speak up.]</div>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is asking you to speak up.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Easier said than done.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sighed lightly and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Would you mind not telling the others?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why? I think it&#x27;s cool.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is why you shouldn&#x27;t introduce yourself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s start with that side first. Hold this and insert one on each opening.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe because you&#x27;re a writer you&#x27;re good at changing the subject.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon grumbled, but stuck the thorns where I pointed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, the physicality of a main character was truly something else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were four openings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon stuck one thorn into each of the three openings, then closed them tightly to keep</p>
<p class="orv_line">the digestive juices from flowing out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There&#x27;s only one left.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s shove the rest of them into this one opening.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is that okay?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. It&#x27;ll probably work better.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#x27;Stone Hog&#x27;s Pointed Thorn&#x27; is an item that grows by sucking the fluids of sea species.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja had only used one thorn for each opening.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But in theory, the more thorns you put in an opening, the better.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The more thorns there are, the more thorns will grow at the same time, and the faster the</p>
<p class="orv_line">ichthyosaur will fall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;One.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Digestive juices gurgled out of the thorn.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The second thorn was inserted, and the ichthyosaur&#x27;s stomach began to wriggle grotesquely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#x27;t so easy from the third thorn on. Jung Heewon frowned as she stuck the thorn into the</p>
<p class="orv_line">hole again and again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;After the third one, it&#x27;s a bit difficult, can you...... support me from the back?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;d love to, but my arms are like this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Support me with your back. Like this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stood with my back against Jung Heewon&#x27;s back. Inhaling and exhaling, she pushed the thorn</p>
<p class="orv_line">with all her might into the opening.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The part we were standing on shook for a moment, but the thorn went in just right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After taking a breath, Jung Heewon asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are we done?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. Now we just have to wait.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s really simple.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The job was done faster than I thought. In the main novel, Kim Dokja even practiced stabbing to</p>
<p class="orv_line">get this done...... Why did he struggle so much anyway?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Sneaking Schemer&#x27; admires your composure.]</div>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' admires your composure.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation who hasn&#x27;t revealed their modifier says it&#x27;s easy because it&#x27;s a &#x27;sea serpent&#x27;.]</div>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier says it's easy because it's a 'sea serpent'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to my calculations, the time it&#x27;ll take to subdue the ichthyosaur is half a day to a day.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Considering the number of thorns it has, and the fact that it&#x27;s smaller than the original, it could go</p>
<p class="orv_line">down sooner than that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now it was just a matter of waiting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a sudden chill rush through me as I relaxed, probably because I was soaking wet from the</p>
<p class="orv_line">river.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon looked at me wistfully as I shivered, then made an unexpected suggestion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Shall we stand back to back?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you don&#x27;t mind, may we?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Please sit that way.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We meekly sat back to back. The warmth of Jung Heewon&#x27;s body transmitted through my back,</p>
<p class="orv_line">and I felt a little less cold.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;By the way, how did you come up with this method?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s just something that often appears in web novels.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;re a writer, I see.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As my back warmed up, I slowly dozed off.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I wish I could use the &#x27;Elaine Forest Essence&#x27; sold in the Dokkaebi Bag, but I couldn&#x27;t right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Elaine Forest Essence recovers your body&#x27;s wounds completely while you sleep.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#x27;t leave her alone without knowing what would happen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She kept talking to me as if she knew my condition.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Tell me something funny.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was the most embarrassing moment of my life as a writer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, writers are not very funny people. None of the writers I know are funny.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, I managed to squeeze out some dry humor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;In my novel, there&#x27;s a character named Jung Heewon.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;She looks really strong on the outside, but she&#x27;s actually a fragile person. She doesn&#x27;t shy away</p>
<p class="orv_line">from fights because she&#x27;s a very hard person, so she often breaks.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of the &#x27;Jung Heewon&#x27; I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I had a question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Can I really say that the Jung Heewon I know is the Jung Heewon behind my back now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;She&#x27;s good at physical work and have a quick mind. When she was in high school, she was</p>
<p class="orv_line">confessed to by junior girls.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;She&#x27;s bad at bearing public criticism, but she&#x27;s good at kendo. She&#x27;s been going to a kendo</p>
<p class="orv_line">academy since she was a kid.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who had been listening until here, clapped her hands. She was genuinely</p>
<p class="orv_line">impressed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s great, you almost got it all right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course I did. Most of it comes from the main novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But the last one is wrong, I never went to a kendo academy, I just went to kendo club at school.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know. I said that on purpose.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s a shame.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I went to the nationals, and I was elected district representative, but I quit.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because of an injury.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was a story I didn&#x27;t know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">More accurately, it was a story I hadn&#x27;t written.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Injury? Were you hurt badly?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was silent for a moment, and then, a beat too late, she answered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It hit me like a ton of bricks. There must be a story in this world that I didn&#x27;t write.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly remembered that Jung Heewon&#x27;s attribute was &#x27;Crouching Figure&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How did she become a &#x27;Crouching Figure&#x27;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Originally, &#x27;Crouching Figure&#x27; is an attribute that is generated based on the strong mental shock</p>
<p class="orv_line">of an incarnation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Jung Heewon was already a &#x27;Crouching Figure&#x27; before she met the Cheoldoo Group.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi, how did you become a writer?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, I...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I naturally opened my mouth to speak, but I shut up again. An eerie sensation flickered across</p>
<p class="orv_line">my chest.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「How did I become a writer?」</div>「How did I become a writer?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly couldn&#x27;t remember.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that the ichthyosaur&#x27;s stomach wriggled ominously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly kept my balance and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think it&#x27;s about to start.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no time for distractions now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fight was about to begin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ichthyosaur would go down first, or we would go down first?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took off the shirt I was wearing and used both sleeves to tie Jung Heewon&#x27;s and my wrists</p>
<p class="orv_line">together.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked anxiously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aren&#x27;t you going to get cold? Ugh!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The floor vibrated sharply.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ichthyosaur was twisting its body in pain. The thorns had begun to dig into its body in</p>
<p class="orv_line">earnest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Author&#x27;s Note</p>
<p class="orv_line">Meanwhile, there is more.</p>
