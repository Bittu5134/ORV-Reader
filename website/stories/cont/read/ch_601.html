<p class="orv_line">I looked around the theater.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were seventeen people waiting on the first floor of the basement.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first glance, they were not ordinary people.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Someone has used 'Sneak Peek' on you!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Someone has used 'Attribute Detection' on you!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Detection skill messages flew in as if they'd been waiting for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They weren't as high-level detection skills as Yoo Joonghyuk's [Sage's Eye], but they weren't</p>
<p class="orv_line">easy to get at this early stage. Readers, too, are out of the ordinary.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Sneak Peek' failed for an unknown reason!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Attribute Detection' failed for an unknown reason!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, they didn't work on me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know why it didn't work on me. Come to think of it, I can't even see my own 'Attribute</p>
<p class="orv_line">Window', so it would be odd if they can see it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe I do have a [Fourth Wall] after all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Fourth Wall.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">I called out inside, but there was no response.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I'm strong-minded, so maybe I just blocked them with my mind?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ugh."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, I noticed those who were affected by the rebound of the skill. There were two people</p>
<p class="orv_line">who had a strange reaction.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">One was an old man leaning against a stall with a pipe in his mouth, and the other was a woman</p>
<p class="orv_line">with a long cheolgon[3] on her back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps they were the ones who had just used the detection skills.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly checked their information using the [Readers' Comments List].</p>

<p>The old man is 0.06 of Killer King.</p>
<p>The woman is 0.08 of Killer King.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Somehow, I ended up evaluating all readers based on Killer King.</p>
<p>I looked at the other readers one by one.</p>
<p>The man standing over there is 0.005 of Killer King, the one next to him is 0.001 of Killer King,</p>
<p>the other next to them is 0.0006 of Killer King...... There were quite a few people who didn't</p>
<p>finish the novel.</p>
<p>Other than that, I didn't see anyone with a particularly impressive number of reads.</p>
<p>Everyone's working hard.</p>
<p>"Isn't that Lee Jihye?"</p>
<p>Someone muttered in a low voice.</p>
<p>I looked back at Lee Jihye with a sense of regret.</p>
<p>Lee Jihye couldn't help but stand out, even if they didn't know anyone else. She was described in</p>
<p>a novel.</p>
<p>A hood zipped-up and a ponytail. She carried a long sword. Plus, she has a cute face, so they</p>
<p>couldn't help but notice.</p>
<p>"Hmm?"</p>
<p>Lee Jihye glared in the direction of the sound, and people quickly averted their eyes.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein whispered to me.</p>
<p>"Do you want me to try talking to them?"</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein is a friendly person, so he wouldn't have a problem getting to know them, but.......</p>
<p>"We'd better be a little cautious here."</p>
<p>So far, I've been lucky. Kyung Sein, Dansoo ahjussi and Ye Hyunwoo. They've all been good</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>But Killer King's advice is right. As he said, there was no guarantee that every reader would be a</p>
<p>good person.</p>
<p><!>[Oh, that's a lot of people now.]</p>
<p>The theater doors at the back slammed shut, and the voice of a dokkaebi called out from the air.</p>
<p></p>
<p>the first floor.]</p>
<p>'Theater Dungeon' is a hidden scenario.</p>
<p>Originally, the dokkaebi wouldn't intervene.</p>
<p>"There are more people upstairs. We should be careful."</p>
<p>At Dansoo ahjussi's words, we exchanged a quick glance and went up to the first floor.</p>
<p>As we entered the lobby, the first thing we saw was a dokkaebi in a suit.</p>
<p><!>[Welcome. My name is Paul, I'm an intermediate goblin.]</p>
<p>The intermediate dokkaebi Paul.</p>
<p>He appeared in the Omniscient Reader. Messing up the 'Disaster of the Floods' scenario, getting</p>
<p>beaten up by Kim Dokja, and being exiled.</p>
<p>It felt strange to run into him in the 41st turn.</p>
<p>anymore.]</p>
<p>By now, there were at least 40 people in the lobby on the first floor.</p>
<p>already pretty far upstairs.]</p>
<p>A screen floated up on the lobby ceiling.</p>
<p>The screen showed the other incarnations attacking the upper levels of the theater dungeon.</p>
<p>—What the hell, it's no big deal, right?</p>
<p>A young man chuckling and slashing at zombies in the movie, his hair dyed white and a tattered</p>
<p>school uniform. A dark aura wrapped around a sharp knife.</p>
<p>I realized who he was.</p>
<p><&>「Kim Namwoon.」</p>
<p>I wasn't the only one who recognized him. Some people covered their mouths to hide their</p>
<p>surprise, others widened their eyes.</p>
<p>—Hey, soldier, hurry up and follow me. I'll go up before the captain. If you delay me.......</p>
<p>The 41st turn Kim Namwoon was still Kim Namwoon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I could see some readers smiling faintly. Others stiffened their expressions.</p>
<p>Both reactions were understandable.</p>
<p>That 'Kim Namwoon' was definitely the Kim Namwoon we know, and therefore a Kim</p>
<p>Namwoon that was extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>—Namwoon-ssi. This stage is not just about killing zombies.......</p>
<p>I could tell even though it was just a voice.</p>
<p>It was the unmistakable Lee Hyunsung.</p>
<p>The readers' expressions changed one by one. They could finally meet another member of the</p>
<p>Kim Dokja's Company.</p>
<p>It was then that Kim Namwoon's scream rang out.</p>
<p>—Uaaaak! What!</p>
<p>The screen shook ominously.</p>
<p>A sharp series of squeals.</p>
<p>A white coat fluttering lightly at the end of the screen.</p>
<p>Immediately, the broadcast stopped.</p>
<p><!>[That's it for the preview.]</p>
<p>Paul laughed in amusement. There was a mild commotion in the lobby.</p>
<p>"Was that...... right?"</p>
<p>"As expected, yes. As long as you manage to get up there somehow......."</p>
<p>"It's a little different from the original development."</p>
<p>I could see where they were coming from.</p>
<p>The 'white coat' is too symbolic an item in Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi. That's Kim Dokja, right?"</p>
<p>Kyung Sein whispered. Her[1] eyes shook with anticipation.</p>
<p><&>「There might be a Kim Dokja somewhere in this world.」</p>
<p>I can understand that. I don't think there's a reader here who doesn't expect that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I steeled myself and said.</p>
<p>"This is the 41st turn."</p>
<p>"Well, but what if something happens that we don't know about, and there's a Kim Dokja here—"</p>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>I replied, fiddling with the lemon candy in my pocket.</p>
<p>"And even if he came here like we did, it's not time to get the coat yet, you know."</p>
<p>"Ah. That's right, the Infinite Dimension Space Coat is......."</p>
<p>Kyung Sein's expression turned sour.</p>
<p>"Then who was that person just now?"</p>
<p>"We'll find out when we go up there."</p>
<p>Lee Jihye, who was looking up at the screen from the side, chimed in.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi. Let's go quickly. I don't want to lose to that guy."</p>
<p>I wondered who 'that guy' was and asked.</p>
<p>"Kim Namwoon?"</p>
<p>"What. How do you know his name?"</p>
<p>"He looks like that."</p>
<p>"No, what—"</p>
<p>I looked at Paul, the intermediate dokkaebi.</p>
<p>He had to show the video of the upper floors at this time.</p>
<p>And he's adding psychological pressure by emphasizing that we're 'late'. Normally, this would</p>
<p>have been an unnecessary performance.</p>
<p>That said.</p>
<p>upper floors.]</p>
<p>Maybe there's a new scenario I'm not aware of.</p>
<p><!>[That's why I've organized an event specifically for the latecomers.]</p>
<p></p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' wonders what that is.]</p>
<p><!>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is curious.]</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' worries about the incarnations.]</p>
<p>From the looks of it, I can guess what he's trying to do.</p>
<p>That damned intermediate-grade dokkaebi had started playing games with the owner of this</p>
<p>'Theater Dungeon'.</p>
<p><!>[Read the scenario description for yourself for more details.]</p>
<p><!>[A new sub scenario has arrived!]</p>
<p></p>
</div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line"><Sub Scenario — Departure of the Cinema Trip></p>
<p class="orv_line">Category : Sub</p>
<p class="orv_line">Difficulty: B</p>
<p class="orv_line">Clear Conditions: The staircase of the 'Cinema Trip' will open in the Theater Dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">You can use the 'Cinema Trip' to quickly catch up to the starters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Roll the dice, clear the stages, and complete the 'Theater Dungeon' faster than the starters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Time Limit: —</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reward: ???</p>
<p class="orv_line">Failure: —</p>
<br>
<div class="orv_window">
<p></p>
<p>* You can team up with up to 3 players to start your 'Cinema Trip'.</p>
<p>*From the 1st floor to the 8th floor, every 'staircase' you can step on hides a [Normal Stage],</p>
<p></p>
<p>* Each stage has a certain probability of a mission associated with a specific 'movie', and</p>
<p>completing that mission awards a 'dice'.</p>
<p>* You can climb stairs equal to the number of eyes rolled on the 'dice'.</p>
<p></p>
</div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I roughly understood the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So, it's a kind of movie version of a 'board game'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We're the pieces of the board game in groups of three, and we roll the dice, and if we get a high</p>
<p class="orv_line">number, we go up the stairs. If you get stuck on a stage, you have to complete a mission.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this is a scenario where you're trying to catch up to the upper incarnations, the stages will be</p>
<p class="orv_line">much shorter than the movie.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's like Bl⬛Mar[2], right? Ugh, the filtering."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Both Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi seemed to have figured out what the game was about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So did other readers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, there's no one in Korea who doesn't know this game.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I'll give you 10 minutes to form teams.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations looked at each other in unison.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Those who already had teams seemed intent on participating as they were, while others looked</p>
<p class="orv_line">around frantically.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The two next to you. They're Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye, right?</p>
<p class="orv_line">A voice in my ear made me look around.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Full Voice.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't realize that someone had already bought the skill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Don't look around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A high-pressure tone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I scanned the area out of the corner of my eye.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">[Full Voice] is a skill that seals sound with magic and transmits it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The user of this skill couldn't help but move their lips.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I don't know how you got the S-grade characters already, but come join our group. There are</p>
<p class="orv_line">three of us. Some of us have contracts with narrative-grade constellations, and some of us have</p>
<p class="orv_line">S-grade items.</p>
<p class="orv_line">S-grade items and narrative-grades constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not a bad offer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If only it hadn't been for the words that followed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You, Lee Jihye and Jung Heewon. I'll take up to three. We can split into two teams and go up</p>
<p class="orv_line">together.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It didn't take me long to find the user of [Full Voice], the woman with the cheolgon on her back</p>
<p class="orv_line">who had used [Attribute Detection] on me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Please think about it and answer quickly. Remember, this is real life, not fiction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nickname strawberry1137.</p>
<p class="orv_line">8 reads.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know how she could be so confident after reading Omniscient Reader 8 times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But then I heard another [Full Voice].</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Do you want to team up?</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time, it was the old man. I could tell just by looking at him. He was the only one mumbling</p>
<p class="orv_line">as if he were ventriloquizing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nickname barampoong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">6 reads.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—There are two of us. We're fewer in number, but as you can see, I have [Full Voice] and one Sgrade skill. I think you're five...... Why don't you join forces with us?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Again, not a bad offer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, there was already a behind-the-scenes war of nerves, they were meticulous people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, they weren't the only readers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Excuse me......."</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">He raised his hand cautiously, he wore a faded sweatshirt and clutched a toothless sword. He</p>
<p class="orv_line">looked around, wondering how he'd gotten here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He glanced around and asked the innocent question I wished he hadn't.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"H-has anyone read Omniscient Reader?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a collective sigh of despondency. Judging by the looks on people's faces, he was</p>
<p class="orv_line">going to have a hard time finding teammates. It was then that a group of people walked out from</p>
<p class="orv_line">the stalls in the back of the lobby.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you all shaking about? I don't think there's anyone here who hasn't read the novel."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A group of five men and women.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were the ones I hadn't yet used [Readers' Comments List] on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man who seemed to be the leader of the group spoke up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's not a good time to be looking at each other like that."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Several of us gasped at the man's attire.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A white coat and long sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Obviously, he wasn't Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We're not here to fight amongst ourselves, are we? Isn't the purpose to work together to clear</p>
<p class="orv_line">the dungeon? I'm sure you all received the scenario at the Banquet."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He used his deep voice to dominate the room. He was a good talker.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't think you're all planning on getting blown to bits. Have you forgotten what kind of world</p>
<p class="orv_line">this is?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The mood turned sour, and the cheolgon woman, who had been listening silently, asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you up to?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You mean me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man smirked, as if he were Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm closer to being a 'Kim Dokja' than anyone else in the world right now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The cheolgon woman smirked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You?"</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you that confident?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Indeed, the cheolgon woman, who had read Omniscient Reader 8 times, arrogantly drew out her</p>
<p class="orv_line">cheolgon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then the man laughed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm not just talking about skill."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He drew the sword at his waist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel Kyung Sein beside me breathing in. Perhaps anyone would have.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A sword broken in half.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A keen reader would recognize the item.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Broken Faith......!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a commotion in the hall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The cheolgon woman narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You think a broken sword is enough to make you Kim Dokja—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wuuuuh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A blue-white glow emanated from the man's sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An ether blade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone cried out in surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"P-Purest Sword Force?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's the Purest Sword Force!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">For once, the cheolgon woman's expression stiffened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man smiled faintly at her, then slowly turned around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's understandable that you're so frightened. But you don't have to worry."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"W-who are you. You're not even the real Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Of course I'm not Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man laughed, looking a little sad.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">"Probably even 'Kim Dokja' wouldn't know more about this world than I do?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man, who had overwhelmed everyone in the room with his performance, casually revealed</p>
<p class="orv_line">his identity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm the one who wrote 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』."</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Author's Note</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's not us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">+) Readers, we're really sorry. Due to our scheduling mistake, the upload of the series on Munpia</p>
<p class="orv_line">was late. ᅮᅮ We will be careful not to do this next time.</p>
