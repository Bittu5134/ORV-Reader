            <div class="orv_title"><h1>709 Episode 26 Star Ladder (5)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">As the chatter of &lt;Asgard&gt; subsided, the sky over Ginnungagap was covered in silence again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A sky where no star dares to shine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was not simply because the veil of 'Ginnungagap' hid the starlight. Beyond that veil, there was a being that caught the light of all the stars.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja burst into laughter under his breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Look, you can’t do that."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The great constellations remained silent, unable to respond to those words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They probably felt it too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just now, a constellation from &lt;Asgard&gt; fell from beyond the sky of 'Ginnungagap'. I don't know what the constellation's modifier or true name is. However, judging from the reactions of the great constellations, it seems that he is not a weak guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That constellation fell all at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Is Yoo Jonghyuk over there?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja looked up at the sky without answering.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What Kim Dokja can see, I can also see. However, Yoo Jonghyuk was not visible in Kim Dokja's eyes. All that was reflected in my eyes was a landscape that looked like a pitch-black blackout curtain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—There is.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, we could imagine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fragments recovered by Kim Dokja were talking to us.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Kim Dokja. Are you there?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a voice from the distant past.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Words that his colleagues once searched for him with.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Dokja-ssi." 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Ahjussi! Can you hear me? Ahjussi!" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Since this world line did not allow communication with them, their voices were nothing more than auditory hallucinations created by Kim Dokja's memories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, we knew. Even if the voice is different, even if the pitch and content of the words are different, &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; is looking for Kim Dokja beyond the stage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because this is 'that kind of story'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—In the end, all that remains is the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This story is all about Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Do you miss them?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">The agitation felt like a faint ripple and then subsided.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I told you. That's not my responsibility.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly my emotions soared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to tell the Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">You don't have to be that kind of person. There is no reason why you have to be the only 'Kim Dokja' like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But on the other hand, I understood what he was saying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His story was telling.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 This is the way of the 'Demon King of Salvation'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He can only say that. From the time he was born, he had no choice but to live like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just like that stubborn Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, this thought occurred to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If every 'Kim Dokja' had his own role. If you live a story appropriate for that role.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So what is my role as 'Kim Dokja'?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Kim Nonggaf' will be lifted soon.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The pitch-black sky was shaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first thing that came to me was relief that I had survived.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When this 'stage' is lifted, the constellations will no longer be able to harm us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it was a scenario where the scale of probability was at play, even if the opponent was &lt;Asgard&gt;, one of the three powers of the 'Nebula', there was no way they could have suffered a bigger loss than this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the great constellations showed no sign of giving up yet.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Don’t bluff. No great being can cross that veil now.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Valkyrie's daughter was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order for the Yoo Jonghyuk I know to descend here, at least a mythical constellation would have to appear and balance the scales.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there is no way that 'Odin' would appear here just to catch us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That means the constellations can’t come to help you."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There is no need for help from other constellations. Because we alone are enough to hunt you down.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"The three of them were torn apart earlier."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At those words, a bright roar flowed from 'Valkyrie's Daughter', who inherited the status of the seven great constellations.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I know what the 'old you' looked like.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The old Kim Dokja?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I have seen it several times in the stories of the mythical constellations that hunted you. It was so fascinating that I couldn't help but watch it over and over again. In that story, you were truly beautiful.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I was wondering.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is Kim Dokja's true identity really as they claim?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it remains as a 'story', there is no guarantee that the incident was true.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In some stories, the facts are contaminated by false propaganda.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Valkyrie’s Daughter' continued speaking in a cold voice.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are imitating God well despite the skin that God has shed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Those words struck my heart in a strange way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Imitate."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation laughed without denying those words in any way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The air around us began to vibrate. Seven constellations, led by 'Valkyrie's Daughter', were approaching with all their might.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Ginnungagap' is not over yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'What are you going to do?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Three constellations have already left. The remaining great constellations will now risk their life to attack.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'If I use that skill one more time—'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Then you’ll die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know. But there is no other way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—There is a way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Valkyrie's Daughter' flew into the air and threw out a spear, spewing out chills. A fierce gust of wind struck my waist as if the space around me was being compressed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's enormous.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it is not a mythical-grade attack, if it is an attack of this level, one hit will kill me instantly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in that situation, Kim Dokja was still smirking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Seven of you attack someone with nothing but fault? If we do this, we’ll have no choice but to call our side."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There is no one on your side here—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja put his hand into his chest and threw something toward the front.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Acrid smoke spread out with a small explosion sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Poison bomb.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a trophy obtained when dealing with the Misreading association guys in the Star Labyrinth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Naturally, it was an item that would not cause any harm to the constellations.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[With just this insignificant skill!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Miscellaneous skill?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations, startled by Kim Dokja's words, stopped for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, instead of running straight this way, they started creating wind pressure to blow away the smoke from the poisonous bomb.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They suspected that Kim Dokja might have set a trap.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that was exactly the effect Kim Dokja was aiming for.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Anna Croft."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, who was standing in the back, trembled at Kim Dokja's call.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja said, reaching out his hand toward her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heart."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The processing of the 'Lesser Dragon’s Heart' that I requested earlier has just been completed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Valkyrie's daughter, who witnessed the scene, warned.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Prophet! What are you trying to do now!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft's movements stopped at the bloody voice.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I'm sure you're not trying to betray &lt;Asgard&gt;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At those words, both Anna Croft, Selena Kim, and Christina Page who were by her side turned pale.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Have you forgotten whose incarnation you are?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The reason 'Zarathustra' was able to become as strong as it is now is because of the support of the nebula &lt;Asgard&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Helping me in a situation where I and &lt;Asgard&gt; were at a loss was tantamount to betraying the Nebula behind her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft's 'Eye of the Great Evil' was seen turning red for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft stumbled, frowning as sparks flew through the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She attempted to read the future with [Future Sight]. Judging by the expression on his face, [Future Sight] probably failed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, who looked at us for a moment, lowered her head and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am definitely the incarnation of &lt;Asgard&gt;."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I understood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the seventh scenario, it was obvious what the price would be for betraying the third-tier giant Nebula.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If she helps us now, Anna's group will be defeated. So her judgment now was extremely reasonable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft slowly raised her head, looked at 'Valkyrie's Daughter' and continued her words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m not sure if you can represent &lt;Asgard&gt;."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I looked into Anna Croft's eyes, I slowly got goosebumps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I forgot for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That she is a 'gambler in Las Vegas'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[What are you saying now?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"This stage is from the beginning, 'Ginnungagap', what happened here is not recorded. Since it is not handed down, no one outside can know what happened here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft has just placed a bet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you all die here, who will remember what I did?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[What nonsense are you talking about, prophet!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A gamble with little chance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A situation in which a normal 'Anna Croft' would never have intervened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And yet now, Anna Croft has placed her entire stake on the conman she hates the most.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Cheon Inho. Can you do it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don’t know if Cheon Inho can do it or not. However, it was not Cheon Inho who was answering now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It is possible."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations realized something was wrong and shouted.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Attack!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the meantime, we received the 'Refined Lesser Dragon Heart' from Anna Croft.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to ask her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did you decide to help us?</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a situation where there is no future in sight, what on earth did you believe and bet on us?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"In no round was I recognized as a 'companion' by the Supreme King."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft's gaze was focused on the fallen Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If such a powerful king recognized you as a comrade, there must be a good reason."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft had a feeling that this round was the end of the world lines. Therefore, she may also have taken her last gamble.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Jonghyuk has an eye for people."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations that cleared away the poisonous fog each fired their weapons.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The one that flew first was again the spear fired by 'Valkyrie’s Daughter'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The thunderous strike contained in the weapon flew over, turning the entire floor over.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Kill! Recover the fragments!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja dodged the spear  and immediately swallowed the 'lesser dragon’s heart'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Use 'Refined Lesser Dragon’s Heart'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My heart was beating loudly and my body was shaking violently. The magical power emanating from the dragon's heart was merging with my heart. Like the fable of a chrysalis becoming a butterfly, I felt my body breaking through its limits.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your body evolves!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story of the 'Braqui Clan' dwells in your heart.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But the opponents were constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was not possible to overcome the defense just by absorbing a single 'lesser dragon's heart' and increasing the amount of magical power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The weapon that had passed us was flying back to us across the distant sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Considering that the range of the lightning discharged was larger than before, it seemed difficult to avoid it by fluke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time we have to hit with all our might.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Youngest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Yes.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment my heart beat loudly, the dragon's heart carried rough magical energy throughout my body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I felt pain due to torn blood vessels, pages started turning in my head.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">We are Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Readers fight in their own way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The person we need right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'It's a monster that can take on seven great-grade constellations.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It’s hard to do just that. The physical size doesn't match, so the cost of class is too high.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'It won't work even with a broken sword.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">A character who can defeat seven great constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were many people that came to mind, but it was hard to think of anyone who could take them down without unduly harming the balance of the scales.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—There is one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But will it work? That person is a 'constellation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Originally, [Bookmark] only works on 'characters'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, in the Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint, Kim Dokja never once borrowed the power of 'constellations' as a bookmark.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Maybe, because I happened to get the 'Dragon Heart' too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it wasn't impossible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was definitely an increase in understanding of bookmarks for 'constellations'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Then let's do it.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">An existence that is at the limit that my current body can handle and that the probability of the scale allows.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "This guy was born to be a businessman." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As the pages stopped turning, his history filled my ears.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I was born with the blood of a dragon." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the main story, there was no opportunity to borrow his power as a 'bookmark'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because there was insufficient understanding.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You possess the 'Dragon Heart'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your body specifications are similar to the person's body specifications.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But what about now?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Bookmark number 21 is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My heart was pounding loudly and my vision was distorted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The rushing constellations shouted as if they were struggling.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I don’t know what you’re trying to do—]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Kill him! At best, he can only use the power of a great-grade!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At best, he is a great-grade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, even great-grade have a hierarchy.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Three Swords Lv. ???' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He is the most powerful constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is a being who has never swung his sword at the same opponent more than three times in his life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A warrior who cut down a thousand people with one sword, collapsed a mountain with two swords, and split the sea with three swords.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Bookmark number 21 'Goryeo First Sword Cheok Jungyeong' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellation at the rear, who belatedly realized something, shouted.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Wait, stop! Valkyrie's daughter! Something is wrong! Now he is—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Before he could even finish his words, the entire landscape in front of him was torn apart.</p>
