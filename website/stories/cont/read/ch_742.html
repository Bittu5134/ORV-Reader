            <div class="orv_title"><h1>742 Episode 30 Zodiac (4)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Spots of blood and thin cuts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A few hairs fluttered and fell to the floor due to Ye Hyunwoo's wind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at the hair and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If it is reasonable for someone who has nothing more to lose to become 'Kim Dokja', then it is not right for Hyunwoo to become Kim Dokja as well."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">To conclude, Ye Hyunwoo's attack was not directed at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo's wind passed by me and collided with something in the air on the other side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of something falling on the floor. Sounds reminiscent of the claws of large animals were scattered about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When [Way of the Wind] was activated from Ye Hyunwoo's fingertips, the face of the assassin hiding in the alley was revealed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Tsk-"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The assassin had the face of a bear. The so-called Bear Beastman.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was an animal that had never been seen here before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy must have sensed danger and immediately growled and ran out of the alley.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Ye Hyunwoo was faster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo, who flew with [Way of the Wind], was already standing behind the beast.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Quad deuk.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">The bear's knees bent to opposite sides, making an eerie sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the bear howled in pain, Ye Hyunwoo grabbed the back of its neck and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you doing, you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A completely different tone from usual. Gurgling, blood bubbles flowed from the mouth of the frightened bear beast.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who ordered you here? Tell me. If you don’t speak until the count of three, you will die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A menacing tone of voice that he never showed in front of me. I once again realize what kind of person he is.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is the 7th aApostle of the Apostolic Association and the actual representative of Chungmuro.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"One."</p>
<p class="orv_line">While coming this far, Ye Hyunwoo must have been caught up in countless plots and schemes that I was unaware of.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The bear beast panted and spoke as if in a fit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You will never succeed."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The prisoner was left lying limp on the floor. It looks like the stories and magic power he had were not enough.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was almost surprising that a surprise attack was attempted in this condition.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo frowned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Shall we wake him up again and torture him the Kim Dokja way?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that I heard a system message in my ears.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your approval rating drops.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently, 68% of prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since the start of full-scale narrative repair, the approval rating has not fallen even once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But why is the approval rating dropping at this time?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your approval rating drops.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently, 67% of prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo also looked at me, probably feeling uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Something doesn’t feel right. I guess my companions…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw a group of shadows approaching through a dark alley.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lanterns rising one by one from the darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't like they came to ask for a change in the story. This was because the faces of the prisoners swaying like ghosts above the lanterns were unfamiliar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not only the face but also the size was the same. Their physiques are at least twice as large as those of the beasts in the nearby area.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[It was true that the southern wolves were exterminated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A mantra that sends shivers down your spine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a brown bear there, a meter taller than the other beasts, wearing a skull mask that covered half of its face.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation 'A bear that will Spare One's life if One pretends to be Dead'’s eyes are flashing.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Judging by the pressure felt and the atmosphere it gave off, there was no doubt about it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That guy is a 'Historical-grade Constellation'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story that makes up this incarnation has been greatly worn.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">To be precise, it is the incarnation of a Historical-grade Constellation that has lost most of its stories and whose status has been greatly reduced.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An animal-type Constellation that failed to enter the &lt;Zodiac&gt; and remained in Zone 13.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed to be a similar case to 'The Wolf Who Covets Little Red Riding Hood', which we fought against before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the darkness, the brown bear's huge claws gave off a cold light.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Kill them all. The southern part of Zone 13 is the 'Bear' area from today.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After repeating his words in unison, the bear beasts began plundering, crushing all the surrounding houses with their huge paws.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"W-what! Kwaaaaaaaa!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Claws flew in without asking or answering. The prisoners, their entire houses torn apart, were screaming.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your approval rating drops.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently, 66% of the prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I understand why the approval rating continues to decrease. Those bears were randomly slaughtering the prisoners in Zone 13 who supported us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the numbers, the number of troops seems to be well over 300.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That guy is the same case as the 'wolf' back then, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. I think we need to be careful. This time, there is no story to use."</p>
<p class="orv_line">With the wolves, the「Three Little Pig」scenario was in effect, so staging could be used.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time the case is different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Ye Hyunwoo had calm eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Here, would I be like Kim Dokja by taking the lead and fighting, or would I be more like Kim Dokja if I had to hide behind and encourage my companions?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a moment and then answered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"They both feel like Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja would have been at the forefront of the fight while encouraging his companions to fight behind the scenes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo nodded his head as if he understood what I said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then I’ll do as I please here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Black magic power flowed from Ye Hyunwoo’s whole body. I was a little surprised because it was my first time seeing him truly start a story.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Armless Panda' growls.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Originally, Ye Hyunwoo was a supporter-type incarnation who mainly used [Magic Charge] and [Magic Sharing] skills.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A skill position with a combination in mind with Gong Pildu, who uses [Magic Turret] from the beginning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, here, Ye Hyunwoo gained the power to change his position.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kaaaaak!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Every time Ye Hyunwoo's sword moved, there was a cracking sound of something breaking. It was the same fist that had grazed my mask earlier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The bears who saw Ye Hyunwoo screamed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Bear?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Stop! We are the same kind!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m not a bear."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo said without a smile, holding a bamboo stick near his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m a panda."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Most of the beastmen in Zone 13 are incarnations whose stories have been damaged.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there were also people who had made a name for themselves before joining the 'Recycling Center'. Those prisoners were unable to stop Ye Hyunwoo and fell out one after another.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now Ye Hyeonwoo has combat power comparable to that of the highest-level incarnations, even with his support-related skills sealed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh my god, is this guy really him?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The 'panda' is here!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kill the damn story thief!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A story thief?</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the angry bears all rushed towards Ye Hyunwoo, Ye Hyunwoo's hands and feet also was ready to get busy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just then, my colleagues sensed the commotion and ran out from inside the brick house.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are those bears?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, those bastards— Hyunwoo-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi, Kyung Sein, and Cha Yerin, who must have been sleeping, also rubbed her eyes and stuck her face out the window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Afterwards, the crane owner came out screaming. The crane owner, who quickly looked around, seemed to have realized what was going on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Brown bear! What on earth are you doing? Why are you doing this—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The brown bear paid no heed to the crane's words and continued to trample on the southern house site.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein asked with a frown.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are those bears?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"These are the bears that rule the northern part of Zone 13. They never crossed over when there were wolves…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The crane owner, his beak clenched, answered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don’t know either. Why are they suddenly doing something like this… I heard that the northern beastmen are also showing favor towards them recently."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your approval rating drops.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently, 65% of the prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, the crane owner also made a decision.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"All southern beasts, take up arms! Defend your home from the northerners!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Those who are injured, hide inside the brick house!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The situation was not good. If this is the case, it will ultimately lead to conflict between the north and south.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your approval rating drops.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently, 64% of the prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The fight must be stopped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If we cannot stop it, we must at least protect the prisoners in the southern region.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you can’t fight, just pretend to be dead! Then you have a chance of survival!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The modifier of the brown bear that leads the bears is 'a bear that will Spare One's Lifeif One pretends to be dead'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging by the story, if you're lucky, there's a chance that 'pretending to be dead' might work.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that too is nothing more than a makeshift.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your approval rating drops.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently, 63% of the prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">How do we stop fighting?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Let's think. There is a reason for every incident in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;. There may be a reason why the bears came to the south now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that time, a shout from a corner caught my ear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kill the panda!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why does it appear in all the stories!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What’s so fun about chewing bamboo all the time!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I can roll around too!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">No way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Caught you!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A bear whose nose was hit by Ye Hyunwoo passed out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The number of bear beasts that Ye Hyunwoo had defeated had already exceeded ten, but the bears were still desperately clinging only to Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason was obvious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"These bears want to become 'pandas'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shouted with all my magic.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Everyone, stop!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">One by one, the bears surrounding Ye Hyunwoo turned to look at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will help your stories become famous again."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The bear beastmen's eyes were shaking when they heard what I said. It works.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There’s no need to fight like this. If you’re jealous of the panda, you too can—"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Shut up!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With the brown bear's mantra, the bears stopped. The bears looked at each other and bared their teeth at us again.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Kill him! Don’t let anyone who pretends to be dead live!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't understand. I told them this much, but they're still attacking me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I activated 「Persistent Murim Master」 and cut down the two charging bears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I watched the bears' claws that had been clawing at me break apart, I realized how serious their condition was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Each and every one of the seemingly fearsome bear beastmen was in need of immediate reinforcement.</p>
<p class="orv_line">These are people whose balance in their incarnation body has been completely destroyed due to the accumulation of life in the impoverished Zone 13.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were attacking, ignoring their own lives.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story of the lost name is falling apart.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Tales that are so old that it is unclear whether they can be staged.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Stories whose names have even disappeared and even  the &lt;Star Stream&gt; has forgotten them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A conversation with Lycaon from a few days ago flashed through my mind.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【I understand what student wants to do. But not everyone can be saved by student.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the time, I didn't know what that meant.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Can we force our dreams on those who have lost their own stories forever, student?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There are people in the world who have lost 'their own story' forever.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kill the panda! If you kill it, you will get the story!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s mine. It’s mine!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aim for him! He has more stories than the panda!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There’s a wolf over there too!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a world where their own stories disappeared, what they could do was limited.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aim for the brick house! Most of the new stories are held by the beastmen over there!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Stealing other people's dreams.</p>
