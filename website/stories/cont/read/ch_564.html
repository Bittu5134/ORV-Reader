<p class="orv_line">This did not bode well.</p>

<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey...... are you all right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I turned my head to see the worried-looking reader ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Uh, yeah. And you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m fine. I hope so.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reader ahjussi&#x27;s face was still white. It would be even stranger if he was still sane under the</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">circumstances.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stiffly bowed my head in greeting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thank you for earlier. You saved my life.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, the credit should go to him, not me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He fought against the Cheoldoo Group&#x27;s boss to save me with a physique that was at least as</p>
<p class="orv_line">good as Kim Dokja&#x27;s.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the &#x27;absolute good&#x27; system&#x27;s eyes are shining.]</div>[The constellations of the 'absolute good' system's eyes are shining.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, he was actually embarrassed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, rather, I am owe you. If you hadn&#x27;t saved me, I would be lying there too, but...... the germs</p>
<p class="orv_line">worked for you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi still doesn&#x27;t know that I &#x27;demagogy killed&#x27; the people of Geumho Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought about just being honest, but I figured it was probably better not to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#x27;t know either, they also killed germs together.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe only your germs died? Although I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s possible.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He seemed to conclude that was the only answer. Instead of answering him, I looked toward the</p>
<p class="orv_line">bodies.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He interpreted my silence and he quickly added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s not your fault, you did the best you could.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reader ahjussi let out a small sigh, looked at me with a pitying look on his face, and then</p>
<p class="orv_line">looked back at the dead people and muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Honestly..... they didn&#x27;t seem to be good people.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt guilty for trying to deceive a naive middle-aged man, but I thought it was better than telling</p>
<p class="orv_line">him the truth.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, I have the skill to figure it out.</p>

<p>No, I can see this?</p>
<p>I looked at the sorrowful ahjussi&#x27;s profile.</p>
<p>Should I see just one?</p>

<p>Ahjussi&#x27;s first comment immediately came to my mind.</p>
<p>The story about having a daughter must be true.</p>
<p>Just one more.</p>

<p class="orv_line">For some reason, I felt like I could trust this man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Feeling unnecessarily apologetic, I held out my hand to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Allow me to introduce myself.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;My name is Cheon Inho.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see him flustered by my words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pointed a finger at my face and smiled weakly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s his name.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, I see, that sounds like a name I&#x27;ve heard before.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He didn&#x27;t seem to recognize Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He&#x27;s the villain in the beginning, at Geumho Station.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh......!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yeah. That&#x27;s right, the bad guy.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He had other nicknames, such as &#x27;the one to be teared to death&#x27; and &#x27;someone to burn to death</p>
<p class="orv_line">with Hellfire&#x27;, but I didn&#x27;t say those.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi&#x27;s face had already turned pale.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;W-what should we do then?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s still early, so there&#x27;s room for renewal, right? What about you? Who are you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m Lee Dansoo...... it says.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">That seems to be the name of the person ahjussi&#x27;s possessing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansoo, Lee Dansoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t remember anything off the top of my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, if he knows the name of the person he&#x27;s possessing, can he see his attribute window?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ll give you my attributes and skills.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait, you can&#x27;t say things like that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What? Oh, yeah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The old man came to his senses as if he had remembered something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You sound just like Kim Dokja, hehe.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yeah. It&#x27;s better to act like him right now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you finish reading &#x27;that novel&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well, technically, I didn&#x27;t read it, I wrote it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then everyone who read that novel is like us.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly realized what he was thinking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#x27;t worry too much. I&#x27;m sure they all survived, just like us.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Especially his daughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She didn&#x27;t study, she just read Omniscient Reader, so she 100% survived. The old man smiled</p>
<p class="orv_line">weakly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Shall we call ourselves by the names we just mentioned from now one?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;All right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He nodded, his eyes slightly relaxed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#x27;t like we&#x27;d had a conversation where he&#x27;d asked me who was my favorite, but I felt like</p>
<p class="orv_line">we&#x27;d suddenly formed a plausible bond.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that was the end of our fraternity.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Subsequently, Bihyung appeared out of thin air. I didn&#x27;t know what it was, but it was a sign that I</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">had finally solved the first scenario&#x27;s many problems.</p>
<p class="orv_line">way...... I never thought you could to use the &lt;Star Stream&gt;&#x27;s &#x27;directing system&#x27; in this way.......]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung looked down at me and grumbled for a while, before smiling wryly and saying.</p>

<p class="orv_line">I already knew what Bihyung was going to say next. Probably the same goes for the man next to</p>

<p class="orv_line">escenario, you&#x27;re entitled the sponsorship of the &#x27;constellations&#x27;. Waahhh! How about it? Aren&#x27;t</p>
<p class="orv_line">you looking forward to it?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">We were about to embark on the first key event of &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27;, the Sponsor Selection.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Bihyung scratched his head.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Of course not, we already knew that.</p>

<p class="orv_line">that will take place.......]</p>
<p class="orv_line">You won&#x27;t be able to catch a single ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung gave his speech with an expression of bewilderment as he saw me yawning, stopping</p>
<p class="orv_line">only when he heard the constellations&#x27; bitter comments.</p>

<p class="orv_line">The constellations twinkled above Bihyung&#x27;s head, which seemed to brighten at first glance.</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[Anyway, the constellations are impatient. Let&#x27;s get started!]</div>[Anyway, the constellations are impatient. Let's get started!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was still very early in the story, so I didn&#x27;t expect any great constellations to come.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There&#x27;s a possibility that a great constellation like Great Sage, Heaven&#x27;s Equal or Uriel will</p>
<p class="orv_line">appear to Kim Dokja, but that&#x27;s only because he was the protagonist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At best, I&#x27;ll have the &#x27;Monarch of the Small Fries&#x27; or something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t expect it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I really didn&#x27;t expect that much.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">But.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">It won&#x27;t be Great Sage, but...... there could be a good constellation, right?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had a really hard time.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">And a screen popped up in front of me.</p>
