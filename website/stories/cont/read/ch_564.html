<p class="orv_line">(TL:From this point on Ch-564 to Ch-602 are Edited MTLs and may have a lot of errors and formatting issues, if you know better translations you can contact me, so you can either wait or you can edit these chapters yourself (◕‿↼) )</p>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 When you say 'kill', do you mean I have to kill them myself? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Although it doesn't appear in Omniscient Reader, there is an incarnation that solved the first scenario using 'suicide' in 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fingersnapper 'Christina Page'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A former legal hypnosis specialist at the FBI, she solved the first scenario by brainwashing a criminal she was working with into committing suicide.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Demagogy Killing.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">The way I was credited was similar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The characters who believed the misinformation chose to 'take their own lives' because of me, and I was credited for an 'indirect murder' for causing the mass suicide.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if such a murder was even possible, but it happened.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character you are currently possessing is 'Demagogue Cheon Inho'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps it's because he's the one I'm possessing.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your attunement to the character you are currently possessing is too high.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Disable some of the possessed character's attributes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As I looked down at my bloody hands, I slowly realized what I had done.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I hadn't possessed Cheon Inho, what would have happened to the people of Geumho Station?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Wouldn't they have been killed by Cheon Inho the same way anyway? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If so, was it the writer Lee Hakhyun or the character Cheon Inho who killed them?</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this world, am I a murderer who killed people or a writer who described the death of a character?</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I breathed in and out, my complicated thoughts quickly subsided.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive attribute is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Now was not the time for moral tension.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I would encounter people like Life Leader Kim Cheolyang many times in the future.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I must continue to live in this world by killing people.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Compensation settlement is delayed due to an unexpected scenario check. Please wait.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At least until I figure out the secrets of this world.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' is interested in you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the 'absolute evil' system are interested in you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A few constellations are curious about your name.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I came to my senses as the messages from the constellations began in earnest.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the 'absolute evil' system are backing you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellations have sponsored you 300 coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I had the attention of the constellations of the 'absolute evil' system.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, they had interpreted my 'demagogy killing' in a malicious way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This did not bode well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This will make it harder for me to get sponsorship from the constellations of the 'absolute good' system.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the 'absolute good' system are shocked by the local tragedy.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the 'absolute good' system are moved by your heroism.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Huh?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the 'absolute good' system are impressed by your good intentions in trying to save everyone.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellations have sponsored you 300 coins.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the 'absolute evil' system are questioning what the hell are they talking about.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Everyone seems to have their own interpretation of this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey...... are you all right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I turned my head to see the worried-looking reader ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uh, yeah. And you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm fine. I hope so."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reader ahjussi's face was still white. It would be even stranger if he was still sane under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stiffly bowed my head in greeting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you for earlier. You saved my life."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, the credit should go to him, not me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He fought against the Cheoldoo Group's boss to save me with a physique that was at least as good as Kim Dokja's.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the 'absolute good' system's eyes are shining.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, he was actually embarrassed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, rather, I am owe you. If you hadn't saved me, I would be lying there too, but...... the germs worked for you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi still doesn't know that I 'demagogy killed' the people of Geumho Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought about just being honest, but I figured it was probably better not to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't know either, they also killed germs together......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Maybe only your germs died? Although I don't know if that's possible......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He seemed to conclude that was the only answer. Instead of answering him, I looked toward the bodies.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He interpreted my silence and he quickly added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's not your fault, you did the best you could."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reader ahjussi let out a small sigh, looked at me with a pitying look on his face, and then looked back at the dead people and muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Honestly..... they didn't seem to be good people."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt guilty for trying to deceive a naive middle-aged man, but I thought it was better than telling him the truth.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' admires your wickedness.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Woman Who Pours Water into a Bottomless Pit' is touched by your heart.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Which character does this ahjussi possess, anyway?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Given his unfamiliar appearance, I'm pretty sure he's an extra.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, I have the skill to figure it out.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The information of this person can't be read in 'Character List'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This person is a 'character' but not a 'character'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I see what the situation is.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This man's body is a character, but the man's spirit that's possessing it is not.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill has been activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that a strange message popped up.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Readers' Comments List' has been activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Readers' Comments List?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Do you want to use 'Readers' Comments List' in this person?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded tentatively.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Checking the reader's profile information.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">

<div class="orv_window">
<p>No, I can see this?</p>
<p>I looked at the sorrowful ahjussi's profile.</p>
<p>Should I see just one?</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Jiyoon-ah, are you reading a novel in your room again?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—(Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, Chapter 1)</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>Ahjussi's first comment immediately came to my mind.</p>
<p>The story about having a daughter must be true.</p>
<p>Just one more.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Jiyoon-ah, open the door. I know you're reading the novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—(Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, Chapter 7)</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>I thought I knew how this ahjussi came to found Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>I've already seen two, so let's just take a look at the rest.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">How do I pay for the next episode?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—(Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, Chapter 25)</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<h3 class="orv_window_title">[Pay coins to see additional comments.]</h3>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">For some reason, I felt like I could trust this man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Feeling unnecessarily apologetic, I held out my hand to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Allow me to introduce myself."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Okay."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"My name is Cheon Inho."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see him flustered by my words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pointed a finger at my face and smiled weakly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's his name."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, I see, that sounds like a name I've heard before......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He didn't seem to recognize Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He's the villain in the beginning, at Geumho Station."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh......!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yeah. That's right, the bad guy."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He had other nicknames, such as 'the one to be teared to death' and 'someone to burn to death with Hellfire', but I didn't say those.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi's face had already turned pale.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"W-what should we do then?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's still early, so there's room for renewal, right? What about you? Who are you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm Lee Dansoo...... it says."</p>
<p class="orv_line">That seems to be the name of the person ahjussi's possessing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansoo, Lee Dansoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't remember anything off the top of my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, if he knows the name of the person he's possessing, can he see his attribute window?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll give you my attributes and skills......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait, you can't say things like that."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What? Oh, yeah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The old man came to his senses as if he had remembered something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You sound just like Kim Dokja, hehe."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yeah. It's better to act like him right now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you finish reading 'that novel'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well, technically, I didn't read it, I wrote it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then everyone who read that novel is like us......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly realized what he was thinking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't worry too much. I'm sure they all survived, just like us."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Especially his daughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She didn't study, she just read Omniscient Reader, so she 100% survived. The old man smiled weakly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Shall we call ourselves by the names we just mentioned from now one?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"All right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He nodded, his eyes slightly relaxed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't like we'd had a conversation where he'd asked me who was my favorite, but I felt like we'd suddenly formed a plausible bond.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that was the end of our fraternity.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Survivors from the areas 3-4 of Geumho Station: Cheon Inho, Lee Dansoo. A total of 2 survivors.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The system message that had been interrupted began to play again.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Additional compensation settlement will begin.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[200 coins have been earned as additional compensation.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Subsequently, Bihyung appeared out of thin air. I didn't know what it was, but it was a sign that I had finally solved the first scenario's many problems.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[It's really weird. There were some unusual areas, but none of them solved the scenario in this way...... I never thought you could to use the &lt;Star Stream&gt;'s 'directing system' in this way.......]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung looked down at me and grumbled for a while, before smiling wryly and saying.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Anyway, congratulations, you passed the first scenario with flying colors.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I already knew what Bihyung was going to say next. Probably the same goes for the man next to me.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Now, shouldn't there be a reward for overcoming the hardships? As a reward for the first scenario, you're entitled the sponsorship of the 'constellations'. Waahhh! How about it? Aren't you looking forward to it?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">We were about to embark on the first key event of 'Omniscient Reader', the Sponsor Selection.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Bihyung scratched his head.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Hmm, that's weird. You are not surprised nor confused.......]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course not, we already knew that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">You'll be just like me after you've said the same line a hundred times.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[If you haven't realized by now, you are incredible weak, and if you are thrown into the scenarios that will take place.......]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">You won't be able to catch a single ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung gave his speech with an expression of bewilderment as he saw me yawning, stopping only when he heard the constellations' bitter comments.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A few constellations are tired of Bihyung's explanations.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' urges him to get on with it!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations twinkled above Bihyung's head, which seemed to brighten at first glance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder how many people have gathered for this &lt;Sponsor Selection&gt;?</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Anyway, the constellations are impatient. Let's get started!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was still very early in the story, so I didn't expect any great constellations to come.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There's a possibility that a great constellation like Great Sage, Heaven's Equal or Uriel will appear to Kim Dokja, but that's only because he was the protagonist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At best, I'll have the 'Monarch of the Small Fries' or something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't expect it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I really didn't expect that much.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">It won't be Great Sage, but...... there could be a good constellation, right?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had a really hard time.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">And a screen popped up in front of me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There are a total of 10 constellations waiting for your choice.]</p></div>
