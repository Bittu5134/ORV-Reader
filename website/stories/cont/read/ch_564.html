<p class="orv_line">"Hey...... are you all right?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I turned my head to see the worried-looking reader ahjussi.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Uh, yeah. And you?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm fine. I hope so."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The reader ahjussi's face was still white. It would be even stranger if he was still sane under the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I stiffly bowed my head in greeting.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you for earlier. You saved my life."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, the credit should go to him, not me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">He fought against the Cheoldoo Group's boss to save me with a physique that was at least as</p>

<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the 'absolute good' system's eyes are shining.]</p></div>

<p class="orv_line">However, he was actually embarrassed.</p>

<p class="orv_line">"No, rather, I am owe you. If you hadn't saved me, I would be lying there too, but...... the germs</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">worked for you?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi still doesn't know that I 'demagogy killed' the people of Geumho Station.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I thought about just being honest, but I figured it was probably better not to.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't know either, they also killed germs together......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Maybe only your germs died? Although I don't know if that's possible......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">He seemed to conclude that was the only answer. Instead of answering him, I looked toward the</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">bodies.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">He interpreted my silence and he quickly added.</p>

<p class="orv_line">"It's not your fault, you did the best you could."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The reader ahjussi let out a small sigh, looked at me with a pitying look on his face, and then</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">looked back at the dead people and muttered.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Honestly..... they didn't seem to be good people."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I felt guilty for trying to deceive a naive middle-aged man, but I thought it was better than telling</p>

<p class="orv_line">For some reason, I felt like I could trust this man.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Feeling unnecessarily apologetic, I held out my hand to him.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Allow me to introduce myself."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Okay."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"My name is Cheon Inho."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I could see him flustered by my words.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I pointed a finger at my face and smiled weakly.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"That's his name."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, I see, that sounds like a name I've heard before......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">He didn't seem to recognize Cheon Inho.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"He's the villain in the beginning, at Geumho Station."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh......!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yeah. That's right, the bad guy."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">He had other nicknames, such as 'the one to be teared to death' and 'someone to burn to death</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">with Hellfire', but I didn't say those.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi's face had already turned pale.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"W-what should we do then?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's still early, so there's room for renewal, right? What about you? Who are you?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm Lee Dansoo...... it says."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">That seems to be the name of the person ahjussi's possessing.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansoo, Lee Dansoo.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't remember anything off the top of my head.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, if he knows the name of the person he's possessing, can he see his attribute window?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll give you my attributes and skills......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait, you can't say things like that."</p>

<p class="orv_line">"You sound just like Kim Dokja, hehe."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yeah. It's better to act like him right now."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you finish reading 'that novel'?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Well, technically, I didn't read it, I wrote it.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Then everyone who read that novel is like us......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly realized what he was thinking.</p>

<p class="orv_line">"Don't worry too much. I'm sure they all survived, just like us."</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Especially his daughter.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">She didn't study, she just read Omniscient Reader, so she 100% survived. The old man smiled</p>

<p class="orv_line">weakly.</p>

<p class="orv_line">"Thank you."</p>
<br>

<p class="orv_line">"All right."</p>

<p class="orv_line">He nodded, his eyes slightly relaxed.</p>
<br>

<p class="orv_line">It wasn't like we'd had a conversation where he'd asked me who was my favorite, but I felt like</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">we'd suddenly formed a plausible bond.</p>

<p class="orv_line">We were about to embark on the first key event of 'Omniscient Reader', the Sponsor Selection.</p>

<p class="orv_line">I know.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Bihyung gave his speech with an expression of bewilderment as he saw me yawning, stopping</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was still very early in the story, so I didn't expect any great constellations to come.</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">There's a possibility that a great constellation like Great Sage, Heaven's Equal or Uriel will</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">appear to Kim Dokja, but that's only because he was the protagonist.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">At best, I'll have the 'Monarch of the Small Fries' or something.</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't expect it.</p>
