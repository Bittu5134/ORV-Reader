<hr>
「When you say &#39;kill&#39;, do you mean I have to kill them myself?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Although it doesn&#39;t appear in Omniscient Reader, there is an incarnation that solved the first</p>
<p class="orv_line">scenario using &#39;suicide&#39; in &#39;Ways of Survival&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fingersnapper &#39;Christina Page&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A former legal hypnosis specialist at the FBI, she solved the first scenario by brainwashing a</p>
<p class="orv_line">criminal she was working with into committing suicide.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Demagogy Killing.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The way I was credited was similar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The characters who believed the misinformation chose to &#39;take their own lives&#39; because of me,</p>
<p class="orv_line">and I was credited for an &#39;indirect murder&#39; for causing the mass suicide.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if such a murder was even possible, but it happened.</p>
[The character you are currently possessing is &#39;Demagogue Cheon Inho&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps it&#39;s because he&#39;s the one I&#39;m possessing.</p>
[Your attunement to the character you are currently possessing is too high.]</p></div>
[Disable some of the possessed character&#39;s attributes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As I looked down at my bloody hands, I slowly realized what I had done.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I hadn&#39;t possessed Cheon Inho, what would have happened to the people of Geumho Station?</p>
「Wouldn&#39;t they have been killed by Cheon Inho the same way anyway?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If so, was it the writer Lee Hakhyun or the character Cheon Inho who killed them?</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this world, am I a murderer who killed people or a writer who described the death of a</p>
<p class="orv_line">character?</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I breathed in and out, my complicated thoughts quickly subsided.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">[The exclusive attribute is activated.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now was not the time for moral tension.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I would encounter people like Life Leader Kim Cheolyang many times in the future.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I must continue to live in this world by killing people.</p>
[Compensation settlement is delayed due to an unexpected scenario check. Please wait.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At least until I figure out the secrets of this world.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Monarch of the Small Fries&#39; is interested in you.]</p></div>
[The constellations of the &#39;absolute evil&#39; system are interested in you.]</p></div>
[A few constellations are curious about your name.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I came to my senses as the messages from the constellations began in earnest.</p>
[The constellations of the &#39;absolute evil&#39; system are backing you.]</p></div>
[Constellations have sponsored you 300 coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I had the attention of the constellations of the &#39;absolute evil&#39; system.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, they had interpreted my &#39;demagogy killing&#39; in a malicious way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This did not bode well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This will make it harder for me to get sponsorship from the constellations of the &#39;absolute good&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">system.</p>

<p class="orv_line">about.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Everyone seems to have their own interpretation of this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey...... are you all right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I turned my head to see the worried-looking reader ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Uh, yeah. And you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m fine. I hope so.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reader ahjussi&#39;s face was still white. It would be even stranger if he was still sane under the</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">circumstances.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stiffly bowed my head in greeting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thank you for earlier. You saved my life.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, the credit should go to him, not me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He fought against the Cheoldoo Group&#39;s boss to save me with a physique that was at least as</p>
<p class="orv_line">good as Kim Dokja&#39;s.</p>
[The constellations of the &#39;absolute good&#39; system&#39;s eyes are shining.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, he was actually embarrassed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, rather, I am owe you. If you hadn&#39;t saved me, I would be lying there too, but...... the germs</p>
<p class="orv_line">worked for you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi still doesn&#39;t know that I &#39;demagogy killed&#39; the people of Geumho Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought about just being honest, but I figured it was probably better not to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t know either, they also killed germs together.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe only your germs died? Although I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s possible.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He seemed to conclude that was the only answer. Instead of answering him, I looked toward the</p>
<p class="orv_line">bodies.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He interpreted my silence and he quickly added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s not your fault, you did the best you could.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reader ahjussi let out a small sigh, looked at me with a pitying look on his face, and then</p>
<p class="orv_line">looked back at the dead people and muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Honestly..... they didn&#39;t seem to be good people.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt guilty for trying to deceive a naive middle-aged man, but I thought it was better than telling</p>
<p class="orv_line">him the truth.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Which character does this ahjussi possess, anyway?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Given his unfamiliar appearance, I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s an extra.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, I have the skill to figure it out.</p>

<p>No, I can see this?</p>
<p>I looked at the sorrowful ahjussi&#39;s profile.</p>
<p>Should I see just one?</p>

<p>Ahjussi&#39;s first comment immediately came to my mind.</p>

<p class="orv_line">For some reason, I felt like I could trust this man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Feeling unnecessarily apologetic, I held out my hand to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Allow me to introduce myself.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;My name is Cheon Inho.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see him flustered by my words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pointed a finger at my face and smiled weakly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s his name.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, I see, that sounds like a name I&#39;ve heard before.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He didn&#39;t seem to recognize Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He&#39;s the villain in the beginning, at Geumho Station.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh......!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yeah. That&#39;s right, the bad guy.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He had other nicknames, such as &#39;the one to be teared to death&#39; and &#39;someone to burn to death</p>
<p class="orv_line">with Hellfire&#39;, but I didn&#39;t say those.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi&#39;s face had already turned pale.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;W-what should we do then?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s still early, so there&#39;s room for renewal, right? What about you? Who are you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m Lee Dansoo...... it says.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">That seems to be the name of the person ahjussi&#39;s possessing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansoo, Lee Dansoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t remember anything off the top of my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, if he knows the name of the person he&#39;s possessing, can he see his attribute window?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;ll give you my attributes and skills.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait, you can&#39;t say things like that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What? Oh, yeah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The old man came to his senses as if he had remembered something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You sound just like Kim Dokja, hehe.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yeah. It&#39;s better to act like him right now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you finish reading &#39;that novel&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well, technically, I didn&#39;t read it, I wrote it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then everyone who read that novel is like us.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly realized what he was thinking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#39;t worry too much. I&#39;m sure they all survived, just like us.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Especially his daughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She didn&#39;t study, she just read Omniscient Reader, so she 100% survived. The old man smiled</p>
<p class="orv_line">weakly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Shall we call ourselves by the names we just mentioned from now one?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;All right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He nodded, his eyes slightly relaxed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#39;t like we&#39;d had a conversation where he&#39;d asked me who was my favorite, but I felt like</p>
<p class="orv_line">we&#39;d suddenly formed a plausible bond.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that was the end of our fraternity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">survivors.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The system message that had been interrupted began to play again.</p>

[200 coins have been earned as additional compensation.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Subsequently, Bihyung appeared out of thin air. I didn&#39;t know what it was, but it was a sign that I</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">had finally solved the first scenario&#39;s many problems.</p>
<p class="orv_line">way...... I never thought you could to use the &lt;Star Stream&gt;&#39;s &#39;directing system&#39; in this way.......]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung looked down at me and grumbled for a while, before smiling wryly and saying.</p>
[Anyway, congratulations, you passed the first scenario with flying colors.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I already knew what Bihyung was going to say next. Probably the same goes for the man next to</p>
<p class="orv_line">me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">escenario, you&#39;re entitled the sponsorship of the &#39;constellations&#39;. Waahhh! How about it? Aren&#39;t</p>
<p class="orv_line">you looking forward to it?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">We were about to embark on the first key event of &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39;, the Sponsor Selection.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Bihyung scratched his head.</p>
[Hmm, that&#39;s weird. You are not surprised nor confused.......]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course not, we already knew that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">You&#39;ll be just like me after you&#39;ve said the same line a hundred times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">that will take place.......]</p>
<p class="orv_line">You won&#39;t be able to catch a single ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung gave his speech with an expression of bewilderment as he saw me yawning, stopping</p>
<p class="orv_line">only when he heard the constellations&#39; bitter comments.</p>
[A few constellations are tired of Bihyung&#39;s explanations.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Monarch of the Small Fries&#39; urges him to get on with it!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations twinkled above Bihyung&#39;s head, which seemed to brighten at first glance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder how many people have gathered for this &lt;Sponsor Selection&gt;?</p>
[Anyway, the constellations are impatient. Let&#39;s get started!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was still very early in the story, so I didn&#39;t expect any great constellations to come.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There&#39;s a possibility that a great constellation like Great Sage, Heaven&#39;s Equal or Uriel will</p>
<p class="orv_line">appear to Kim Dokja, but that&#39;s only because he was the protagonist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At best, I&#39;ll have the &#39;Monarch of the Small Fries&#39; or something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t expect it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I really didn&#39;t expect that much.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">But.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">It won&#39;t be Great Sage, but...... there could be a good constellation, right?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had a really hard time.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">And a screen popped up in front of me.</p>
[There are a total of 10 constellations waiting for your choice.]</p></div>
