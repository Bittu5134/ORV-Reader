            <div class="orv_title"><h1>733 Episode 28 House (11)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo, Cha Yerin, and Dansu ahjussi, who were supplying magical power, turned to look at Yoo Jonghyuk at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The expressions on their faces asked if he was really speaking in his right mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi with cognitive dissonance asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What did you just say…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could also hear Ye Hyunwoo muttering quietly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ha, there was a setting like that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King, who was tied to a chair, also shook his head in admiration.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He was the true Supreme King.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is truly the Supreme King, and if he continues like this, the entire story will fall apart. The brick house was getting thinner in real time.</p>
[The representation of &#39;staging&#39; is weakened!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When the 「staging」 collapses, the tale will stop its storytelling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that case, the constellations that were forcibly tied to this stage will be able to leave the scene without any significant damage.</p>
[Some of the constellations in the nebula &lt;Zodiac&gt; are taunting you.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Abyssal Black Flame Dragon&#39; makes an excited expression.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Reclining Dragon&#39; is curious about your plan.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If things continued like this, everything, whether it was a plan or not, was going to fall apart along with this brick house.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The dust and sand that fell down scattered  on my face. I looked down at the fallen dirt and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Can’t you just not eat &#39;food&#39; made by others?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk looked at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Isn’t it enough to fill your stomach no matter what you feed it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You, you can’t—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">For the first time, a feeling of fear appeared in little Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s eyes. Anyway, I held the powder in my hand and brought it to his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Eat, you bastard!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk stubbornly rebelled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My companions looked at me at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you really feeding him dirt right now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, no matter how you can do that to a child—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As expected, Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I ignored their words and forced little Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s mouth open and let out what was in my hand. Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s trembling neck moved.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I barely sighed and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You can’t eat real dirt, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, it might be possible to use the [Incite] skill, but I didn&#39;t want to go that far here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cha Yerin found a small piece on my hand and let out a small exclamation. It seemed like she realized late what this was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What I fed was fragments of stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">More precisely, it was a part of the &#39;story fragment&#39; that the &#39;Heir of the Eternal Name&#39; had swallowed.</p>
[The story &#39;Heir of the Eternal Name&#39; looks dissatisfied.]</p></div>
[Your lifespan decreases.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A &#39;story fragment&#39; that I managed to obtain through my earnest request.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If it’s a story fragment, this guy could eat it too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk, who has had a twisted personality since birth, has a &#39;set value&#39; in which he does not eat food unless he has made it himself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, there is an exception with &#39;Murim dumplings&#39;, but I don&#39;t know how to make them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So the next best option was &#39;story fragments&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yoo Jonghyuk. Come to your senses.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because even Yoo Jonghyuk, who does not eat food prepared by others, has received stories from other people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is that the look in Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s eyes when he received it was slightly bitter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yoo Jonghyuk?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If possible, I wanted to avoid doing this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In &#39;Ways of Survival&#39;, it is said that Yoo Jonghyuk once received a wrong transfusion of military story from Lee Hyunsung and briefly turned around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But for now there was no other way. I had to feed him something to fill his stomach.</p>
[The story &#39;Heir of the Eternal Name&#39; grins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Wait for a sec. But what is the story that Yoo Jonghyuk is obsessed with now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk was trembling and his eyes were rolling. The guy just looked up at me and put his head down on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, wait a minute.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wack wack. Wack wack.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey! Spit it out! Pick something up and eat it!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Either way, the guy started digging up the dirt. Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s eyes slowly returned to their senses. The guy with dirt on the corner of his mouth glared at me with wide eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You bastard, you made me suffer, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The loud-mouthed Killer King answered for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s dirt.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t eat dirt.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, you eat dirt. That’s Yoo Jonghyuk.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King pointed to the window with his chin. Little Yoo Jonghyuk looked at his own mouth reflected in the window with blank eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tried my best to ignore the look in the eyes of little Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
[Story fragment &#39;The man who eats eight meals a day&#39; is satisfied.]</p></div>
[The conditions for &#39;staging&#39; have been met.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;The First Pig To Die&#39; screams.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The story has been enriched once again. As the crumbling stage became solid once more, the pig constellations that had been preparing to step back rushed forward again.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Pig who built his house out of wood&#39; groans.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Cheer up, pigs. If you don’t want the story to be taken away by a wolf.</p>
[Some constellations in the nebula &lt;Zodiac&gt; are showing hostility towards you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The storm started to rage again.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know how much time has passed. Have I been this exhausted since I was trapped in the ichthyosaur&#39;s stomach?</p>
[The head of the Recycling Center admires your determination.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The party members who were supplying magical energy were also exhausted one by one. Some people were leaning against the wall, gasping for breath or completely fainting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I too was on the verge of losing my mind. What made me endure was the story engraved on the other side of the wall.</p>
「A wolf howled in the storm.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A storm came and the brick house withstood the wind. A story was created every time the wind left a scar on the wall.</p>
「A lone wolf who lost his home asked.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It is a new story of wolves.</p>
「&quot;Is that your home?&quot;asked the lone wolf.」</p></div>
「&quot;Then where is my home?&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The brick house did not answer.</p>
「&quot;If I can’t have a house.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then the wolf spoke.</p>
「&quot;I will not stop the storm until every house in the world is destroyed.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">All stories are written on the &#39;wall&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because there is a wall, events finally become &#39;stories&#39; and the constellations can safely indulge in stories.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Reclining Dragon&#39; is impressed by your &#39;hands-on-slaughter&#39; skill.]</p></div>
[Animal-shaped constellations that are not part of the Chinese zodiac are amazed by your story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yeah, feel free to take a look.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Abyssal Black Flame Dragon&#39; likes the sensibility of the wolves.]</p></div>
[Some constellations from the Chinese Zodiac are angry at your story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I used the characteristic of [Circulatory Conservation] to gather as much magical energy as possible to strengthen the &#39;Brick House&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to make this story continue a little longer.</p>
[The constellation &#39;The First Pig To Die&#39; screams!]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Pig That Built its House out of Wood&#39; cries out for help!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that something snapped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt my stomach turn, and a handful of blood spilled onto the floor. My head was dizzy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I raised my head to see what was going on.</p>
[The story &#39;The Three Little Pigs&#39; is destroyed.]</p></div>
[Some of the constellations corresponding to &#39;Pig&#39; in the Chinese zodiac have suffered a huge blow to their true bodies!]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;The Pig That Died First&#39; exits the scenario.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;The Pig That Built its House out of Wood&#39; exits the scenario.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did I realize what had happened.</p>
[&#39;Staging&#39; ends.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations were defeated.</p>
[&#39;The God of the Other World&#39; roars!]</p></div>
[Some of the constellations belonging to the Nebula &lt;Zodiac&gt; are afraid of the &#39;God of the Other World&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps it was natural.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how low the level of the &#39;God of the Other World&#39; was, there was no way that a great-grade constellation could rush in and suppress the power of the Outer God.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Abyssal Black Flame Dragon&#39; mocks the constellations, asking if they are just that scared.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">From now on, it was a complete gamble.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don’t open the door.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk spoke quietly as if he knew what I was going to do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you go out, you will die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Even if we stay here, everyone is still going to die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do not worry.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I lightly tapped little Yoo Jonghyuk on the shoulder and then spoke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No one will die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I opened the door, the streets of Zone 13 appeared, engulfed in silence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was strange. It&#39;s so quiet even though a storm is raging.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, the pressure pressing down on my entire body was several times stronger than when I faced the &#39;Wolf Constellation&#39; earlier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It didn&#39;t take long to realize what was happening.</p>
「Eye of the storm.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Now our &#39;Brick House&#39; was exactly in the &#39;center&#39; of the storm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now, 「Staging」 cannot protect us. If the storm twists in any direction, the brick house will be torn to pieces.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;O great god of the other world.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took a slow, deep breath and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Stop the storm. Haven’t you had enough of the stories?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A new story that sprouts in the place where the story of 「The Three Little Pigs」 was destroyed.</p>
[Your new story begins to germinate.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This story will now become the story of the wolf and us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And maybe the &#39;God of the Other World&#39; who led this storm can also receive a share.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The ending of every story is important.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Gods of the Other World&#39; have different levels depending on the status they have.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ancient species that once shook the entire scenario is crowned as the &#39;Old One&#39;, and the dominant species that filled the entire universe with fear is crowned as the &#39;Great Old One&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But whatever their original grade, they all have something in common.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You can now go &#39;home&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Deities who were excluded from the scenario and lost their constellations bodies to stay in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They endlessly wander around the world, looking for a place where they belong. After a long wandering, someone becomes a disaster in another world line, and someone else even colludes with dokkaebis.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The story can only be completed if you stop the storm here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">And someone makes an &#39;otherworldly covenant&#39;.</p>
[&#39;The god of another world&#39; is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">All &#39;Gods of the Other World&#39; are terribly lonely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It means you will have a constellation body to stay in.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">My body trembled just from him looking at me. If it was a normal incarnation, it wouldn&#39;t be strange if blood spilled from my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, I was able to endure it.</p>
[The story &#39;Heir of the Eternal Name&#39; yawns lightly.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Heir of the Eternal Name&#39; is a story about defeating the &#39;founder of the Absolute Throne&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, I was more resistant to the gods of the other world than anyone else in this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, the god of this world seemed perplexed when he saw me like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But even for a moment.</p>
【My house disappeared a long time ago.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The terrible storm began to move again. A force that seems to tear me to pieces at any moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Four winds meet to form a direction, and four more winds are added to that direction. It forms the tomb of the eight trigrams.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly closed my eyes and felt the wind blowing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if I had become a &#39;wall&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if the story of that wind would be engraved on my body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I uttered the sentence with all my might, as if I was pressing down to write it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thereby the wind exists everywhere and nowhere.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">For an instant, the storm that had been rolling in stopped like magic.</p>
【How do you know that enlightenment?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Through the storm that was slowly clearing, the appearance of the God of the Other World was revealed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled as I looked at that guy&#39;s story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How would I know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed like the Wolf Constellation had safely summoned the &#39;God of the Other World&#39; I mentioned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, I was not sure that the &#39;God of this world&#39; was the &#39;wolf&#39; of the &#39;world line&#39; I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, just as Asmodeus came in this 41st round, and just as &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; appeared here—if that wolf also overcame the long time and finally became a &#39;God of Another World&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Slowly, the wolf with wide eyes approached me.</p>
【No way.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If I were &#39;Lee Hakhyun&#39;, this gamble would have been impossible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But now I was acting under the name of &#39;Kim Dokja&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If so, there is a possibility.</p>
[The synchronization rate with the sponsor is increasing!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The wolf hurriedly came towards me. Looking at his height, which seems to be about three meters, his first description came to mind again.</p>
「He is about three meters tall. He is a wind fighter with both monster-like stamina and giant-like strength.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The wolf slowly lowered its gaze towards me. And he looked at me for a long time, as if reading the story buried in my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line"> 【Ho, hogu? Is it really you?】</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is the &#39;guide&#39; of the destroyed planet Kronos.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The prince of Imyuntar who taught Kim Dokja the [Way of the Wind].</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It is, Lycaon Isparang.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja once said: It is said that those who make an &#39;Outer World Covenant covenant of this world&#39; will not be able to see the true ◼️◼️.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But in the end, he too made a covenant with another world. He probably couldn&#39;t find the answer either. Because this damned world is designed so that no matter what you do, you can&#39;t reach the right ◼️◼️.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Same goes for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Make an &#39;Outer World Covenant &#39; with me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much I thought about it, this was the only way to fight against the Zodiac.</p>
<hr>

[Some constellations belonging to the nebula &lt;Tamra&gt;...]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Indirect messages from constellations pouring in endlessly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When the Recycling Center director waved his hand in the air as if he was annoyed, the messages scattered like a swarm of insects.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A screen appeared where the messages were scattered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A screen showing the scenery of Zone 13.</p>
[As you know, I like &#39;old stories&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The head of the Recycling Center smiled as he saw the incarnation and the wolf confronting each other on the screen.</p>
[Seeing that you are moved by that story, it seems that your story has already become an &#39;old story&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As he said that, he looked back at the flask behind him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Inside a huge flask the size of a person was a man wearing a white coat with his eyes closed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Recycling Center director asked, slowly placing his hand on the wall of the flask.</p>
[How many points would you give to that story, Demon King of Salvation?]</p></div>
