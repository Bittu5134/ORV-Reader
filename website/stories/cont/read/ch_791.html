<p class="orv_line">"I've never lent you my mouth, Archangel."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At Yoo Jonghyuk's irritating words, the Archangel's wings fluttered gloomily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Soon, with the sound of parts, a translucent figure like a butterfly that had just shed its skin from Yoo Jonghyuk's incarnation emerged.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' appears in an area outside the scenarios!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was the descent of a 'Narrative-grade Constellation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Archangel Uriel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellation that gave up all of its stories to protect Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Warm emerald eyes turned to me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I'm sorry. Did you wait long?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When I heard that voice, I suddenly felt like tears were about to fall.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[It's okay now. I'll protect you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Her incarnation body, which had descended halfway, was shaking unsteadily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was not a being from this world line, but Uriel from the 1,864th round. Perhaps she made a contract with the 'Uriel' of this world through some kind of covenant, and thus descended here now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uriel..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps the Kim Dokja she wanted to protect was not me. The Kim Dokja she remembers is not in this world. Perhaps he is not anywhere in the universe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, she came here to protect Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt the legacy of the old Kim Dokja in front of that noble determination.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But even with her arrival, things were not easy.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[An archangel protecting the Demon King, how interesting.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Do you think you can stop us alone?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 12 seats of &lt;Olympus&gt; were before my eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Pure Moonlight Hunter' reveals her status!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Almighty Sun' reveals his status!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Pure Moonlight Hunter 'Artemis' and Almighty Sun 'Apollo'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Two of the 12 seats came here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just to catch me. No, maybe it wasn't two.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Uriel, get out of the way.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The third constellation of the narrative-grade that appeared with a chilling blast of air.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Spokesperson of Justice and Wisdom' reveals her status!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Spokesperson of Justice and Wisdom, Athena.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel frowned, not knowing that she would come too.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You don't like it? And don't speak informally. I'm not the 'Uriel' you know?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did Athena notice something and her expression changed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You're not—]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Oh. Right. It's annoying to explain, so if you noticed, get out quickly.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Archangel of another world line. Why are you interfering with us?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Because you're doing bad things.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Bad things. Uriel glanced in my direction as she said that.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Since when did the 'Spokesperson of Justice and Wisdom' become a villain who persecutes the weak.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[He's not weak. He is the Demon King, and this world—]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Objections and penalties., do you think that boring logic you have is still working? Do you really think that kid is 'evil'?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Athena co	uldn't answer.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Even that kid is not even a constellation or a Demon King anymore. Because of that damned fate you've called, he's now a mere incarnation that can't resist anything. And yet you're going to kill that kid?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Athena bit her lips and glared at Uriel.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Are you really going to fight here?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Then what are you going to do?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Do you know what will happen if &lt;Eden&gt; and &lt;Olympus&gt; go to war?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[◼️Eat it. My &lt;Eden&gt; has already been destroyed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Athena's eyes looked like she was wondering what she meant, but she soon seemed to have made up her mind and took out her holy relic, 'Aegis'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Artemis. Apollo.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At Athena's signal, the three of the twelve divine seats surrounded Uriel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel glanced at them and spoke to Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Do you remember what I asked you to do?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk nodded.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[No matter what happens, you must protect him.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, Uriel and the three divine seats disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Following that, a radiance that covered the pitch-black universe burst out. As the red flames poured out by the omnipotent sun Apollo illuminated the universe, Artemis' arrow flew in, leaving a blue trail.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel was also holding a holy relic in her hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A sword containing the most sublime flame of [Hellfire].</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Flame of Karma.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the archangel's sword split the universe, the sun's corona and the hunter's arrow split apart at once. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">A fighting power that was on par with the 12 gods of &lt;Olympus&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Flame of Karma' was not only pressuring the three gods, but also slowly pushing them back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was truly astonishing power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much Uriel was the Archangel of &lt;Eden&gt;, she was not able to fully use the power of the 1,864th round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even a half-body, not an incarnation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And yet, that's all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Artemis, whose face turned blue, shouted as if she thought that this couldn't go on.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Athena, danger—!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel flew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the pure white wings spread out and rippled, leaving a deep shadow in the universe, Uriel's sword, which had cut off countless demon kings' heads, moved.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Everyone, fall back!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Athena raised Aegis at the signal. Aegis' immortal defense wall spread out while scattering.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[What the—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That 'immortal defense wall' was slowly melting away. Soon, the flames of [Hellfire] that completely tore through the outer shell of the defense wall were about to pour down on the heads of the three gods.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Get out!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A pitch-black wave came in silently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel was swept away by the wave in an instant. Then came the roar of the monsters. The sound of something being torn apart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The wave disappeared, and Uriel was staring at the direction the wave had come from with a large wound on her shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, as if responding to that gaze, the wave answered.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Foolish archangel. Do you know what you are up against?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My heart felt like it was going to burst just from hearing the voice. Sparks exploded fiercely all over the place. As if not caring about such probability, the giant body of the god was swaying in the void.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just witnessing their true form was enough to take my breath away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only after Yoo Jonghyuk, standing next to me, unleashed his status, did I barely manage to catch my breath and stare ahead. There was a mythical constellation of &lt;Olympus&gt; there.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Where his spear touches, it will soon become the sea. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Olympus&gt;'s third god. The spear that draws the boundary of the sea—Poseidon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel smiled bitterly.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Oh, the rumor has already spread that far?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Instead of answering, Poseidon grabbed his beloved Troiana. The waves of the deep sea surged like an active volcano through Troiana's spear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I staggered up like a crazy person.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uriel. No. Uriel—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it's Uriel, she can't face them all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I have to stop her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this continues, Uriel will die, but my voice didn't come out properly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grabbed Yoo Jonghyuk's wrist. Please save Uriel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Yoo Jonghyuk spoke in a blunt voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The scenario I received is to protect you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to swear at him. But my exhausted body did not listen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A distant wave crashed down on Uriel. It was a tidal wave that she, exhausted, could not handle alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thump.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was when the sound of gunfire was heard from somewhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thump.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One shot, two shots, three shots. The continuous barrage of fire directly hit the waves that were coming. It broke, broke again, and the momentum of the tidal wave began to weaken little by little.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goosebumps ran down my spine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't figure out what was going on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You're doing well. Be sure to keep that promise, Master."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew who that voice belonged to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, she was someone who shouldn't be here, someone who couldn't be.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk also looked at Lee Jihye with surprised eyes. He couldn't help it. The 'power' flowing out of Lee Jihye's body right now was clearly higher than Yoo Jonghyuk's own.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard the voice directed at me, I knew right away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Where did 'Lee Jihye' come from?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I can only help you for a little while. This 'covenant' is really short."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A covenant from another world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She came here even after making that difficult contract.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you for saving Gilyoung."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Gilyoung—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don’t worry. He’s safe."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thankfully, Gilyoung seemed to have returned safely to &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"My dongsaeng got beaten up in a faraway place, so I can’t just sit still as a noona."</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart kept pounding even though I knew I shouldn’t.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; was here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They came not to stop us, but to save us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye looked at me with calm eyes before turning back to Yoo Jonghyuk and saying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Master, I’ll say this once. Run away with all your might, taking ahjussi with you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk frowned. The expression on his face was that he didn’t like the fact that he had to 'run away' as the expression said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Lee Ji-hye ignored that expression and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You know that if you lose ahjussi, it’s all over, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don’t know how this world will end, but if ahjussi falls to that side, it’s definitely the worst ending. So I have to protect him."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even if you don’t say anything—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If by any chance ahjussi dies…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye took out the 'Ssangryong Sword' she had on her waist and added coldly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Master, you'll die to me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk opened his mouth as if he was dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well, where on earth would Yoo Jonghyuk hear such words from Lee Jihye?</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that Lee Jihye had the right to say such things.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was Lee Jihye of the 1,864th round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was a member of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;, an incarnation of Admiral Yi Sunsin, and the successor of the Breaking the Sky Swordsman who broke the sky after Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' proudly helps its incarnation.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When on earth did they appear?</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were constellations watching over this world where there wasn't even a scenario.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' cheers on the Maritime War God.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Goryeo's First Sword' admires the Maritime War God's spirit.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Maegeumjijon' praises the Maritime War God's courage.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">They were constellations.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently, a 'temporary channel' is in operation.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It seems that Bihyung opened a temporary channel for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Poseidon, who responded to their indirect messages, took a step forward.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Silent! This is not a place for the constellations of such low ranks  to interfere.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With Poseidon's gesture, waves began to surge from all directions. Top-tier marine species poked their heads out between the waves. Fangs that looked as if they would tear Lee Jihye apart at any moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye swung her sword toward the teeth of the waves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Breaking the Sky Sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Breaking the Sky Ryu Seong-gyeol.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sword light that flashed from the Ssangryong Sword pierced all the marine species in the waves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Poseidon's eyes widened in shock, and the deep-sea waves that had been engulfing him suddenly stopped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if to show respect to another master of the sea.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations of the 1,864th round called her this.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The monarch of the great sea. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of crashing waves was heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Across the pitch-black space, the sea three, the bows of the ships began to rise one by one behind Lee Jihye's back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I heard that our master had a showdown with Odin."</p>
<p class="orv_line">She stood at the front of the lined-up fleet and looked down at the sea god of Olympus with proud eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If it's you, I'll be able to get some relief."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the enraged Poseidon swung Traiana, the tidal wave surged again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The woman standing in front of the tidal wave raised her twin dragon swords. [The Ghost Fleet] moved.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The monarch of the sea is not defeated at sea. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye opened her mouth as if to prove that sentence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Load the cannon."</p>
