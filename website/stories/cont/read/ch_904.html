<p class="orv_line">"Demon King?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The judge's expression was expressed by Jo Jincheol's one word.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Jo Daehyeop! What do you mean, Demon King?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"With your tongue... you fooled people?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Tongue, with his tongue? Is there a Demon King related to the tongue?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the incarnations in the audience began to get curious one by one, Jo Jincheol's mouth continued to move.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"...A new world requires new laws."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Huh?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll knock you all out of that damn sky!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Huh?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"... I have my own life?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wait a minute. Is this kid reading the original story?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What the hell are you talking about, Jo Daehyeop. What kind of being is this newbie?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jo Jincheol answered in a deep breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Amazing. I think I only have a few stories of Great-grade, but if there is a person who has this kind of story, then he might be the talent our ancestors were looking for."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If it's our ancestors..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The great master of &lt;Black Cloud&gt;!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Whoa!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the examiner who fell over in surprise, I briefly wondered if this might be some kind of surprise newcomer party.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"On the planet I lived on, there were guys with a trait called 'middle school syndrome'. A devilish talent that pushed their delusions to the limit and eventually made them a reality..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I listened to the story, I vaguely thought I knew what Jo Jincheol had seen in me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Most Constellations that see you will probably experience cognitive dissonance. It will be hard to accept that someone who is neither a Constellation nor a Transcendental Constellation has such a strangely great status. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If they acknowledge you, the Constellations will have to accept that an incarnation that is nothing is stronger than them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So ordinary Constellations will not be able to face your existence and will only read fragments of distorted stories."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is that why she was curious about what other Constellations would see in me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was about to tell them that it was a complete misunderstanding, but Jo Jincheol, whose eyes had changed, shouted at me excitedly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Come to our &lt;Black Cloud Foundation&gt;. With your talent, I can contact the foundation's main server right now and help you download [Black Flame Sky Dance]."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Black Flame Sky Dance. It's a martial art that I don't want to learn just by hearing its name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the others seemed to have different thoughts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The &lt;Black Cloud Foundation&gt; made the first offer to recruit him?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Black Flame Sky! Oh my goodness. Isn't that the unique martial arts of the &lt;Black Cloud Foundation&gt; Executives?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He's a really enviable new recruit."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The situation was taking a strange turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The examiner lightly tapped my shoulder and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You're really lucky. Judging from your expression, I don't think you understand what's going on yet, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Black Cloud Foundation is one of the 'big corporations in the New Murim District. If you can ascend through that company, your future will be..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was about to say that it didn't seem like a very positive future, but then I heard the people around me talking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Damn, another parachute has appeared. You damned Constellation-spooners."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm jealous, though."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The expressions were filled with envy and jealousy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Listening to the rumbling voices, my mood became complicated for no reason. Perhaps the possibility of incarnation is mostly determined by the first scenario, 'Proof of Value'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations who survived until now without receiving proper sponsor selection still have to endure life waiting for the selection of the higher Constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Damn it. If only I could go to a large company..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the main story, Kim Dokja became a Constellation on his own without sponsor selection, but not everyone can take that path.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was worried about my colleagues again. Even if it was true that Dansu ahjussi and Ji Eunyu-ssi were selected by Narrative-grade Constellations, what would have happened to the other colleagues who did not choose at the sponsor selection?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The examiner patted my shoulder again and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"...So, if you enter the &lt;Black Cloud Foundation&gt; and polish your stories for about ten years, you can become an ascendant like Jo Daehyeop and become a dragon who assists the great Black Cloud Master. Do you know what kind of being the Black Cloud Master is?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I've heard of it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's right. Haha, you can't help but know. He's closer to the 'Final Dragon of the Apocalypse' than any other existing dragon!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In short, if you join there and suffer for ten years, you can become the Black Flame Dragon's footstool.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This human, if he knew that I was chosen by the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' in the first scenario's sponsor selection, he'd probably faint.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was about to express my intention to refuse without hesitation, but unfortunately someone interrupted me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why are you having such a pleasant conversation without me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Paradise Emperor Reinheit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jo Jincheol, sensing something strange, quickly blocked his way and warned him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Paradise Emperor, it's not your place to interfere. Our &lt;Black Cloud Foundation&gt; has already decided to recruit this cute guy."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't think you've heard that incarnation's opinion yet?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There's no need to listen! What kind of incarnation would dare to refuse to be recruited by the Foundation!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It seems you've already forgotten about the Mad Sword Emperor incident."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jo Jincheol's expression hardened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Mad Sword Emperor! Why are you bringing up that crazy woman?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even back then, didn't Jo Daehyeop misread the story and recklessly try to recruit her, and the Foundation branch was almost destroyed?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Please give me a chance too. Maybe he's a better fit for &lt;Olympus Technology&gt; than &lt;Black Cloud Foundation&gt;?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reinheit ignored the indignant Jo Jincheol and turned his ominous eyes toward me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hmm..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy unleashed the power of the Constellation and began to read my stories. It was the exact method Jo Jincheol had used.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered what kind of strange things I would hear this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's amazing. Even that 'Flame Demon Emperor Star' wouldn't have been able to build such a noble story in a scenario of the same level…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The examiner was surprised by Reinheit's words and asked again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Have you ever seen Flame Demon Emperor Star?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I've seen them once from afar. They're as beautiful as the rumors say. I couldn't get close because of the tale of the Monkey King…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Monkey King?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It sounds like a story about someone I know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Anyway, it's been a long time since I've seen an incarnation come up here with such a clear soul."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, Reinheit's [Echo] came into my ear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Excuse me, which great Demon King's household are you?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hmm?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He's the one who saved countless souls and built up good stories."</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I glared at him, he continued [Echo] with a deep smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Although I can't read your essence, I can strongly sense the tale of 'hypocrisy' from you. Hoho, how many beings have you deceived?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Look at this kid?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Unless you've received the grace of an Archangel, it would be difficult to build such a good story…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">—With this level of sorcery, you must have deceived countless Constellations to get here. Above all, your narrow eyes that even this power cannot see through…</p>
<p class="orv_line">The attendees of the ascension ceremony stirred once again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The grace of an Archangel? Is he from &lt;Eden&gt;?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But &lt;Eden&gt; wouldn't have opened a branch in the 'New Murim District'—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You can only have an incarnation that has received grace. Either way, it's a great thing."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before long, the whole place was filled with stories about me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Taking advantage of the atmosphere, Reinheit made a suggestion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Come to our &lt;Olympus Technology&gt;."</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I don't know why you left the Demon World and came here… but if a high-ranking Demon King's agent came here, it means there must be some unavoidable circumstance. &lt;Olympus&gt; can protect you. Even if you are being chased by &lt;Eden&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed like he had a huge misunderstanding about me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He must have judged me to be a high-ranking Demon King who was expelled from the Demon World or something similar…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thinking about it carefully, it was unfair that I couldn’t say it was a misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the meantime, Jo Jincheol intervened again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What nonsense are you talking about, Reinheit! You said you only followed the goddess of beauty around, but now your eyes have become distorted. Archangel? A good story? Where can you read stories like that from this guy! This guy is a talent of the 'Black Cloud Foundation'! Hey, ignore that nonsense! I’ll write a letter of recommendation myself!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A-a letter of recommendation from an Ascendant!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don’t know much about letters of recommendation, but it seems to be a great privilege here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The examiner nodded happily as if he had read my expression and explained.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You’re still a newbie, so you don’t know much, but if you get a letter of recommendation and join, you should be able to become eligible for Ascension in at least 5 years depending on your efforts. Even if you learn [Black Flame Spring]…!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In short, it was a story that the time it would take to become the Black Flame Dragon’s footstool would be shortened from 10 years to 5 years.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What an incredible benefit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was about to readily express my intention to decline, but this time Reinheit intervened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you join our &lt;Olympus Technology&gt;, we will put you on the Ascension Platform within 3 years."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"3 years! Oh my god!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don’t know for sure, but there must be a heated debate going on inside the [Fourth Wall] about 'Becoming an Olympus Slave vs. Becoming a Black Flame Dragon Footstool' right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It doesn’t end here. If you become an Ascendant, I will personally recommend you as the incarnation of the Twelve Gods of &lt;Olympus&gt;."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The room was filled with shock. Olympus's Twelve Seats.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I didn't know much about &lt;Olympus&gt;, it would have been a tempting suggestion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh my! Is the Paradise Emperor sincere?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If it's the Paradise Emperor, then it's possible. I heard that the Paradise Emperor was also selected as an incarnation candidate for one of the Twelve Seats this time."</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time, I was a little surprised.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That Reinheit is the incarnation of one of the Twelve Seats?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall', activates!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I instinctively felt wary.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Reinheit was a terminal incarnation directly connected to the &lt;Olympus&gt; Twelve Seats, then this situation was dangerous.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Olympus&gt; had clashed with me several times in the 'Recycling Center' and the 'Fear Realm'. Even if it had been quite some time, if it was a Twelve Seats-level, they might recognize my identity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, the sky above the Ascension Platform was rippling ominously. Intermittent sparks began to flow around Reinheit's brainwashing window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly turned my hood over and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Excuse me, but I have a different company I would like to join."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The examiner, startled by my words, asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh? What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked around the room. The incarnations gathered here were each wearing uniforms with different company symbols or names on them. However, no matter how much I searched, I couldn't find the company name I was looking for.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You're crazy. You're looking for another company when you have the ascendants of &lt;Black Cloud Foundation&gt; and &lt;Olympus Technology&gt; right in front of you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you a kid who still can't see?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I was going to be the Black Flame Dragon's footstool or the terminal incarnation of &lt;Olympus&gt; in the first place, I wouldn't have gone through all that trouble and come this far.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While everyone else was making expressions of bewilderment, only Reinheit was looking at me with profound eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Interesting. You rejected &lt;Black Cloud Foundation&gt; and &lt;Olympus Technology&gt; and chose the 'third option'? Somehow, a famous anecdote comes to mind."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heh heh. Keuhahahaha!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jo Jincheol burst into laughter as well. I wondered what was so funny about my answer. Then, Jo Jincheol stopped laughing for a moment and looked at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You, do you think you can be a 'Kim Dokja'?"</p>
