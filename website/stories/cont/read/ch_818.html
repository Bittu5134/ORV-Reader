<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The two chose a &#39;different ending&#39; from the others. It was obvious what ending they chose.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The two would head to &#39;the world where Kim Dokja is&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye licked her lips.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then...we won&#39;t be able to see each other anymore?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah hesitated for a moment before answering.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s not certain. It&#39;s similar to the fact that the world line branched off. We might meet again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s not certain either, is it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah didn&#39;t answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye muttered, accepting the silence as affirmation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If we had made that choice...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then we wouldn&#39;t have met the ahjussi of the 41st round.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung&#39;s strong voice cut off Lee Jihye&#39;s words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Heewon-unnie and Hyunsung-ahjussi chose the best for themselves, and we chose the best for ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">No one in the group blamed Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung. Rather, they hoped that they would be happy for having made different choices.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fact that each of the group chose different endings was simply a matter of how they understood Kim Dokja. The &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; they chose was different, but the fact that they all liked Kim Dokja remained the same.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe that&#39;s the same for Dokja ahjussi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The group responded to Shin Yoosoung&#39;s words. They all stared at the screen on the wall. The records of the &#39;Recycling Center&#39; were flowing out on the screen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now, the 41st Kim Dokja, who has become the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His squinted eyes, which made it impossible to tell what he wanted to see or where he was looking, were reflected all over the screen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If that&#39;s ahjussi&#39;s choice and the world he wanted to see...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even without saying more, everyone already knew what she would say next.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe we&#39;re characters who don&#39;t fit in this story.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The one who broke the deep, short silence that had fallen for a moment was Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re still saying such pathetic things. I&#39;m not curious about what kind of story he wants to see.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why is the master trying to intervene in that story?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#39;s find that guy who made things so complicated...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it because Yoo Jonghyuk has changed a little now that he doesn&#39;t say until the end that he will kill him?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk frowned as if he didn&#39;t like the original price and looked back at Yoo Sangah and urged her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What about the second news? Didn&#39;t you say you have two things to tell us?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">She already said one piece of news. The whereabouts of Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was still one more thing left.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead of telling the remaining one right away, Yoo Sangah looked at the group and said this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I also agree with what Jonghyuk-ssi said. I respect the life of Dokja-ssi, but I think it&#39;s too early for us to give up.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you think we still have a role to play, Unnie?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t know about that...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah continued speaking while looking at the squinted eyes of Kim Dokja, who was slowly growing bigger in the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If this world is the dream that Dokja-ssi is dreaming, I think there must be a place for us too. I don’t know if it’s a villain or a good guy.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If it’s Sooyoung, I think she’ll use us as villains.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Seolhwa added cheerfully, and the group smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah nodded and continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The second news is about Han Sooyoung.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Is Sooyoung awake?”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung hadn’t woken up since fighting the Outer God to save Kim Dokja in the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Not yet.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Really? Where is Sooyoung right now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t know exactly, but… It seems certain that something happened to Sooyoung.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah took out her notebook from her bosom. Everyone here knew what the notebook was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Han Sooyoung&#39;s notebook.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung used it to write the story of Kim Dokja and &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the moment when the eyes of the group were filled with longing, Yoo Sangah, who had picked up the notebook, opened a file.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story of Kim Dokja that Han Sooyoung had written some time ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Familiar letters that they hadn&#39;t seen in a long time were unfolding before their eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the condition of the manuscript was strange.</p>
「◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️…」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The content was covered in noise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;W, why is it like this all of a sudden? Is the computer broken?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#39;t just a feeling of a breakdown. Yoo Jonghyuk said, checking the sparks fluttering faintly on the manuscript.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The story is contaminated.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Story contamination. It was a symptom that often appeared in old stories. The context of the story becomes tangled or parts are lost.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what does it mean that the contamination occurred in this manuscript of all things?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;When did it start like this?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Since the start of the 41st round.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What caused it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah sighed lightly at Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s question and opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;From now on, it&#39;s my hypothesis, so don&#39;t take it too seriously.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Tell me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You all know how this world works, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye nodded, scratching her cheek.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, Sooyoung-unnie explained it to me once before...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I heard that Sooyoung-unnie wrote about Jonghyuk-ssi, and that Dokja read it, and that&#39;s how the world came to exist. Isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye tilted her head at Shin Yoosoung&#39;s words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then does that mean that Sooyoung wrote the book first and that this world existed?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No. Sooyoung went back in time and wrote the book based on the things that happened with Dokja-hyung, so Dokja-hyung read it first.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you talking about? How can he read a book that no one wrote?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He can read it because he&#39;s a god.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah said, stopping the bickering children.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There&#39;s no point in measuring who&#39;s late and who&#39;s early. As you know, this world is made so that you can&#39;t tell the beginning and the end.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">One day, Han Sooyoung said something similar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This world is a &#39;square circle&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A world that exists only as a &#39;text&#39; that humans cannot imagine, with a continuity that is impossible in terms of time and space.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So what does that mean?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;A story that starts later can be placed on a faster timeline.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A story that starts later can be faster. The group already knew the example of that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Like Jonghyuk’s 1,863rd round.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The story of Kim Dokja, who existed after the &#39;Ways of Survival&#39;, changing Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s last round.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Seolhwa nodded as if she understood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is something similar happening in the 41st round right now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s right. To be exact...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah scrolled down and turned the pages of the manuscript.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 3, chapter 4…</p>
<p class="orv_line">The pages that kept turning stopped at some point.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Chapter 551. That was the last chapter of Kim Dokja and &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; written by Han Sooyoung, and the end of that world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the moment she turned the next manuscript.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A page that had never existed before appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The bewildered group asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait a minute. What is this?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The manuscript that had clearly been blank after the conclusion was filled in with letters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The story of the 41st round is being written.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is Sooyoung-unnie writing the latter part?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even the manuscript was being written and erased repeatedly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Han Sooyoung had said that she would always be a writer for one person, there was a possibility that she was continuing to write this manuscript somewhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Some parts seem to have been written by Sooyoung. But not all parts are like that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There was someone else who wrote the manuscript besides Sooyoung?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;When you read it, the writing style is not consistent in each part. The theme is also subtly different. I don&#39;t know how to express it exactly, but...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah paused for a moment to think about her words before opening her mouth again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It looks like several writers are competing over a single manuscript.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk thought for a moment and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who and why did they do that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t know that much, but this is what I think.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah read the latest sentences that were being written in real time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the lines being written in real time, Yoo Sangah thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this something she&#39;s writing because she&#39;s saying it? Or is it something she&#39;s saying because it&#39;s already been written?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There are people who want to steal the &#39;stories&#39; we&#39;ve built.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It didn&#39;t matter either way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What was certain was that this gave her and &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; something to do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;To be exact, I&#39;m talking about 『Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint』 written by Sooyoung.&quot;</p>
<hr>
【Do you really think he&#39;s qualified to be a &#39;recorder&#39;?】</p></div>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I read Han Sooyoung&#39;s 『Guide to Fear Spirits That Even Squid and Sunfish Can Understand』 with Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the title suggests, It was a &#39;setting book&#39; written in easy-to-understand sentences.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there was one catch.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>*Viewing this document has been prohibited by SVRP.</p>
<p>SVRP. PW 0.</p>
<p>◼️◼️ ◼️◼️◼️ ◼️</p>
<p>◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️…</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Similar traces remained throughout the book. It felt as if multiple editors had intervened in a single manuscript and modified or deleted parts here and there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">— It seems like someone edited the manuscript written by Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja had a similar opinion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The question is who would do such a thing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, we had a hard time guessing the answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">— They must probably be someone who records &#39;fear&#39;.</p>
「Recorder of Fear.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But why did they touch Han Sooyoung&#39;s manuscript?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why was this manuscript in [Fourth Wall] in the first place?</p>
<p class="orv_line">As of now, there were almost no clues that could be guessed. Since there were no clues, it was time to read what we could find out</p>
<p class="orv_line">—though there was no time to read everything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But let&#39;s take a look at the basics one by one.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Kim Dokja was next to me, he would have smiled his signature grin. I could picture it. We are the second-best type addicts in this universe, so</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What should we check first?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—We need to first examine which fears are weak and which are strong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If we don&#39;t want to die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s what I said, but in fact, there was another reason.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who are we? Aren&#39;t we just fragments of Kim Dokja, who drew &#39;Ways of Survival Power Balance Diagrams&#39; during every break?</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to the &#39;Guide to Fear Spirits that Even a Squid and SunfishCan Understand&#39;, the &#39;fear&#39; of fear spirits is broadly defined into four levels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fear of a catastrophe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fear of a disaster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fear of a natural disaster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fear of the end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;traffic lights&#39; and &#39;uniformity&#39; of that I encountered before are the most primitive fears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a &#39;catastrophe-level&#39;.</p>
「Catastrophe-level fear refers to &#39;fear&#39; that regularly causes deaths of at least 0 to 50 people.」</p></div>
「The cause of catastrophe-level fear is mainly a mutated narrative-grade &#39;story&#39;.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It was based on a story after all.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was only then that the overall picture of the terror began to gradually become clear.</p>
「This public forum is made up of a huge &#39;discarded story&#39;.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The stories that were not properly covered in the main story, those stories came together to form one huge world, and that is this &#39;public forum&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, it felt like a cluster of letters waiting for the surrounding pale darkness to be called out.</p>
「Disaster-level fear refers to a &#39;fear&#39; that causes regular or irregular deaths of at least 50 to 10,000 people.」</p></div>
「The cause of disaster-level fear is mainly a mutated &#39;legendary story&#39;.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Disaster-level fear is a legendary story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So that means that &#39;shark head&#39;, or &#39;tooth fin&#39;, is a fear based on a legendary story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I looked back, the tooth fin stopped and shook its large tail, looking at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know why, but right after eating the story I gave it, it had been following me at a certain distance. Fortunately, it didn&#39;t seem to have any hostile intentions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued reading the book. I read it.</p>
「A natural disaster level fear refers to a level of &#39;fear&#39; that causes a whole world to go crazy.」</p></div>
「The cause of a natural disaster level fear is mainly a mutated &#39;quasi-mythical-grade story.&#39;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">According to the records, the &#39;Tooth Fin&#39; that tried to destroy Murim was also temporarily recorded as a &#39;natural disaster level.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the destruction of Murim is a &#39;natural disaster level,&#39; then what about the next level, &#39;Jongyeon level,&#39; will it be? Will Jaehwan-ssi, an outsider, appear?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unfortunately, most of the descriptions about &#39;Jongyeon level fear&#39; were covered with ◼️.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seems that the recorders of this contest controlled the description, and it seems that they couldn&#39;t control all the descriptions in the picture, so there was one piece of advice that I was grateful for.</p>
「The Jongyeon level fear is loyal to the &#39;end area,&#39; and no matter what happens, it will never enter the &#39;beginning area.&#39;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If Han Sooyoung wrote this much...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—She means you absolutely must not go.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Since it&#39;s so clear, I feel like I&#39;ll definitely go, so I&#39;m worried.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That&#39;s always the case with Ways of Survival.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Can&#39;t you at least tell me that I don&#39;t have to go?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja giggled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—But you still have to go to the middle area. That&#39;s how you can find the second.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The middle area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in the beginning area, there&#39;s a monster like &#39;Tooth Fin&#39;, so if I go to the middle area, there&#39;ll definitely be something worse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Can&#39;t I just call him again?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—No.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why? Did you fight with the second?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That&#39;s...</p>
<p class="orv_line">It must be because of the reason he mentioned before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation said so. The other Kim Dokjas didn&#39;t agree with the &#39;First Kim Dokja&#39;s&#39; intentions. If that&#39;s the case, there must have been some kind of misunderstanding and conflict. It&#39;s important to resolve that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is what I think. Kim Dokja and Kim Dokja need to talk.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That&#39;s a good point.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So let&#39;s talk.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—He has to answer the phone to talk. I told you that you can&#39;t make a phone call here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It worked just now, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That&#39;s okay because he called, but if we want to call, we have to go somewhere else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Where else?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You already know that place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a moment and then asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is it the time fault in the dark dimension?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That&#39;s right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is that the place?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The place where the Supreme King Yoo Jonghyuk, the fallen swordsman Namgung Minyoung, and the paradoxical Baekcheong Kyrgios were reborn as &#39;transcendents&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The cradle and grave of the martial artists who dream of the stars in the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The entrance to that place is from the &#39;mid-region&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, I have to get to the mid-region anyway.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it was far away. I had passed countless traffic lights and all sorts of catastrophic horrors on my way here. I had almost died several times. How many more times would I have to go through something similar in the future? Should I experience it?</p>
[A &#39;Nameless Fear&#39; has found you!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That was when a bright light shone from afar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A long object approached with a dull roar and a rattling sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wait, that thing…</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Hmm. That’s it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A subway was running in the darkness without even a railroad.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you think about it, there is a world where fear related to &#39;traffic lights&#39; exists, so it’s not strange that there is fear related to the &#39;subway&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That’s certainly understandable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was the announcement that came with the approaching subway.</p>
【We will do our best to make the subway a comfortable and convenient place that puts the safety of our customers first.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard the announcement, my bones throbbed and my stomach rumbled.</p>
【Passengers heading to…, please take this train.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The appearance of the train seemed somehow familiar. The moment we saw the train name brightly shining on the front, Kim Dokja and I muttered at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Really. It&#39;s driving me crazy.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I agree.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That train was the very same train that Kim Dokja and Yoo Jonghyuk rode in the &#39;First Scenario.&#39;</p>
