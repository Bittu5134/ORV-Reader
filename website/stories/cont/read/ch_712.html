            <div class="orv_title"><h1>712 Episode 26 Star Ladder (8)</h1>712 Episode 26 Star Ladder (8)</div>
<p class="orv_line">The sky was changing in real time. It was pitch black, then white, then there was thunder, then rain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">On the other side of an unpredictable weather event, beyond the swaying void curtain, supreme beings were shaking the universe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What on earth is going on over there?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Has Yoo Jonghyuk really appeared and is grabbing the constellations and stomping them?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Oh, youngest. There&#x27;s a piece of story of quality falling over there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">41st round Yoo Jonghyuk’s head hung on my shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was really going on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the being over there is really Yoo Jonghyuk, why didn&#x27;t he appear here in the form of a possessed person like Shin Yoosoung? Just as Shin Yoosoung used herself in the 41st round, he could also use himself in the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That’s bullshit. If that kid comes here, he&#x27;ll be in big trouble.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Why? If Yoo Jonghyuk comes, we can wipe them all out, right?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Why do you think Yoo Jonghyuk will help us?</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I felt a tingling sensation in the back of my head. As I was only thinking about Shin Yoosoung&#x27;s case, I forgot for a moment what the original purpose of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to Han Sooyoung’s memories, the purpose of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; is to retrieve Kim Dokja. </p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe my presence was a distraction to them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It would be nice if the Earth didn&#x27;t explode like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;No, but still...&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I always think about it, but Kim Dokja&#x27;s impression of Yoo Junghyuk was a bit crooked. How could Yoo Jonghyuk have even done something like that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, it was true that I was worried at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If, like Han Sooyoung, Yoo Jonghyuk also tries to get Kim Dokja back in the form of &#x27;quickly destroying this world&#x27;...</p>
<p class="orv_line">—But shouldn’t you run fast?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Right. Now is not the time to leisurely think about such things.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because even now, the incarnations of the giant nebulae were chasing me in real time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Tear off his legs!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Tear him limb from limb!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why on earth are they running and saying things like that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, I just think that I should never get caught. But I quickly ran out of breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You need to do some exercise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;It&#x27;s refreshing to hear something like that from someone who was </p>
<p class="orv_line">born weak.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You can’t do that. Let&#x27;s borrow it one more time.</p>

<p class="orv_line">I seemed to feel a stronger overlap with Kim Dokja, and [Way of the Wind] wrapped around my toes, covering over a hundred meters in an instant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In reality, if I had competed in the Olympics, I would have set a new record right away, but right now, even this wasn&#x27;t enough.</p>

<p class="orv_line">These guys are really persistent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">‘Constellation-nim! Back! Back!&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A dizzying sensation felt in the back of the head. As Kim Dokja reflexively twisted his head, a breathtaking beam of light passed by his earlobe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Arrow? Or a spear?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, if I had been a little late, I would have had a hole in the back of my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Left!&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment he urgently changed direction, an arrow aimed at a blind spot hit his thigh. Fortunately, it was not me who was hit, but Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You said it’s on the left? It came from the right!</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;It looks like it came from the right too!&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim D okja pulled out the arrow and fired the broken arrow behind him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of an arrow loaded with [Way of the Wind] piercing something was heard, and a scream rang out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But neither Kim Dokja nor I looked back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Youngest. That.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I checked the ladder hanging in the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Star Ladder.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the road leading to the &#x27;eighth scenario&#x27; that I checked as soon as I arrived in the eastern Washington area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;You said I shouldn&#x27;t use that?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—No way, surviving is the priority now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;How do you use it?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead of answering, Kim Dokja raised his right hand with all his might and shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I call the Star Ladder!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s simple, I think.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Star Ladder&#x27; does not respond to you.]</div>['Star Ladder' does not respond to you.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn it, then that&#x27;s right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is no way the scenario with Kim Dokja would be that smooth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What was absurd was that, except for us, all other incarnations were moving on to the next scenario through the &#x27;star ladder&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Jump out! If you get caught up in here, you’ll die!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will call the Star Ladder!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations ran away to the next scenario through the &#x27;star ladder&#x27; amidst a proliferation of giant nebulae.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although the shape, size, and degree of damage to each ladder were different, the ladders came down to everyone except us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Why can&#x27;t we just come down the ladder?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps Kim Dokja was in the midst of looking into it, too, when he faintly heard a message from a conversation with Bihyung in his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Constellation. So now... with authority...</p>
<p class="orv_line">authority?</p>

<p class="orv_line">I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not the only one who&#x27;s stupid.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked Kim Dokja without any expectations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Constellation-nim. Don&#x27;t you have ladder permission?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Are you sure?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Do you have a friend I could ask for?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Are you sure?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;So what happens now?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Just wait a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;They all came after me?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before I knew it, the incarnations were forming a circle and narrowing the siege.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Incarnations of &lt;Olympus&gt;, &lt;Ghost&gt;, &lt;Guardian Tree&gt;, and &lt;Veda&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We&#x27;ve caught him! Surround him slowly!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging from what it felt like, there were no people with narrative-grade sponsors.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They are all incarnations of great-grade constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">These were all guys who had raised their synchronization rate to the limit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This scenario is subject to the rules of &#x27;probability&#x27;. However, if the number of constellations that raised the synchronization rate to the limit increased, it was normal for the scale to naturally fall out of balance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;If this is the case, shouldn&#x27;t someone come help us?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk, or even another member &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; since Kim Dokja said no for Yoo Jonghyuk earlier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At least one person can come.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Do you think a hundred bugs weigh the same as a lion?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized how great &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; had become.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What a bug. Still, those guys are also constellations of their own.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Giant nebulae aren&#x27;t stupid either. It&#x27;s all calculated based on probability. The proof is that there are so many incarnations, but they don&#x27;t have any narrative-grade sponsor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Does that mean they are also adjusting the probability in their own way?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sighed lightly and counted their numbers. Even at first glance, their number is well over thirty.</p>
<p class="orv_line">On the other hand, this side was now at its limit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My body, strengthened with &#x27;Dragon Heart&#x27;, was reduced to rags as soon as it was used with the power of Cheok Jungyeong, and [Bookmark]’s time limit was exhausted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If that Thebes were to stab me with the tip of a spear, my body would collapse. Now the only one I can trust is Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Youngest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Yes.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Earn some time and say something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Yes?&#x27;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill &#x27;Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint&#x27; Lv.3 is deactivated.]</div>[Exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' Lv.3 is deactivated.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was absurd.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, if you leave it like this, what will happen to me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hurriedly thought of &#x27;Thoughts of almost everything&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What items are useful right now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#x27;Poison Bomb&#x27; has already been used up so there is no more, so should we try hiding using the &#x27;Everchanging Stealth Suit&#x27;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Or should I at least use [Incite]?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, the incarnations that were closing the distance stopped with about ten meters left.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking closely, I saw that they were also keeping each other in check.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One of the incarnations, who had been spewing out threats and killing intent to me, opened his mouth first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;&lt;Olympus&gt;. You didn’t forget your promise, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the Halloween party-like costume, it is an incarnation belonging to &lt;Ghost House&gt;. The answer was the &#x27;Gatekeeper of Thebes&#x27; from &lt;Olympus&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don’t worry. You’ll get your share as well. The mythical-grade constellations have just concluded an agreement.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When the &#x27;Gatekeeper of Thebes&#x27; answered, the incarnations of &lt;Ghost&gt; looked at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then everyone shares equally.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Eat? What do you eat?</p>
<p class="orv_line">You should ask my doctor too, you bastards.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I watched the guys approaching me step by step, I gathered my strength once again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like I was relying too much on my sponsor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now I have to do some work too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I am Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I began, slightly twisting my lips.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;A lot of people have gathered. But what happened in your &#x27;Ginnungagap&#x27; and is it like this?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don’t listen to him. He’s just trying to kill time. Now—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aren’t you curious? Why did &#x27;Valkyrie’s Daughter&#x27; end up like that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;At most, he dealt with one great- grade...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, I don’t know these kids very well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grinned and snapped my fingers in the air. Of course, I didn&#x27;t have to snap my fingers, but I just did it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Now, for the first time in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;, the inside of &#x27;Ginnungagap&#x27; is revealed.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story of a tale whose name has not yet been decided begins!]</div>[The story of a tale whose name has not yet been decided begins!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">My story, whose name has not yet been revealed, began to speak. Then, as if they had been waiting, I heard a message from the constellations.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Prisoner of the Golden Headband&#x27; is viewing the tale!]</div>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is viewing the tale!]</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[A few constellations are surprised after reading your story!]</div>[A few constellations are surprised after reading your story!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Originally, &#x27;Ginnungagap&#x27;  was a stage where no records of any stories were left.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, I was able to leave a story safely thanks to the effect of &#x27;Recorder of Things That Will Disappear’.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the Nebula &lt;Asgard&gt; are astonished.]</div>[The constellations of the Nebula <Asgard> are astonished.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The nebula &lt;Asgard&gt; requests the management to restrict access to the records!]</div>[The nebula <Asgard> requests the management to restrict access to the records!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The truth about &#x27;Ginnungagap&#x27; is spreading widely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Asgard&gt;&#x27;s disgraceful behavior to catch me was quickly spreading throughout the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Asgard&gt; belatedly started to block it, but the constellations had already read the story that was heard infrequently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Gatekeeper of Thebes, is that true?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">One of the incarnations of the &lt;Guardian Tree&gt;, who had been silent the entire time, asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That guy took care of ten great-grade constellations who used half-descent?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It doesn’t make sense… It can’t be like that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Didn’t &#x27;Valkyrie’s Daughter&#x27; go out alone?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some incarnations take a step back. A hole was opened in the circular siege of the incarnations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could vividly feel the stirring of the constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t miss the opportunity and took a step forward.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill &#x27;Incite Lv.10&#x27; is activated.]</div>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.10' is activated.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Now you know who you guys are dealing with.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The surprised incarnations took a step back one after another.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Gatekeeper of Thebes&#x27;, who realized that the atmosphere was unusual, shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s bullshit! Don’t be fooled! Even if that story is true, he has already used up all of his strength in &#x27;Ginnungagap&#x27;. If we join forces and kill him now—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I burst out laughing. The gatekeeper of Thebes silently fell silent due to that maniacal laughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It seems like you didn’t understand even though I gave you a chance.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You, what—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I killed ten great-grade constellations in the seventh scenario. And the story I’ve accumulated hasn’t been given a &#x27;name&#x27; yet. Don’t you know what this means?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw a few quick-witted incarnations rolling their eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An unnamed tale.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, my story wasn&#x27;t &#x27;complete&#x27; yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you help me here, you will be able to receive a share of the tale I will receive.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A very small number of constellations are surprised by the proposal of the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27;.]</div>[A very small number of constellations are surprised by the proposal of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">A confused silence fell among the bustling constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They came here to join forces to eliminate the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; and obtain’ &#x27;Kim Dokja’s Fragment&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, looking at their expressions, the majority of people here did not yet understand exactly what &#x27;Kim Dokja’s Fragment&#x27; was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Choose. Either attack me foolishly and get kicked out of the scenario without even getting your money’s worth.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">They now have another option.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Or maybe you will join hands with me and share a story that is definitively &#x27;legendary&#x27; or higher.&quot;</p>
