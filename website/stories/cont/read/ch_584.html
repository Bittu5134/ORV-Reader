<p class="orv_line">Episode 6. Star Relic</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I still didn&#39;t know much about web novels, I briefly attended a web novel academy</p>
<p class="orv_line">because of Ji Eunyoo&#39;s recommendation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The instructor was a writer who flavored a generation of genre literature.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He had a quiet, nervous voice and spoke very slowly, which is why I dozed off during the entire</p>
<p class="orv_line">class.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, one thing he said stuck with me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#39;t hesitate to include chances, the more the merrier. Give them to the main character.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The instructor who used to live by those words disappeared from my life. I often imagined that</p>
<p class="orv_line">maybe he transmigrated to the novel he wrote.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just like me now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I-I-it&#39;s real! Inho-ssi! It&#39;s real!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It is.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who would have thought that I would be the one to retrieve the chance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein let out a scream of delight, shaking the box and turning it upside down several times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How did you know? It doesn&#39;t say anything about this in Omniscient Reader!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be honest, I was just as confused.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This box was an item in the &#39;preliminary manuscript&#39; of chapter 23 of Omniscient Reader.</p>
「An item described in the manuscript that was left out on draft 2.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, the settings existed, so I looked it up just in case, and the item was indeed there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Here&#39;s the question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this were setting for &#39;Ways of Survival&#39;, then of course Kim Dokja would have used this box in</p>
<p class="orv_line">the original novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, since Kim Dokja didn&#39;t use it, it means that this &#39;box&#39; is not mentioned in the text of</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Ways of Survival&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So since when has this setting been around?</p>
<p class="orv_line">From the moment I thought of it? From the moment Han Sooyoung handed me the manuscript?</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The more I thought about it, the more my head spun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this really the &#39;41st round&#39; of the Ways of Survival that I know?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For now, we have the item, so let&#39;s just think about that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I replied to Kyung Sein.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It just occurred to me that this box was originally an item made by a dokkaebi and then</p>
<p class="orv_line">discarded.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The box, which was dangerous enough to unbalance the scenario, was once an item in the</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bureau designed by a mad dokkaebi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Uh...... that&#39;s right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But did they really just dump that one item...... only one in the same place?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow, really. Wow.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">After hearing my explanation, Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi each grabbed their knifes and</p>
<p class="orv_line">started poking around the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, they wouldn&#39;t find another box.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are only two of these box.</p>
[Some constellations are shocked to discover the existence of the item.]</p></div>
[A few constellations protest, asking when they released such an item.]</p></div>
[A very small number of constellations start to point out the probability problem.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A few constellations started to protest, but Bihyung doesn&#39;t seem to have gotten the memo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered what would happen if we closed the channel and ran away like in the original story,</p>
<p class="orv_line">but I was glad.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I needed to see the reactions of the constellations.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Prisoner of the Golden Headband&#39; is interested in your luck.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Rice Cake-Eating Tiger&#39; asks if that box is real.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39; widens its eyes in disbelief.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In this world, there are countless &#39;readers&#39;, including me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From what I&#39;ve learned in the fight against the Misreading Association, readers are possessing</p>
<p class="orv_line">not only incarnations, but also constellations.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Primordial Cow&#39; taps its chin with its forefoot.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked carefully at the indirect messages from the constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If any of them were readers, they would surely unwittingly drop clues.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Pig Living in a Brick House&#39; piles up bricks.]</p></div>
[A constellation who hasn&#39;t revealed their modifier tells you to enter the box.]</p></div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I observed each subsequent message, trying to figure out who they were.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One that looks like a normal constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One that looks like it was possessed by a reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One I couldn&#39;t tell if it was a reader or a constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One that is possessed by a reader, but remains true to the concept of a constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One that is possessed by a reader that doesn&#39;t understand the concept of constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just plain weird and so on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, this is all speculation on my part.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But hey, what can you really tell from one line of indirect messages?</p>
<p class="orv_line">They&#39;ve all been reading Omniscient Reader so it shouldn&#39;t take much to convince for them to act</p>
<p class="orv_line">like constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way...... Where&#39;s Sneaking Schemer?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was most curious about that guy&#39;s reaction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I guess that&#39;s the only box, I can&#39;t find anything else.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi were still digging.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ugh...... well, we have one. It&#39;s too bad we don&#39;t have a Broken Faith, because that&#39;s all we need</p>
<p class="orv_line">for Unbroken Faith!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Kyung Sein said, we would only need that, but I couldn&#39;t get my hands on a Broken Faith</p>
<p class="orv_line">right away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So I made a decision.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about it, and since we&#39;re at this point, why don&#39;t we try something different?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Something different?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pulled out an item I had just gotten from near the box.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Item information&gt;</p>
<p>Name: Unformed Idea</p>
<p>Rating: D</p>
<p>Description: A shapeless weapon of the past. It could have been anything, but ultimately became</p>
<p>nothing.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">An item that, at first glance, looks like spoiled jelly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you don&#39;t mind, I was wondering if I could put this item in.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is...... Isn&#39;t this an item that didn&#39;t appear in Omniscient Reader?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Right. It&#39;s probably not used in Ways of Survival either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja wasn&#39;t particularly interested in this item either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein glanced at the Unformed Idea and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, we wouldn&#39;t have found the box if it weren&#39;t for you, Inho-ssi, so it&#39;s up to you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think so too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow, we&#39;re becoming a bit like the &#39;Kim Dokja&#39;s Company&#39;, aren&#39;t we?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Haha, I guess so.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The two of them conceded so readily, I almost felt rather sorry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thank you then.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Without further ado, I put &#39;Unformed Idea&#39; into the &#39;random item box&#39;.</p>
[A constellation who hasn&#39;t revealed their modifier says it&#39;s a risky choice.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I know it&#39;s a risky choice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was a chance of failure no matter what I put in there in the first place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Now I need to get the starting material.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s the core of a demon species, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order to use the box like in the original, we need to put the target item and the Demon Species</p>
<p class="orv_line">Core together.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unfortunately, we failed to hunt the Dark Keeper, a 7th grade demon species.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For now, it&#39;s best to use the auction to get one...... but I don&#39;t know what kind of madman would</p>
<p class="orv_line">risk a demon king curse to hunt a demonic species from the beginning.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Rice Cake-Eating Tiger&#39; asks if you need a &#39;Demon Species Core&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">We look up in surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What was even more surprising was its next words.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Rice Cake-Eating Tiger&#39; says that it can give you the &#39;Demon Species Core&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who was looking at the air with us, asked in a reminiscent voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Rice Cake-Eating Tiger is the one from the traditional fairy tale, right? &#39;The Sun and the</p>
<p class="orv_line">Moon&#39;.......&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because that&#39;s the only fairy tale that comes to mind when I think of Korean &#39;Rice Cake-Eating</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tigers&#39;.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Rice Cake-Eating Tiger&#39; says it&#39;s him.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">constellation.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Peninsula.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">To get an item sponsored by a constellation from the beginning. Even Kim Dok-ja had never</p>
<p class="orv_line">received such a sponsorship at this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he&#39;s sponsoring items so early on, he has a reason to do so.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Demon Species Core&#39;.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I appreciate the offer, but.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Normally, this kind of deal would be followed by a ridiculous request.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s Kim Dokja&#39;s proverb.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Zodiacs Ball&#39; later.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Twelve Zodiacs Ball?</p>
[The constellation &#39;Rice Cake-Eating Tiger&#39; says it&#39;s just a twelve zodiacs social event.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This was another unexpected suggestion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Twelve Zodiacs Ball.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s probably the zodiacal version of the &#39;Constellation Banquet&#39; or the &#39;Gourmet Association&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As they listened to the message, Kyung Sein and ahjussi whispered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow, it&#39;s the &lt;Twelve Zodiacs&gt;.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They&#39;re the rat, cow, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, chicken, dog, and pig.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Right?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s...... right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;When I was young, there was a cartoon movie with twelve zodiacs as the main characters.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the original version of the Omniscient Reader, the constellations of the nebula &lt;Twelve</p>
<p class="orv_line">Zodiacs&gt; were the enemies of Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But this time, the situation is a little different.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Is it because I&#39;m a villain?</p>
[The constellation &#39;Rice Cake-Eating Tiger&#39; says there&#39;s no need to feel pressured.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I&#39;ve made my decision.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;ll attend the Twelve Zodiacs Ball. Is that really all I have to do?&quot;</p>
[The constellation &#39;Rice Cake-Eating Tiger&#39; says that&#39;s really it.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Okay, then.&quot;</p>
[The constellation &#39;Rice Cake-Eating Tiger&#39; is greatly pleased.]</p></div>
[A &#39;7th grade Demon Species Core&#39; has been sponsored.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a very cool sponsorship.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A pitch black colored orb then appeared from thin air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;7th grade Demon Species Core&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was even superior in color.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsuchuchuchut.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging from the faint sparks, it seemed that &#39;Rice Cake-Eating Tiger&#39; had taken quite the</p>
<p class="orv_line">probability.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What is he up to showing such sincerity to me when I&#39;m not even his own incarnation?</p>
[The constellation &#39;Primordial Cow&#39; is sharing the probability of &#39;Rice Cake-Eating Tiger&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Tiger&#39;.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cake-Eating Tiger&#39;.]</p>
[The constellation &#39;Prisoner of the Golden Headband&#39; claps his hands at the animal brothers.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, thanks to the animal friends, I have been gathered all the ingridients.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the glowing core, Kyung Sein said excitedly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, go ahead and put it in, Inho-ssi!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why don&#39;t the three of us cover it at the same time?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We covered the box.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein chanted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;God! Buddha! Demon King of Salvation! Please!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A moment later, a bright light emanated from the box.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">*</p>
<p class="orv_line">A place dozens of steps away from the core of the &#39;Edge of Darkness&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the center of the deep, black ether of the &#39;Dark Root&#39;, a woman in a white coat stood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">She frowned at the &#39;random item box&#39; glowing in the distance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Even the box was taken? From me? Is that even possible?&quot;</p>
[The constellation &#39;Sneaking Schemer&#39; ask why didn&#39;t you move faster.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who&#39;s that guy?&quot;</p>
[The constellation &#39;Sneaking Schemer&#39; says he seems to be a reader from another world line.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;A reader?&quot;</p>
[The constellation &#39;Sneaking Schemer&#39; says yes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The woman tilted her head at that, then smiled, baring her fangs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Not a guy?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In her hand was a &#39;Broken Faith&#39; that no reader in this world could have gotten.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Author&#39;s Note</p>
<p class="orv_line">You know everything now, right?</p>
