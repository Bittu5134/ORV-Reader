<p class="orv_line">A short while later, we descended into the subway and ate ground rat meat. This was to take advantage of the 'contamination resistance effect' of the meat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We had made beef jerky beforehand at Geumho Station, and it came in handy at times like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What, are you eating alone?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who had just returned from washing her face, took a big bite out of the piece of jerky I was holding and murmured.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did anything fun happen?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Because you all look like you're having fun."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hihihi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein laughed strangely, and even Dansoo ahjussi had a subtle smile on his face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I replied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We were doing some volunteer work."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Volunteer work?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' praises the good deeds of the incarnations.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Well, I wouldn't call it volunteer work, since we got paid.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' says that the spirit of the Korean Peninsula is not dead yet.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the constellation's sudden message, Jung Heewon stared at the air and tilted her head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Bald?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' warns her not to end that sentence.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As it turns out, Jung Heewon was still unfamiliar with concepts like constellation and incarnation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I briefly explained it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I understand roughly what a constellation is. It's like a god, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"So that's why Inho-ssi and the others have repaired the bald...... god's statue?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">An disturbing spark was fluttering over Jung Heewon's head, so I hastily added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He's not a bald god, he's a bald general. His real name is Samyeongdang, and he was a great person in Korea. An excellent man."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' calms down.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Samyeongdang is a Buddhist monk, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, Jung Heewon doesn't know much about Korean history.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tried to think of a way to explain, but Kyung Sein replied instead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Samyeongdang was a monk in the middle of the Joseon Dynasty. During the Japanese Invasion of Korea, he defended the Korean Peninsula by fighting against the Japanese troops."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon's eyes widened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sein is smart."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hehe."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein winked at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, her explanation was an imitation of Yoo Sangah's. It was indeed a masterful response.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"So these are all the items Samyeongdang gave you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Samyeongdang's 'sponsorship'. The shiny bag contained three items.</p>

<h3 class="orv_window_title">[Item Information]</h3>
<p>Name: Damaged Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick</p>
<p>Rating: Star Relic</p>
<p>Description: A star relic of the 'Bald General of Justice', a historical-grade constellation of the Korean Peninsula. Unfortunately, it has been damaged due to poor storage.</p>
<p>As an add-on, it increases Physique by 1 and Magic Power by 1, and provides a significant boost to magic resistance.</p>
<p>It can deal additional damage to ghost species and other heteromorphic monsters.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">This time I couldn't keep my mouth shut.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I never thought I'd get another star relic.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An item that even Kim Dokja thought about but never actually got.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' shrugs it off.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I suppose that means our actions pleased Samyeongdang.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know who broke the statue, but I'm very grateful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's distribute the items."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first thing I picked up was the Samyeongdang's Straw Mat. In fact, the owner of this item had already been decided.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Me? Why?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who received the straw mat, asked, tilting her head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I thought it would look good on you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who was beside her, nodded enthusiastically.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon looked down at the item hesitantly, but then made up her mind and put on the straw mat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This completed her initial set-up in the 3rd turn, which included 'Samyeongdang's Straw Mat' and the 'ground rat knife'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein was impressed and whispered to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I never thought I'd be able to see Heewon-nim's 'early setting' with my own eyes......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if sensing something, Jung Heewon glanced over suspiciously. We quickly clapped our hands and cheered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It looks good on you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Unni! You look great!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi, who had been standing still, chimed in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You look just like an outlaw in the wilderness."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Really?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon looked back and forth at her reflection in the screen door in disbelief.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For reference, when Kim Dokja saw that scene in the original, he commented.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Actually, no matter how you look at it, it looks like a beggar's blanket. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He may have said that, but he was probably smiling. We watched Jung Heewon's excitement for a moment before deciding who would own the rest of the items.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We decided that Kyung Sein would get the 'Samyeongdang's Beads', which has magic resistance, while Dansoo ahjussi would get the 'Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick', which increases magic stats.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein asked in an apologetic voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you give them all to us, what about Inho-ssi?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm okay. I already have a star relic."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi was overjoyed that he had his first star relic, and he swung the bamboo stick around in the air. He even gave it a name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wilson."</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's weird. I thought the bracelet was named Wilson.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">After completing the preparations, we entered the tunnel heading straight for Chungmuro.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While Dansoo ahjussi was using his [Diverse Communication] to sense the danger ahead, Jung Heewon and Kyung Sein were talking in small voices.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's creepy here. A ghost might come out. I think I hear strange cries as well......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't say that. You can't kill ghosts with a knife."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, it was about time for that 'monster' to come out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this point, I was wondering if I should warn my companions, but then I heard a welcomed message in my ear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—This guy closes his eyes every time he sees me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Bihyung's 'dokkaebi communication'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked up and smirked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I haven't seen you much lately, that's why I closed my eyes.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Are you being sarcastic? Only now could I spare some time. The number of kids doing weird stuff has dropped significantly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The number has dropped significantly. Normally, this would be good news, but this time, it was ominous. I had an idea who the friends who were doing the weird stuff might be.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—And the constellations' situation is weird too...... And what have you done to get cursed by the constellations? Some of them are out to get you these days.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Constellations that are after me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Shit, there they go again. I'm leaving.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, Bihyung turned off the communication again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We have the stream contract, so he came to take care of me for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, the constellations are cursing me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I got a sense of what kind of friends they were.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I'm guessing it's the 'Plague-Carrying Rat' we fought a while back. Maybe there's more people from the Misreading Association possessing constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Stop it. I really hate ghosts."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do I still look like Sein?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The two were still talking about ghosts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By now, we were more than halfway through the tunnel. It was time to get ready.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I unwrapped the 'Thoughts of Almost Everything' from my wrist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was shaped like a bracelet now, but it could mimic any item it touched.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened the list of items that could be mimicked.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<h3 class="orv_window_title">[Possible Mimicry List]</h3>
<p>1. Magic Restoration Bracelet</p>
<p>2. Damaged Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick</p>
<p>.......</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">In preparation for this time, I put a few items on the mimicry list.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Damaged Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick' was a top-rated item, so it had a separate condition, but fortunately, the requirement was to 'have contact with the idea for at least 10 minutes', so I was able to complete it without any problems.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have selected 'Damaged Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The item is top-rated.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The item can be mimicked for 1 hour.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">One hour. That's more than enough.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Thoughts of Almost Everything' refuses to mimic.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This guy could refuse the mimicry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Two long narrow eyes and a mouth appeared on the ring of the bracelet, and a small babbling sound came out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Si-jyo."</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was the only downside to the item ego 'Thoughts of Almost Everything'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't transform it into the shape I needed when I needed it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, I had a solution.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.4' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"From now on, you are the 'Damaged Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick'."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incite is effective!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Jyo—jyo!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a mystic light, the bracelet's form began to change.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Thoughts of Almost Everything' has become 'Damaged Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The duration of the mimicry is 1 hour.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Sure enough, it looked exactly like 'Damaged Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick'. The performance was the same.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is shocked!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' asks if it's a scam.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Surprised, Jung Heewon poked her head over my shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh. That looks exactly like Dansoo ahjussi's item?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I made it for you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What? For me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm not giving it to you, I'm just lending it to you for a while."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon took the bamboo stick, swung it around, and tilted her head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It looks strong. But I have a knife already?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hold on to that. You'll need it. You said earlier that you can't kill ghosts with a knife, but this can kill ghosts."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What's wrong with you, Inho-ssi, really?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm not kidding, something really is going to come out now. Hit everything you see with it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the original, Jung Heewon goes on a rampage in the 'Phantom Prison' just before entering Chungmuro Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's just that they had Kim Dokja and Lee Hyunsung, but if Jung Heewon went on a rampage here, none of us could stop her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's why the 'Damaged Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick' with its magic resistance is a musthave for Jung Heewon at this point.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi already had a premonition of what lay ahead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is everyone ready?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein whispered as she shook the 'Samyeongdang's Beads' on her wrist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's 'Phantom Prison' time now, isn't it? But what are you going to do, Inho-ssi? You don't have any items with magic resistance."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't need them."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time as she said that, something like a fog began to gather around us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Be careful, everyone. It's starting."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The final gateway to Chungmuro has finally begun.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new sub scenario has arrived!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<h3 class="orv_window_title">[Sub Scenario — Phantom Prison]</h3>
<p>Category: Sub</p>
<p>Difficulty: D~F</p>
<p>Clear Conditions: Escape from Phantom Prison within the time limit.</p>
<p>Time Limit: 1 hour</p>
<p>Reward: 300 coins</p>
<p>Failure: ???</p>
</div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Sub scenario — 'Phantom Prison' has begun!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The rising fog quickly covered the tunnel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My sense of space became disoriented, and the figures of Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi, who were right next to me, disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I heard their voices in the distance like a hallucination.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Jiyoon?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"U-uaaa!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Phantom Prison is a space that touches the traumas of incarnations and leads them to madness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Trapped in this fog, the incarnations are forced to face their most horrific memories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sein-ssi! Dansoo ahjussi! Heewon-ssi! Everyone, wake up, it's all an illusion!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shouted, but my voice only echoed in the hollow fog.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only reassuring thing is that everyone in the group is wearing 'magic resistance' items.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They'll be panicking, but they shouldn't have any trouble escaping the 'Phantom Prison'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't have the 'Samyeongdang's Beads', nor do I have 'Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I also don't have the [Fourth Wall] or [Destroy Evil(破魔)] skills like Kim Dokja in the original.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I wasn't worried.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be honest, I was even a little excited to find out what I would see.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Phantom Prison' is experiencing a temporary error!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Because I didn't have any memories that could be called 'traumatic'.</p>
