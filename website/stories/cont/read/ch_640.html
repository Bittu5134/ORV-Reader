<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Anna Croft said.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Jonghyuk. Maybe the regression turns you and I built up were just like a storm in a teacup. Our years of struggling for dozens of rounds couldn't change a single sliver of the night sky."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, Yoo Jonghyuk looked down at the stars in the night sky reflected on the teacup with silent eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"One day, the moment will come when all the stars in the sky will fall and I will be left alone in this world. Even then, if I'm holding this cup."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk emptied all the remaining tea as if swallowing the night sky reflected in the tea water.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"At that time, the world would have changed."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">This was the second time I had seen someone die right in front of my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Whoever reads this story dies.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The brilliance in his eyes dimmed, and his body temperature cooled. It becomes an eye that can no longer read anything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Spirit of Elaine Forest, Holy Oil, Summoning team or whatever.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There’s no use. It's too late.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a wound that could not be revived even if I had an elixir.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, I couldn't stand it if I didn't even think about it. If I don't think like that, I will think of something else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I blankly looked down at my hands. Just before, when I wrote a sentence, my hand was stained red.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Dad."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon said. Jung Heewon spoke in a low voice while holding Sergeant Jung Moonho's hand, which was cold.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wake up. This isn't it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you say that, it's as if he'd really wake up again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Sergeant Jung Moonho could not open his eyes again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story with a 90% success rate of reproduction was reproduced that way.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Sergeant Jung Moonho is dead.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">All I could do was record this moment.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Jung Heewon was crying.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The body of Sergeant Jung Moonho, who had passed away, melted into the demonic energy of the defect explosion and was completely crushed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to ask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did you risk your life for this child?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe I know the answer to why you jumped in for a character you have no connection with.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Because he is a fragment of Kim Dokja.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the place where Sergeant Jung Moonho’s body disappeared, I saw a slowly emerging soul.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Kkoma Kim Dokja.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I witnessed a similar phenomenon when Jung Jaewoo died in the theater dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even then, the pitch-black space split, and the white hand snatched Jung Jaewoo's soul.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What appeared this time was a black hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The black hand that jumped out in an instant seized the soul of the kkoma Kim Dokja as it is, leaving the space.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It disappeared through the cracks of the space.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A white hand last time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A black hand this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't understand. What kind of beings take away the souls of dead readers?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this the RepresentativeKimDokja I saw at the banquet then? Or is it the Outer God that appeared this time?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why were we brought to this world?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「It was finally the ending of the story the reader wanted.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This kind of story that no one would want, why the hell did it have to continue? My vision flickered as if it was dark, and the swirling emotions were sucking me in like sand.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And there was a story that still protected me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Yoo Jonghyuk said. "Okay."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk of 'Ways of Survival' was talking. Listening to Yoo Jonghyuk’s voice, which I don't even know how many times I heard, I managed to get rid of my stomach-churning feeling.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"If you don’t give up, there is a way."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Reading and re-reading that sentence, I muttered to myself as if brainwashing myself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk is right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if their soul is kidnapped by an Outer God, there is a way to get it back.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Like Kim Dokja, who was kidnapped by a 'Secretive Plotter', returned.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who had stopped crying before I knew it, was collecting all the belongings of Sergeant Jung Moonho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi. Is there any way to save him?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">An infinitely calm, still, high-pitched voice. I also gathered my energy and answered her words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I looked up into the air, a message flew in as if it had been waiting for it.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Maritime Admiral' sponsors you 100 coins.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' sponsors you 100 coins.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' sponsors you 100 coins.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' sponsors you 1,000 coins.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' asks what happened to the Outer God.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your first story is about to bloom.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The &lt;Star Stream&gt; is evaluating your first story.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Bounty Scenario - Fight' has ended.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You get a low-grade elixir as a reward.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The reward of the 'Bounty Scenario' that came with a huge coin sponsorship.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately opened the wooden box that came down from the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The elixir contained in the wooden box was something I was familiar with.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Manindan.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will this elixir work even if I give it to him?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately called Bihyung via Dokkaebi communication.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Is the reward worth it? Honestly, it wasn't a scenario that would end with such a reward.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was not a different existence, it was a scenario completed by defeating an Outer God. However, it doesn't make sense to say that the only reward is a 'manindan'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, the answer came right away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It's already being discussed at the management bureau. I also put a word in it. I guess it will take some time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seems that Bihyung is also having a lot of trouble with this 'Outer God' situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Heck, since the Outer World appeared before the fifth scenario even started, there must have been an uproar in the management office by now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who saw the manindan, asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is that a cure?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This alone is not enough."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Manindan is a low-grade elixir of the 'Forty Dan', a product of the Murim tournament.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The efficacy of the elixir itself is reduced, but if he eats it as it is, Jung Eunho will literally go crazy and become a demon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order to neutralize the demon corps, at least a mild elixir equivalent to the demon dan's performance was needed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sister..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Eunho, who came to his senses, struggled to open his eyelids. Jung Heewon held his brother's hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Eunho-ssi, it’s okay."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Dad…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's okay, breathe. Don't think about anything else."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reaching out her hand and covering her brother's eyelids, Jung Heewon looked back at me. Now I really don't have much time left. If it's delayed here, Jung Eunho won't be able to heal even with the magic medicine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I got up from my seat and went up to the rain stage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was still a way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had coins left over, and if I had to, I could have bought the elixir even with a higher amount by opening the 'Exchange' instead of 'Dokkaebi bag'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If fewer constellations were watching me, I would have thought of that method.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Shi Huangdi, who dreamed of immortality' proposes a contract with you, he can give you a simple elixir.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'A Loan Shark Aiming For The Heart' says that you can exchange 100,000 coins for a summons' class elixir.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Damn kids.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I use the 'exchange' now, I will be able to buy elixirs at ridiculous prices.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Maritime Admiral' argues that he is such a ridiculous profiteer.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Merchant of the Daedong River' holds his tongue saying that there are people worse than him.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, the worst was not assumed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I climbed onto the stage and looked at the dragon head ark and the meteorite guarded by the envoys.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Green.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As mentioned in the ORV, meteorites have different contents depending on their color.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'yellow meteorite' contains a guide to prepare for disasters, the 'bright red meteorite' contains weapons, and the 'black red meteorite' contains material resources.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, this meteorite from another world had a faint bluish-green color.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I remember, the green meteorites contain return items related to the 'scenario'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I once again reviewed the contents of 'Omniscient Reader' and ordered the 'Thoughts' to change into 'Broken Faith'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Thoughts of almost everything' defies your command.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it's because it was overworked today?</p>
<p class="orv_line">This guy didn't listen.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can't use Incite for 10 minutes as a penalty.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Due to the penalty, [Incite] is also unusable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I picked up an abandoned baton on the floor and blew into it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Can I break a meteorite with this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I honestly had no confidence. It was because my limbs were in a state of not listening to the reaction of [Incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Can I break it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned my head, Jung Heewon who had approached me was standing next to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will do it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before I could nod my head, Jung Heewon picked up the 'Mikazuki Munezika' that had fallen on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Soon after, an unusual magical energy began to run through Jung Heewon's body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A deep madness overflows from Jung Heewon.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A strange heat radiated from her calm expression. Eyes that give you goosebumps just by looking at them. Without any hesitation, her blade cut down the meteorite vertically.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kagagak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though it was a meteorite of considerable size, her swordsmanship neatly cut the meteorite in two.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking closely, a black and faint aura flowed through her whole body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new characteristic of the character Jung Heewon is wriggling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">She has already awakened as the 'Judge of the Ten Demons'. However, another characteristic evolution was taking place inside her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was clear what she would become as a result of this evolution.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'The Mad Butcher.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, Sergeant Jung Moonho's death left a deep scar in Jung Heewon's heart. That was a bad sign.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「While Yoo Jonghyuk’s return was repeated, 'Mad Butcher' never made a friend. She was always alone, and in the end she died alone. No one in the world tried to understand her madness, and no one understood her either.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I don't want Jung Heewon to be like that. To do that, I must save Jung Eunho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Passsss.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the spot where the meteorites had scattered, a black wooden box was raised.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A wooden box made of much better material than the one received as a scenario reward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as I opened the lid, a brilliant golden light flowed out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Inside the meteorite, there were three eggs of 'Summoning Team'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is relieved by your luck.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Emperor Shi Huang, Who Dreamed of Immortality' is protesting to the Administration, saying that something is wrong!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Shaolin's Arcane Elixir, Summoning Team.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you think about it, the luck that came from the &lt;3rd Murim&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since it was a meteorite, there was nothing strange about this amount of compensation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. I think this will work."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Together with Jung Heewon, I immediately helped Jung Eunho and made him sit up on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It might be uncomfortable, but bear with it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Eunho's condition was more serious than expected. All the skin and organs through which the bullet fragments penetrated were poisoned, and some tissues had already suffered severe necrosis.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was amazing that this little child had suppressed the pain until now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the application of Kim Dokja's mixing of 'Forty Dan' and 'Daehwandan' in 'Omniscient Reader'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some of the medicinal ingredients are mixed to neutralize the toxicity.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With the dim light, Jung Eunho's complexion began to quickly return.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how severe the wounds are, it is eventually a physical wound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the basic story wasn't damaged, there was a possibility that he could fully recover with the power of the elixir.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did it last like 5 minutes?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Eunho's body suddenly began to convulse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hurriedly checked Jung Eunho's veins.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'The First Sword of Goryeo' is silently gazing at the incarnation 'Jeong Eunho'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Belatedly, I thought I wanted to go to sleep.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Maritime Admiral' says that the boy is not yet ready to accept the elixir.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a symptom commonly referred to as schizophrenia.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「In the case of the intoxication caused by the side effects of the elixir, there are two solutions. One is that, according to heavenly luck, the person involved in the orgasm will attain enlightenment. The second one is to deal with the runaway magic.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A phrase from the 'Ways of Survival' that came to mind naturally.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-ssi. It seems that I and Heewon-ssi will have to help."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I briefly explained the situation to Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, the solution introduced in 'Ways of Survival' was possible only for the masters of Murim.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But as of now, there was no other master.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We held each other's hands tightly, and each held onto Jung Eunho's hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Deed deed deed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as an ocean current flows into a river through tributaries, Jung Eunho's magic power rushed wildly through my fingers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It felt like the clogged blood vessels had been released, and all the mana in the body that had not been used was boiling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I instinctively sensed it. If we can overcome this difficulty, I, Jung Heewon, and maybe Jung Eunho will be much stronger than before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is, if we don't get through this, all three of us will die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I endured the pain that pushed through my teeth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Koo-goo-goo-goo!</p>
<p class="orv_line">We didn't say anything to each other, but we didn't let go of our hands until the end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The complexion of Jung Heewon, whose magical power level was low, was getting tired.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I too was a little nervous. Jung Eunho's mana, which I thought would calm down quickly, was tireless.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cold sweat broke out all over my body, and my vision darkened as if mold had grown in my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A reality I  did not want to admit raised its head.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Jung Eunho cannot be saved.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was brief, but a dazzling temptation arose. If we let go even now, we will suffer serious internal injuries, but we may be able to save Jung Heewon. However, Jung Eunho and I will die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was absurd when it came to this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is as if some great destiny is at work.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「It seemed that someone was somehow trying to turn Jung Heewon into the Mad Butcher.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As if she had read my thoughts, Jung Heewon held my hand tightly with her demon-like eyes shining.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I regretted it belatedly. If only I had learned at least a basic healing skill...</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon's body was leaning as blood poured from her nose and mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I became desperate and tried to extend my hand to save Jung Heewon.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your new story will emerge!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Seolhwa, 'the tenacious Murim master' begins the story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Just as a real Murim master uses his own magic, Jung Eunho's magic was put on hold. The skill of controlling the flow of magical power with a strong spirit. Following the story told by the tale, magic began to flow through the energy and blood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly figured out whose story this was.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「It was the story given by the ark.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A story of the essence of martial arts experienced by the Ark, from being a human to becoming a constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The flow of mana, which had been racing like a runaway engine, gradually calmed down, and the complexions of Jung Heewon and Jung Eunho gradually became more comfortable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the flow of magical power subsided, Jung Eunho's agony could be heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sister. Sorry."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon replied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you okay."</p>
<p class="orv_line">What is sorry and what is okay? I don't know, but the two of them crossed a boundary with it. He lost his father and accepted the fact that he had to live in this world.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「And writer Lee Hakhyun recorded all these stories.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly became curious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">These sentences that I often think of, where the hell do they come from?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Could it be the 'Ways of Survival'? Is it 'Omniscient Reader'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Could it be the 'Fourth Wall'? Will it be the 'Last Wall'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If not that.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Do you want to know?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I would like to know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though I thought I shouldn't lose consciousness, little by little my eyes darkened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I fell into a deep drowsiness, and after a while I heard the sound of someone waking me up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And when I opened my eyes again.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「You're here again.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I was lying on the white snowfield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw a person wearing a pure white coat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I called his name.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Kim Dokja.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As if he knew what had happened, he looked down at me with a somewhat forlorn look.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Drink.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He held out the teacup he was holding. Warm steam was rising from the teacup.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「It was prepared by Yoo Jonghyuk from the 81st round.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk of the 81st turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I remember, Yoo Jonghyuk is good at cooking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I got up and took the teacup. I drank a sip.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's good.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My stomach warmed up, my anxious heart subsided little by little, and peace came to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He can make something like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I guess so. Because Kim Dokja is 'The Oldest Dream'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is the god of this world, and whatever he imagines becomes reality, so the hand holding the cup trembled lightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja looked at me without saying a word.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Clearly everything was peaceful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, in this peaceful world between the lines, I felt a slightly different feeling than usual.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The water in the teacup shook.</p>
<p class="orv_line">People could be seen above the shaking tea water. Someone screamed, someone howled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Among them was Jung Heewon's face, and Jung Moonho's face. There was the face of Jung Jaewoo, and there was also the face of the Ark.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked Kim Dokja, holding the teacup with both hands, fearing that they would spill over.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Why on earth are you… still having dreams like this?」</p></div>
