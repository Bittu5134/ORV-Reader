<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Jonghyuk. Maybe the regression turns you and I built up were just like a storm in a teacup. Our years of struggling for dozens of rounds couldn't change a single sliver of the night sky."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Then, Yoo Jonghyuk looked down at the stars in the night sky reflected on the teacup with silent eyes.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"One day, the moment will come when all the stars in the sky will fall and I will be left alone in this world. Even then, if I'm holding this cup."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk emptied all the remaining tea as if swallowing the night sky reflected in the tea water.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"At that time, the world would have changed."」</p>
<br>

<p class="orv_line">—Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">This was the second time I had seen someone die right in front of my eyes.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Whoever reads this story dies.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The brilliance in his eyes dimmed, and his body temperature cooled. It becomes an eye that can no longer read anything.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Spirit of Elaine Forest, Holy Oil, Summoning team or whatever.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">There’s no use. It's too late.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was a wound that could not be revived even if I had an elixir.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I know.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, I couldn't stand it if I didn't even think about it. If I don't think like that, I will think of something else.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I blankly looked down at my hands. Just before, when I wrote a sentence, my hand was stained red.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Dad."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon said. Jung Heewon spoke in a low voice while holding Sergeant Jung Moonho's hand, which was cold.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Wake up. This isn't it."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If you say that, it's as if he'd really wake up again.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">However, Sergeant Jung Moonho could not open his eyes again.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The story with a 90% success rate of reproduction was reproduced that way.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Sergeant Jung Moonho is dead. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">All I could do was record this moment.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Jung Heewon was crying. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The body of Sergeant Jung Moonho, who had passed away, melted into the demonic energy of the defect explosion and was completely crushed.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to ask.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Why did you risk your life for this child?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe I know the answer to why you jumped in for a character you have no connection with.</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I witnessed a similar phenomenon when Jung Jaewoo died in the theater dungeon.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Even then, the pitch-black space split, and the white hand snatched Jung Jaewoo's soul.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">However.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">What appeared this time was a black hand.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The black hand that jumped out in an instant seized the soul of the kkoma Kim Dokja as it is, leaving the space.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It disappeared through the cracks of the space.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A white hand last time.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A black hand this time.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't understand. What kind of beings take away the souls of dead readers?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Is this the RepresentativeKimDokja I saw at the banquet then? Or is it the Outer God that appeared this time?</p>

<p class="orv_line">This kind of story that no one would want, why the hell did it have to continue? My vision flickered as if it was dark, and the swirling emotions were sucking me in like sand.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk of 'Ways of Survival' was talking. Listening to Yoo Jonghyuk’s voice, which I don't even know how many times I heard, I managed to get rid of my stomach-churning feeling.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The reward of the 'Bounty Scenario' that came with a huge coin sponsorship.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately opened the wooden box that came down from the air.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The elixir contained in the wooden box was something I was familiar with.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">'Manindan.'</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Will this elixir work even if I give it to him?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately called Bihyung via Dokkaebi communication.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">'Is the reward worth it? Honestly, it wasn't a scenario that would end with such a reward.'</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was not a different existence, it was a scenario completed by defeating an Outer God. However, it doesn't make sense to say that the only reward is a 'manindan'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, the answer came right away.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—It's already being discussed at the management bureau. I also put a word in it. I guess it will take some time.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It seems that Bihyung is also having a lot of trouble with this 'Outer God' situation.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Heck, since the Outer World appeared before the fifth scenario even started, there must have been an uproar in the management office by now.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who saw the manindan, asked.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Is that a cure?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"This alone is not enough."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Manindan is a low-grade elixir of the 'Forty Dan', a product of the Murim tournament.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The efficacy of the elixir itself is reduced, but if he eats it as it is, Jung Eunho will literally go crazy and become a demon.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In order to neutralize the demon corps, at least a mild elixir equivalent to the demon dan's performance was needed.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Sister..."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Eunho, who came to his senses, struggled to open his eyelids. Jung Heewon held his brother's hand.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Eunho-ssi, it’s okay."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Dad…"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's okay, breathe. Don't think about anything else."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Reaching out her hand and covering her brother's eyelids, Jung Heewon looked back at me. Now I really don't have much time left. If it's delayed here, Jung Eunho won't be able to heal even with the magic medicine.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I got up from my seat and went up to the rain stage.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">There was still a way.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I had coins left over, and if I had to, I could have bought the elixir even with a higher amount by opening the 'Exchange' instead of 'Dokkaebi bag'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If fewer constellations were watching me, I would have thought of that method.</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I climbed onto the stage and looked at the dragon head ark and the meteorite guarded by the envoys.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">However, this meteorite from another world had a faint bluish-green color.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As I remember, the green meteorites contain return items related to the 'scenario'.</p>
<br>
<hr>

<p class="orv_line">Due to the penalty, [Incite] is also unusable.</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I picked up an abandoned baton on the floor and blew into it.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Can I break a meteorite with this?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I honestly had no confidence. It was because my limbs were in a state of not listening to the reaction of [Incite].</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Can I break it?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned my head, Jung Heewon who had approached me was standing next to me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I will do it."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Before I could nod my head, Jung Heewon picked up the 'Mikazuki Munezika' that had fallen on the floor.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Soon after, an unusual magical energy began to run through Jung Heewon's body.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A deep madness overflows from Jung Heewon.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A strange heat radiated from her calm expression. Eyes that give you goosebumps just by looking at them. Without any hesitation, her blade cut down the meteorite vertically.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kagagak.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Even though it was a meteorite of considerable size, her swordsmanship neatly cut the meteorite in two.</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">'The Mad Butcher.'</p>
<br>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I don't want Jung Heewon to be like that. To do that, I must save Jung Eunho.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Passsss.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">At the spot where the meteorites had scattered, a black wooden box was raised.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A wooden box made of much better material than the one received as a scenario reward.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as I opened the lid, a brilliant golden light flowed out.</p>

<p class="orv_line">"Yes. I think this will work."</p>

<p class="orv_line">Together with Jung Heewon, I immediately helped Jung Eunho and made him sit up on the floor.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It might be uncomfortable, but bear with it."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Eunho's condition was more serious than expected. All the skin and organs through which the bullet fragments penetrated were poisoned, and some tissues had already suffered severe necrosis.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was amazing that this little child had suppressed the pain until now.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was the application of Kim Dokja's mixing of 'Forty Dan' and 'Daehwandan' in 'Omniscient Reader'.</p>

<p class="orv_line">A phrase from the 'Ways of Survival' that came to mind naturally.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-ssi. It seems that I and Heewon-ssi will have to help."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I briefly explained the situation to Jung Heewon.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, the solution introduced in 'Ways of Survival' was possible only for the masters of Murim.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">But as of now, there was no other master.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">We held each other's hands tightly, and each held onto Jung Eunho's hands.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">And.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Deed deed deed.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Just as an ocean current flows into a river through tributaries, Jung Eunho's magic power rushed wildly through my fingers.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It felt like the clogged blood vessels had been released, and all the mana in the body that had not been used was boiling.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I instinctively sensed it. If we can overcome this difficulty, I, Jung Heewon, and maybe Jung Eunho will be much stronger than before.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is, if we don't get through this, all three of us will die.</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Koo-goo-goo-goo!</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">We didn't say anything to each other, but we didn't let go of our hands until the end.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The complexion of Jung Heewon, whose magical power level was low, was getting tired.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I too was a little nervous. Jung Eunho's mana, which I thought would calm down quickly, was tireless.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Cold sweat broke out all over my body, and my vision darkened as if mold had grown in my eyes.</p>

<p class="orv_line">It was brief, but a dazzling temptation arose. If we let go even now, we will suffer serious internal injuries, but we may be able to save Jung Heewon. However, Jung Eunho and I will die.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was absurd when it came to this.</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I regretted it belatedly. If only I had learned at least a basic healing skill...</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon's body was leaning as blood poured from her nose and mouth.</p>
