<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye signaled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Fire!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye's ship began to fire.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Poseidon frowned as he was hit by the concentrated fire. He swung Triana with all his might, as if he could not accept the fact that he was tied down by a mere human's fire.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Get out.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The blue created by the light of the snow swept across the surface and hit the ghost fleet directly. The ships could not withstand Poseidon's attack and sank.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Skill, reactivate 'Ghost Fleet Lv.???'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, the ships were revived by Lee Jihye's simple signal. The fleet, which was in perfect condition with not a single bit of damage, began to fire again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Load! Fire!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was the reason why she could reign as an invincible monarch in the ocean. As long as there was an ocean, her fleet could never be destroyed. Poseidon growled as if he didn’t understand, kicking away the barrage.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The sea is mine! If you don’t clean up that trash right now—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"You’re talking just like the old man."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[What?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Why is the sea yours? Did you buy it with money?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who would dare to make such a fuss in front of a mythical constellation?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Poseidon, who had frozen for a moment, answered in a distorted voice.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The gods of our <Olympus> created the sea. And I am the great—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"That’s nonsense. The sea existed before you were even created. Didn't you learn about primordial soup in school?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, Lee Jihye doesn’t know much about how the sea was created either. She wasn't listening in science class.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, while they were killing time with pointless conversation, there were two people running through the hazy sea of ​​space.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 41st master. And—</p>
<p class="orv_line">'The 41st ahjussi.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye knows that he is not the Kim Dokja she remembers. But now, that didn't matter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter what world Kim Dokja was in, Kim Dokja was Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye accepted that fact.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Ahjussi chose this world.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">She didn't know why. However, Kim Dokja judged that there was an ending that could only be reached by reading this world completely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye respected that judgment and decided to reserve her judgment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She didn't know whether Kim Dokja would return to them or not. This world might be a comedy or a tragedy. However, just as Kim Dokja once protected her, she would protect Kim Dokja's choice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And at the end of this world, she would grab Kim Dokja's neck, who was laughing stupidly, and say, "I knew this would happen."</p>
<p class="orv_line">'For that to be possible.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">First, she had to take down Poseidon in front of her.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The mythical constellation, Poseidon.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A great star that she wouldn't have dared look at in the past. Even the king of the underworld, 'Father of the Rich Night,' had a hard time with it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'But if it were me now.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">The tension between the two beings across the sea began to rise endlessly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Lee Jihye's momentum grew fiercer, Poseidon's expression hardened even more.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Mr. Sea. I'm going to give it my all from now on. Can you handle it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it's a mythical grade constellation, it's burdensome to explode above a certain level.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is a universe without a 'scenario'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If one made a mistake, one could draw the attention of the gods of the other world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, the fight here was a matter of life and death even for a mythical grade constellation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Young human, who do you think I am?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sea grew angry. As the storm raged, waves swirled around and began to distort all the ships.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A strong gale that even the constellations wandering nearby were swept away.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Get out of here!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Artemis and Apollo retreated in fear. It was a disaster that even a mythical-grade constellation would not be able to survive if it was swept away. Only Lee Jihye ran through the storm of disaster. Her [Ghost Walk], which had been developed to its limit, assisted her steps, and her [Kendo], which had reached the realm of transcendence, paved the way. [god killing]’s eyes flashed in the foam covering her head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Poseidon’s new form was visible in the distance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the shadow that seemed close enough to touch but not quite there, Lee Jihye thought of the old Kim Dokja’s face.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Jihye-ya."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">She always felt like an outsider in this story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was not as strong as Yoo Jonghyuk, as smart as Han Sooyoung, or as affectionate as Yoo Sangah.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Well, so what?"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">She was also not as honest as Jung Heewon, as firm as Lee Hyunsung, or as desperate as Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even after seeing the end of the world, breaking through the [Fourth Wall], crossing world lines, and finally losing Kim Dokja— she was still an outsider in the story.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"You worked hard. I know."」</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Sunsal reached the limit and cut through the waves. The waves that jumped up left cuts on her cheeks and arms like blades, but she didn't stop.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">She cut and cut again. How many times did she cut?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahhhhh!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A blind wave cut through her side. Bright red blood spurted out and she was swept away by the current. The storm of a mythical constellation was ravaging her entire body. She could see the sea creatures that smelled blood coming towards her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She didn't put down her sword even as she was being pushed here and there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I really liked your story."</p>
<p class="orv_line">That day, the 'Lee Jihye' that Kim Dokja had talked about was not her. So she tried. She swung her sword again and again to become the Lee Jihye that Kim Dok-ja had talked about. In order to reach the sentence that Kim Dokja had read, in the end, she hoped that that damned ahjussi would read her alive here someday.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A phrase that was barely obtained after training and training again.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「True God Ouijeolgi.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There is no such technique in Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the master or the great master Breaking the Sky Swordsman had seen it, it would have been greatly criticized, a technique that does not even appear in the 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Breaking the Sky Myeol Hwanggeom.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The swordsmanship that was only possible through Lee Jihye’s swordplay shone.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「A tragic attack to destroy the king of a world.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">She doesn’t know if Kim Dokja is seeing this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But if he was, she really wanted to tell him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kwaaaaaaaaaa—</p>
<p class="orv_line">The exploding sea screamed, and Poseidon’s incarnation body leaped out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Poseidon, whose side was deeply torn, let out a loud scream, Lee Jihye’s sword cut Poseidon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Through the flying water droplets, the scenery of the 'Recycling Center' could be seen in the distance. Looking at the school scene that was being torn apart by the storm, Lee Jihye, who had spat out a lump of blood, laughed bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'You must come to the next graduation ceremony.'</p>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The story was pouring out of Kim Dokja's heart.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Sentences that appeared in real time above the newspaper.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Yoo Jonghyuk ran while blocking the story from flowing out.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If this continues, the youngest will die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation scolded the kkoma Kim Dokjas around him to calm his troubled mind.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Hey, don't you have any other solutions?"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The kkoma Kim Dokjas looked at the Demon King of Salvation all at once. It seemed as if they were asking himwhy he was asking that.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Wasn't that person the biggest Kim Dokja?"」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"He's a pitiful hyung."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When the Demon King of Salvation suddenly opened his mouth in shock after being bombarded, the kkoma Kim Dokja with his hair tied in a ponytail spoke.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"You said you were the first Kim Dokja."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As the Demon King of Salvation nodded, Ponytail Kim Dokja asked again.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Then there's a 'second' too, right?"」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"That's it."」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"I don't know what the circumstances are, but right now doesn't seem like the time to be weighing the pros and cons."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation twitched his lips and let out a light sigh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The kkoma Kim Dokja was right. The most important thing right now was the survival of the youngest. For that, the 'Demon King of Salvation' would do anything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He slowly took a deep breath and opened his mouth in a loud voice.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Second. Can you hear me?"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Second Kim Dokja' is not here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But even if he's not here, he'll be listening.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"I know you're upset about my decision. You probably wanted to stay with <Kim Dokja Company>."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If he can't hear, [The Fourth Wall] will tell him instead. That guy has this skill too.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"It's all my fault. I'll admit it. So just this once—"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With his eyes tightly shut, the Demon King of Salvation thought about the 'Second Kim Dokja'.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Just this once, can't you help the youngest?"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He is Kim Dokja who understands the deepest sadness of anyone in this world.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"If this continues, another sad story like you will be born."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And after a while, sentences began to appear on the newspaper again.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk ran with me through the darkness. The universe was pitch black, and I couldn't see anything. We ran through that universe together. To be exact, Yoo Junghyuk ran alone, with me by his side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I squeezed out the voice that was barely coming out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Jonghyuk."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't say anything. The stories are leaking."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk took the angel out of his arms and bandaged my wounds. He used the secret of martial arts, Cheonjangsa, on me. Honestly, I was touched.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You are a good guy after all. My eyes were not wrong."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if asking what nonsense I was talking about again, Yoo Jonghyuk glared at me with sharp eyes then put his arm around me. Occasionally, an explosion could be heard from afar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What happened to Lee Jihye?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it were Lee Jihye, would she be able to defeat Poseidon?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if Poseidon was defeated, it wouldn’t be the end. <Olympus> had many powerful gods. Zeus, who was in the upper row, was there, and there were the other 12 gods.</p>
<p class="orv_line"><Olympus> wasn’t all that there was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And there weren’t just one of them chasing us now.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the nebula <Vedas> are looking for you!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the nebula <Asgard> are looking for you!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the nebula <Gwiok> are looking for you!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story of the 'Demon King of Salvation' had exhausted its power, and I was no longer a constellation or a constellation’s agent. I was just an incarnation with a few plausible stories. Now, all I could do with my weak incarnation body that couldn’t even make a sound was to use an item to convey my intentions.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have applied for the 'Midday Tryst'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk frowned for a moment and nodded hesitantly.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Midday Tryst' connected.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, you’ll accept anyway, so don’t be annoyed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Just leave me alone and go.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel the presence of constellations chasing us from afar. Even Yoo Jonghyuk couldn’t possibly deal with them all. It would be impossible even if he used all of the story imprints.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I know you received a personal scenario. But even if that fails, there’s no particular penalty, right?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk’s personal scenario was established by Uriel’s authority.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no way Uriel would suggest a scenario with such an excessive penalty to Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I’m going to die soon anyway.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, I really didn’t intend to die. There is a way to survive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There must be.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it would be difficult if Yoo Jonghyuk is by my side. If Yoo Jonghyuk is here, Yoo Jonghyuk will also be in danger.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Why are you trying to save me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">That’s why I made up my mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Aren’t I a nuisance to you anyway? You’ve disliked me from the beginning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter what happens, let’s get this guy away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I’m not the Cheon Inho you were looking for. I’m not the one who deceived the stars, nor am I a great villain who can subdue the Ten Evils. I…</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">—What do you know? Of all the Yoo Jonghyuks I know, you know the least. I…</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You’re not Cheon Inho. I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk cut me off and looked at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You’re Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don’t know if that’s your real name or not, but I’ll call you that for now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The way Yoo Jonghyuk called that name in the 41st round felt strange. I said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Yes. Please do. And that Kim Dokja, just put him down and run away. That’s what you have to do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"My job is to save you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">—No, why?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of crows could be heard nearby. It seemed that Odin’s 'night crows' had come nearby.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now there really was no time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Yoo Jonghyuk continued speaking in a calm voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You saved both the mainstream and weak groups of people at Geumho Station."</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Yes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It was stupid. In the end, turning people who would otherwise be divided into one group is meaningless and pointless."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to refute him right away, but Yoo Jonghyuk continued speaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You did strange things at Chungmuro ​​Group, too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I recalled what had happened at Chungmuro ​​Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You blocked the 'emergency defense' that I had set off. It was worthless. All the people at Chungmuro ​​Station are destined to become subordinates of the Ten Evils."</p>
<p class="orv_line">—No, wait. What on earth are you trying to say…</p>
<p class="orv_line">"When we elected the station representative, I clearly gave you the flag. But you dared to refuse to be the 'representative'. Because of that, everything went awry."</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That’s…</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even at the Washington Dome, you did something you shouldn’t have done."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk continued to talk as if he didn’t want to hear my answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The point was that I only did things I shouldn’t have done.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"All those things ultimately led to your death."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is that what he wanted to say?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded with a bitter smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Yes. That’s right. It was a poor choice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Yoo Jonghyuk didn’t finish talking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why did you save me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Yes?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I tried to kill you several times. At Geumho Station, at Chungmuro ​​Station, and in the theater dungeon. But why did you—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, I saved Yoo Jonghyuk quite a few times in this round. In the theater dungeon, in the Washington Dome.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It just so happened that way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You always saved someone, didn’t you? Isn’t the opposite also possible sometimes?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk licked his lips several times and then opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You won’t be able to reach the end of the scenario with such a naive story."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn’t figure out what this regressor was trying to say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is he trying to criticize me since I’m about to die?</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, I saw my story flowing out through the tightly tied ceiling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk looked down at the story without saying anything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was only then that I realized what this damned regressor was trying to say.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「How does Yoo Jonghyuk know everything that happened to me?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I thought maybe no one would read it. No one would remember how I lived and what stories I had built up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"And yet that pathetic story—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was someone who had read the whole story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It was the first time I’d seen it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was the main character of this world.</p>
