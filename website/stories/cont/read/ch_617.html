<p class="orv_line">Exactly three days have passed since the incident in the Theater Dungeon. During those three days, the name that hit Chungmuro Station was as follows.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Kim Dokja!&quot;」</div>「"Kim Dokja!"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although some people just tilted their heads upon hearing his name. Some could not contain their joy.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Really? Is there really Kim Dokja here?&quot;」</div>「"Really? Is there really Kim Dokja here?"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;I lived. We&#x27;re alive now.&quot;」</div>「"I lived. We're alive now."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, not everyone who remembered his name was happy.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Is he really Dokja Kim? Doesn&#x27;t it just become more dangerous if we get entangled?&quot;」</div>「"Is he really Dokja Kim? Doesn't it just become more dangerous if we get entangled?"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Would anything change if Kim Dokja appeared now? To be honest, we all know what Kim Dokja knows.&quot;」</div>「"Would anything change if Kim Dokja appeared now? To be honest, we all know what Kim Dokja knows."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some people doubted the reality of the rumors, while others dismissed them as not a big deal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, whoever stood on either side, those who remembered &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27; would have thought of him and looked up at the sky for a moment.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「And with that, Lee Hakhyun thought it was enough.」</div>「And with that, Lee Hakhyun thought it was enough.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The roof of the theater dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After sighing lightly, I looked up at the sky, and the sun was setting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Until all the scenarios were over, how many times did Kim Dokja look up at the sky?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Demon-like Judge of Fire&#x27; is looking at you.]</div>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking at you.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Abyssal Black Flame Dragon&#x27; is looking at you]</div>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is looking at you]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Prisoner of the Golden Headband is looking at you.]</div>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband is looking at you.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Watching the stars in the sky decrease, what did Kim Dokja think until the end?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I looked back, Kyung Sein and Lee Dansu were waiting for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is the dungeon cleanup over?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. It seems there are no people left now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Right after the theater dungeon ended, we cleaned up the acquired items and transported the injured readers to the bottom of the theater.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There are no posters left, and the dungeon errors seem to be almost normalized.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were some people who couldn&#x27;t get out of the movie even after the dungeon was cleared, perhaps because of the probability aftermath that occurred on the roof of the theater.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, some readers, including Kyung Sein and Lee Dansu, actively cooperated with me, and after a few days of desperate struggle, we succeeded in rescuing all those trapped in the dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How is the status of the 2 apostles?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Fortunately, Killer King fell asleep after eating the &#x27;Elaine Forest Spirit&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King who I was worried about is also in good shape. I sighed lightly as I recalled Killer King fighting against the &#x27;Lord of the Cretaceous Period&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you okay, Inho-ssi? There are more than 10 pills of Elaine’s Spirit of the Forest that you used this time...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Elaine Forest Spirit&#x27; is an item that costs 500 coins each. It wasn&#x27;t a small expenditure for me either, but it was well worth the money I spent saving readers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, this kind of expense comes back with sponsorship.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you okay? Aren&#x27;t you two hurt?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As you can see, I’m safe.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein gave strength to her small biceps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu-ahjussi asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is your friend okay?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey, what… I haven’t done anything in particular.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Officially, I was known to have passed out and woke up in a corner of the rooftop garden.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, it was officially said that it was, and unofficially, it was as follows.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I became Kim Dokja for a while.」</div>「I became Kim Dokja for a while.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know why I did that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But at that moment, I couldn&#x27;t help but do it. Maybe not me, but anyone else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were people thrown into the perishing world, and there was a person they had been waiting for.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And only I knew the secrets of this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had no choice but to lie.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because I don&#x27;t want them to give up on life. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s for anyone, because I want them to continue to endure this cadaveric scenario with me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I needed readers, and I wanted them to live on. That&#x27;s all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you find anything on the roof? I heard that the battle was here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Currently, it is known that there was a confrontation between Kim Dokja, Yoo Jonghyuk, Jung Heewon, and the owner of the theater in the &#x27;theater dungeon&#x27; around Chungmuro Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yeah, well... nothing special.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was fortunate for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was because my head hurt to explain the things I met and fought with Han Sooyoung here one by one.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Demon-like Judge of Fire&#x27; asks what the hell happened.]</div>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' asks what the hell happened.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">It seemed that the constellations were unable to properly grasp the situation, perhaps due to the influence of the &#x27;probability aftermath&#x27; that blew on the rooftop at the time. To say that no one had really seen that great battle, I felt a bit regretful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a clash with &#x27;Han Sooyoung&#x27;, not another person.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation that has not yet revealed their modifier smiles lightly.]</div>[A constellation that has not yet revealed their modifier smiles lightly.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">You never know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Has anyone seen this guy?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Really… Was Kim Dokja here? Did you see him, Inho-ssi?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I inadvertently looked back at the place where I fought with Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thinking back, it was a dizzying battle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was defeated by her sword, and pierced through the heart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I definitely remember dying there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I woke up again, I was lying on the roof with my wounds healed. The wound was also fully recovered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps Han Sooyoung brought me back to life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did she treat me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">And where did she go?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel the eyes of two people looking at me behind my back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice for these people to be sluggish?</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, there was no Kim Dokja here. Being here was just that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, I saw him too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked back at the two of them with a grin.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Obviously there was Kim Dokja.」</div>「Obviously there was Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Honesty isn&#x27;t always a good thing. We often have to let go of life with lies. Maybe that&#x27;s why you read the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I felt like I knew a little bit why Han Sooyoung brought me back to life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Come down.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I walked with my hands on the shoulders of the two of them. I looked back to where I had been standing for the last time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I really wish it was you who were there.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Two blue eyes appeared from the pitch-black darkness of space.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【They are here.】</div>【They are here.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">Starting with him, other eyes appeared all over the universe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Red or blue, eyes engraved with a story of their own. A majesty that swung from beyond the void permeated every aspect of its eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The pupils were all looking at one world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The world line they watched for a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is the forgotten 41st world, and the last &#x27;blank space&#x27; allowed to be modified by the &#x27;last wall&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Those who saw the oldest dream.】</div>【Those who saw the oldest dream.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">An electric sound was heard from the other side of the universe. The light of thought resounding in a place where there is no medium.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The nameless ones howled in pain, and the enraged deities of the other world roared with hateful rage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The outer gods representing all the abandoned things in the world were talking.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Kim Dokja Company.】</div>【Kim Dokja Company.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">The universe vibrated ominously. Foreigners&#x27; eyes turned to Earth. The far-off legend in his gaze engulfed the entire galaxy andlS wriggled.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Calm down. It is not yet time for you to move.】</div>【Calm down. It is not yet time for you to move.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone interrupted them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A being wearing a white coat was handling the burden of outer gods on behalf of Earth.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Are you going to ruin the final chapter?】</div>【Are you going to ruin the final chapter?】</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was RepresentativeKimDokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The outer god who confirmed his appearance uttered a truth all at once.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【You promised.】</div>【You promised.】</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Kim Dokja’s Company should not exist here.】</div>【Kim Dokja’s Company should not exist here.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, RepresentativeKimDokja shook his head.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【I am the one who called &#x27;Kim Dokja’s Company&#x27; here.】</div>【I am the one who called 'Kim Dokja’s Company' here.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if he couldn&#x27;t understand the words, the intensity of the story bent once again in the space.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in the midst of suffocating sparks, RepresentativeKimDokja continued with a calm expression.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【This story can only be completed without them, did you forget? As long as they exist, the universe you want will never arrive.】</div>【This story can only be completed without them, did you forget? As long as they exist, the universe you want will never arrive.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">For the first time, the momentum of the outer god slowed down at his remarks.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【They will all die here. With the &#x27;oldest dream&#x27; they loved.&#x27;】</div>【They will all die here. With the 'oldest dream' they loved.'】</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja, with a sweet smile, continued talking while appeasing the outer god.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【So please wait a bit. The final chapter will be prepared for you soon.】</div>【So please wait a bit. The final chapter will be prepared for you soon.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">The eyes of the outer gods trembled lightly, and one by one they closed their heavy eyelids.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The turbulence of the stories, in which the gazes that oppressed the earth were shaken, calmed down little by little.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the eyes closed for the last time, a voice as deep as the deep sea resounded.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【The unrecorded story will watch over you.】</div>【The unrecorded story will watch over you.】</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as I went down to Chungmuro Station, a message appeared in front of my eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Main Scenario #3 - Emergency defense battle has ended.]</div>[Main Scenario #3 - Emergency defense battle has ended.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You got 2,000 coins as a reward.]</div>[You got 2,000 coins as a reward.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I forgot about the &#x27;emergency defense battle&#x27;. The third scenario that was about to end early due to the &#x27;venomous fog&#x27; that was sprayed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have made a decisive contribution to the &#x27;emergency defense battle&#x27;.]</div>[You have made a decisive contribution to the 'emergency defense battle'.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You got an additional 2,000 coins as a reward.]</div>[You got an additional 2,000 coins as a reward.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your first story related to this scenario is germinating.]</div>[Your first story related to this scenario is germinating.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">First story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw the message last time, but I was nervous.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because it was very important what one could gain from a birth story in this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja&#x27;s first tale was &#x27;The King of a Kingless World&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What is my first story?</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I checked the message log, there were a lot of unread  messages piled up.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The progress of the main scenario is being delayed due to the aftermath of probability.]</div>[The progress of the main scenario is being delayed due to the aftermath of probability.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The fourth main scenario will be announced in an hour.]</div>[The fourth main scenario will be announced in an hour.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently, there are 48 unread  messages.]</div>[Currently, there are 48 unread  messages.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">From scenario delay messages to indirect messages from various constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, it seems that the aftermath of the probability that blew into the rooftop garden was great.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s to the extent that the progress of the &#x27;main scenario&#x27; is delayed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this was the case, the Management Bureau would have been talking about it, but no, it wasn&#x27;t just the Management Bureau.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The nebula &lt;Tamra&gt; is paying attention to you.]</div>[The nebula <Tamra> is paying attention to you.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I laughed bitterly inwardly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know if I should like this kind of message or be anxious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow, Inho-ssi. Now...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein was surprised and started talking. Apparently, the message was completely public.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As expected, Inho-ssi went to the last floor, so it must be different. Me and ahjussi couldn’t go that far…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">She said, &quot;What floor did he say you went to?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The 7th floor.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, the 7th floor was also a great result. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s almost as if it&#x27;s been uploaded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wait for a sec. By the way, what if it&#x27;s on the 7th floor?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did yo go into &#x27;that movie&#x27; by any chance?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who knew what the movie was about, nodded as if she had been waiting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yeah! Inho-ssi should have seen it too!&quot; Being summoned! Load! Launch! Ku Kwa Kwa Kwah! Two-quake-quake-quawa!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">How can you describe the legendary Battle of Myeongnyang in that way?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Aside from Kyung Sein’s vocabulary, honestly, I was a little envious seeing her in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It must not have been easy to convince Lee Jihye.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah, that&#x27;s right. Ahjussi and I worked hard to encourage her. You know what Kim Dokja  did.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You did that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">From what I remember, I don&#x27;t think Kim Dokja did &#x27;encourage&#x27; Lee Jihye. Rather, didn&#x27;t he awaken her in a very dangerous way?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps conscious of my gaze, Kyung Sein smiled and looked back at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hee hee, I didn&#x27;t do it exactly, but you... My words didn&#x27;t work.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was as if I had a vague idea of what had happened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu-Ahjussi might have thought of his daughter Jiyoon while looking at Lee Jihye.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I didn&#x27;t say anything. I stayed by her side until she regained her heart.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah, you said a word.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu-ahjussi evaded her words as if he was embarrassed, and Kyung Sein cleared her throat and raised a solemn voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s okay to live.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu-ahjussi, who became contemplative, hurriedly added words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Anyone could say that!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">What anyone can say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there is also a person who lives without ever hearing what anyone can say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe Lee Jihye was similar.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Maritime War God&#x27; pays  favor to the incarnation.]</div>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' pays  favor to the incarnation.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seems that the role of the ahjussi’s is quite important in this world line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had a hunch.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that a small monster came running with a light barking sound from afar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We reflexively tried to pull out a sword, but when we realized the guy&#x27;s true identity, we were delighted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, Max.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the landlord’s rat, Max, that I saved in an emergency defense battle not too long ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It must have become friendly with humans in three days. Max played around us, sticking out its tongue.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellation &#x27;Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames &#x27; nods to the loyalty of the landlord.]</div>[Constellation 'Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames ' nods to the loyalty of the landlord.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I carefully stroked the rat’shead, I saw a boy waving at me from across the turnstile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Everyone is here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 7th apostle, Ye Hyunwoo, was waiting for us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is the dungeon cleanup over?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, it is over.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This side has just been cleaned up. All the injured have been moved downstairs.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo took turns looking at me and my party for a while before opening his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi, let&#x27;s talk for a moment…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">After asking for the understanding of the party for a while, I followed Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The place Ye Hyunwoo headed to was an unexpected place. The simple sign indicating gender was somehow unfamiliar. I felt the fact that the civilization I knew was destroyed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I didn&#x27;t know you could still use the bathroom.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. Electricity comes on. Water comes out. It&#x27;s like nothing has happened yet when I&#x27;m here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The toilet of the destroyed world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t really feel the need to urinate, so I stood there for a while, staring at the bathroom mirror.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All I can see is Cheon Inho&#x27;s face, pretending to be calm, narrowing his eyes, but since I&#x27;m still looking at this face, it seems like it&#x27;s worth looking at.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo, standing next to me, asked while washing his hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are the constellations looking at the bathroom too?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s written.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Restroom. A place where you can do your business out of sight, wash your hands, and groom yourself.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;the rice cake-eating tiger&#x27; says that he is a constellation that knows manners.]</div>[The constellation 'the rice cake-eating tiger' says that he is a constellation that knows manners.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">Perhaps, such &#x27;privacy&#x27; does not exist for mankind anymore.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized what the characters in this world are dealing with.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now, the word &#x27;alone&#x27; does not exist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I heard that Kim Dokja appeared.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A natural voice, like turning off the faucet in the bathroom.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I answered a beat late.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He suddenly appeared on the roof of the dungeon and gave people instructions. Thanks to those instructions, quite a few readers survived.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yeah, I heard that too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aren&#x27;t you curious?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, the boy&#x27;s face reflected in the mirror seemed as unfamiliar as the symbol of the toilet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I wondered how much I knew Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know who he really is. Whether he is a man or a woman, how old he is, what he has been doing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, maybe all that information is meaningless.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;None of the survivors of &#x27;Theatre Dungeon&#x27; saw Kim Dokja go up to the roof.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I recalled one after another the tragedies that took place in the &#x27;Theatre Dungeon&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of the readers pointing their swords at each other, and the Misreadings Association who killed people without hesitation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before entering the &#x27;Theatre Dungeon&#x27;, I had some trust in the 7th apostle, Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Dok-ja appeared &#x27;suddenly&#x27; as if he literally fell from the sky. You know what&#x27;s even more amazing?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then what about now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is Ye Hyunwoo still a trustworthy person?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo, lightly wiping off his hands, looked in the mirror and said,</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Even the constellations in the sky don&#x27;t know exactly what happened on the rooftop.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I felt a chill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How could Ye Hyunwoo, who is just an incarnation, already know the public opinion of the constellations?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Beyond the mirror, Ye Hyunwoo&#x27;s eyes were looking at me. At that moment, I felt the presence of several people in the compartment inside the bathroom.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I sang &#x27;Thoughts&#x27; in my head, Ye Hyunwoo asked me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27; by any chance?&quot;</p>
