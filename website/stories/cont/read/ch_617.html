<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Exactly three days have passed since the incident in the Theater Dungeon. During those three days, the name that hit Chungmuro Station was as follows.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Kim Dokja!"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Although some people just tilted their heads upon hearing his name. Some could not contain their joy.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Really? Is there really Kim Dokja here?"」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"I lived. We're alive now."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, not everyone who remembered his name was happy.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Is he really Dokja Kim? Doesn't it just become more dangerous if we get entangled?"」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Would anything change if Kim Dokja appeared now? To be honest, we all know what Kim Dokja knows."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Some people doubted the reality of the rumors, while others dismissed them as not a big deal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, whoever stood on either side, those who remembered 'Kim Dokja' would have thought of him and looked up at the sky for a moment.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「And with that, Lee Hakhyun thought it was enough.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The roof of the theater dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After sighing lightly, I looked up at the sky, and the sun was setting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Until all the scenarios were over, how many times did Kim Dokja look up at the sky?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking at you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is looking at you]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Watching the stars in the sky decrease, what did Kim Dokja think until the end?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I looked back, Kyung Sein and Lee Dansu were waiting for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is the dungeon cleanup over?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. It seems there are no people left now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Right after the theater dungeon ended, we cleaned up the acquired items and transported the injured readers to the bottom of the theater.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There are no posters left, and the dungeon errors seem to be almost normalized."</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were some people who couldn't get out of the movie even after the dungeon was cleared, perhaps because of the probability aftermath that occurred on the roof of the theater.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, some readers, including Kyung Sein and Lee Dansu, actively cooperated with me, and after a few days of desperate struggle, we succeeded in rescuing all those trapped in the dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How is the status of the 2 apostles?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Fortunately, Killer King fell asleep after eating the 'Elaine Forest Spirit'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King who I was worried about is also in good shape. I sighed lightly as I recalled Killer King fighting against the 'Lord of the Cretaceous Period'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you okay, Inho-ssi? There are more than 10 pills of Elaine’s Spirit of the Forest that you used this time..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Elaine Forest Spirit' is an item that costs 500 coins each. It wasn't a small expenditure for me either, but it was well worth the money I spent saving readers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, this kind of expense comes back with sponsorship.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you okay? Aren't you two hurt?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"As you can see, I’m safe."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein gave strength to her small biceps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu-ahjussi asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is your friend okay?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey, what… I haven’t done anything in particular."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Officially, I was known to have passed out and woke up in a corner of the rooftop garden.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, it was officially said that it was, and unofficially, it was as follows.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I became Kim Dokja for a while.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know why I did that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But at that moment, I couldn't help but do it. Maybe not me, but anyone else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were people thrown into the perishing world, and there was a person they had been waiting for.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And only I knew the secrets of this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had no choice but to lie.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because I don't want them to give up on life. I'm not saying it's for anyone, because I want them to continue to endure this cadaveric scenario with me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I needed readers, and I wanted them to live on. That's all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you find anything on the roof? I heard that the battle was here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Currently, it is known that there was a confrontation between Kim Dokja, Yoo Jonghyuk, Jung Heewon, and the owner of the theater in the 'theater dungeon' around Chungmuro Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yeah, well... nothing special."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was fortunate for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was because my head hurt to explain the things I met and fought with Han Sooyoung here one by one.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' asks what the hell happened.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellation,  Rice Cake-eating Tiger' asks if anyone has secured the video.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon ' asks what the dokkaebi was doing.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed that the constellations were unable to properly grasp the situation, perhaps due to the influence of the 'probability aftermath' that blew on the rooftop at the time. To say that no one had really seen that great battle, I felt a bit regretful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a clash with 'Han Sooyoung', not another person.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation that has not yet revealed their modifier smiles lightly.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">You never know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Has anyone seen this guy?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Really… Was Kim Dokja here? Did you see him, Inho-ssi?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I inadvertently looked back at the place where I fought with Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thinking back, it was a dizzying battle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was defeated by her sword, and pierced through the heart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I definitely remember dying there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I woke up again, I was lying on the roof with my wounds healed. The wound was also fully recovered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps Han Sooyoung brought me back to life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did she treat me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">And where did she go?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel the eyes of two people looking at me behind my back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wouldn't it be nice for these people to be sluggish?</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, there was no Kim Dokja here. Being here was just that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, I saw him too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked back at the two of them with a grin.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Obviously there was Kim Dokja.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Honesty isn't always a good thing. We often have to let go of life with lies. Maybe that's why you read the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I felt like I knew a little bit why Han Sooyoung brought me back to life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Come down."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I walked with my hands on the shoulders of the two of them. I looked back to where I had been standing for the last time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I really wish it was you who were there.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Two blue eyes appeared from the pitch-black darkness of space.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【They are here.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Starting with him, other eyes appeared all over the universe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Red or blue, eyes engraved with a story of their own. A majesty that swung from beyond the void permeated every aspect of its eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The pupils were all looking at one world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The world line they watched for a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is the forgotten 41st world, and the last 'blank space' allowed to be modified by the 'last wall'.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Those who saw the oldest dream.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">An electric sound was heard from the other side of the universe. The light of thought resounding in a place where there is no medium.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The nameless ones howled in pain, and the enraged deities of the other world roared with hateful rage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The outer gods representing all the abandoned things in the world were talking.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Kim Dokja Company.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The universe vibrated ominously. Foreigners' eyes turned to Earth. The far-off legend in his gaze engulfed the entire galaxy andlS wriggled.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Calm down. It is not yet time for you to move.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Someone interrupted them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A being wearing a white coat was handling the burden of outer gods on behalf of Earth.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Are you going to ruin the final chapter?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was RepresentativeKimDokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The outer god who confirmed his appearance uttered a truth all at once.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【You promised.】</p></div>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Kim Dokja’s Company should not exist here.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then, RepresentativeKimDokja shook his head.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【I am the one who called 'Kim Dokja’s Company' here.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As if he couldn't understand the words, the intensity of the story bent once again in the space.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in the midst of suffocating sparks, RepresentativeKimDokja continued with a calm expression.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【This story can only be completed without them, did you forget? As long as they exist, the universe you want will never arrive.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">For the first time, the momentum of the outer god slowed down at his remarks.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【They will all die here. With the 'oldest dream' they loved.'】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja, with a sweet smile, continued talking while appeasing the outer god.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【So please wait a bit. The final chapter will be prepared for you soon.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The eyes of the outer gods trembled lightly, and one by one they closed their heavy eyelids.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The turbulence of the stories, in which the gazes that oppressed the earth were shaken, calmed down little by little.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the eyes closed for the last time, a voice as deep as the deep sea resounded.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【The unrecorded story will watch over you.】</p></div>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as I went down to Chungmuro Station, a message appeared in front of my eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Main Scenario #3 - Emergency defense battle has ended.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You got 2,000 coins as a reward.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I forgot about the 'emergency defense battle'. The third scenario that was about to end early due to the 'venomous fog' that was sprayed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have made a decisive contribution to the 'emergency defense battle'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You got an additional 2,000 coins as a reward.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your first story related to this scenario is germinating.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">First story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw the message last time, but I was nervous.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because it was very important what one could gain from a birth story in this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja's first tale was 'The King of a Kingless World'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What is my first story?</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I checked the message log, there were a lot of unread  messages piled up.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The progress of the main scenario is being delayed due to the aftermath of probability.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The fourth main scenario will be announced in an hour.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently, there are 48 unread  messages.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">From scenario delay messages to indirect messages from various constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, it seems that the aftermath of the probability that blew into the rooftop garden was great.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's to the extent that the progress of the 'main scenario' is delayed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this was the case, the Management Bureau would have been talking about it, but no, it wasn't just the Management Bureau.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The nebula &lt;Tamra&gt; is paying attention to you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I laughed bitterly inwardly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know if I should like this kind of message or be anxious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wow, Inho-ssi. Now..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein was surprised and started talking. Apparently, the message was completely public.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"As expected, Inho-ssi went to the last floor, so it must be different. Me and ahjussi couldn’t go that far…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">She said, "What floor did he say you went to?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The 7th floor."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, the 7th floor was also a great result. That's because it's almost as if it's been uploaded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wait for a sec. By the way, what if it's on the 7th floor?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did yo go into 'that movie' by any chance?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who knew what the movie was about, nodded as if she had been waiting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yeah! Inho-ssi should have seen it too!" Being summoned! Load! Launch! Ku Kwa Kwa Kwah! Two-quake-quake-quawa!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">How can you describe the legendary Battle of Myeongnyang in that way?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Aside from Kyung Sein’s vocabulary, honestly, I was a little envious seeing her in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It must not have been easy to convince Lee Jihye."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah, that's right. Ahjussi and I worked hard to encourage her. You know what Kim Dokja  did."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You did that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">From what I remember, I don't think Kim Dokja did 'encourage' Lee Jihye. Rather, didn't he awaken her in a very dangerous way?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps conscious of my gaze, Kyung Sein smiled and looked back at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hee hee, I didn't do it exactly, but you... My words didn't work."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was as if I had a vague idea of what had happened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu-Ahjussi might have thought of his daughter Jiyoon while looking at Lee Jihye.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn't say anything. I stayed by her side until she regained her heart."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah, you said a word."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu-ahjussi evaded her words as if he was embarrassed, and Kyung Sein cleared her throat and raised a solemn voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s okay to live."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu-ahjussi, who became contemplative, hurriedly added words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Anyone could say that!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">What anyone can say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there is also a person who lives without ever hearing what anyone can say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe Lee Jihye was similar.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' pays  favor to the incarnation.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It seems that the role of the ahjussi’s is quite important in this world line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had a hunch.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that a small monster came running with a light barking sound from afar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We reflexively tried to pull out a sword, but when we realized the guy's true identity, we were delighted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, Max."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the landlord’s rat, Max, that I saved in an emergency defense battle not too long ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It must have become friendly with humans in three days. Max played around us, sticking out its tongue.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellation 'Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames ' nods to the loyalty of the landlord.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As I carefully stroked the rat’shead, I saw a boy waving at me from across the turnstile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Everyone is here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 7th apostle, Ye Hyunwoo, was waiting for us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is the dungeon cleanup over?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, it is over."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This side has just been cleaned up. All the injured have been moved downstairs."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo took turns looking at me and my party for a while before opening his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi, let's talk for a moment…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">After asking for the understanding of the party for a while, I followed Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The place Ye Hyunwoo headed to was an unexpected place. The simple sign indicating gender was somehow unfamiliar. I felt the fact that the civilization I knew was destroyed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn't know you could still use the bathroom."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. Electricity comes on. Water comes out. It's like nothing has happened yet when I'm here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The toilet of the destroyed world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't really feel the need to urinate, so I stood there for a while, staring at the bathroom mirror.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All I can see is Cheon Inho's face, pretending to be calm, narrowing his eyes, but since I'm still looking at this face, it seems like it's worth looking at.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo, standing next to me, asked while washing his hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are the constellations looking at the bathroom too?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's written."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Restroom. A place where you can do your business out of sight, wash your hands, and groom yourself.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'the rice cake-eating tiger' says that he is a constellation that knows manners.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' says he won't stop looking.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' warns everyone to leave the channel.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps, such 'privacy' does not exist for mankind anymore.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized what the characters in this world are dealing with.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now, the word 'alone' does not exist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I heard that Kim Dokja appeared."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A natural voice, like turning off the faucet in the bathroom.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I answered a beat late.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He suddenly appeared on the roof of the dungeon and gave people instructions. Thanks to those instructions, quite a few readers survived."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yeah, I heard that too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aren't you curious?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, the boy's face reflected in the mirror seemed as unfamiliar as the symbol of the toilet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I wondered how much I knew Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know who he really is. Whether he is a man or a woman, how old he is, what he has been doing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, maybe all that information is meaningless.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"None of the survivors of 'Theatre Dungeon' saw Kim Dokja go up to the roof."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I recalled one after another the tragedies that took place in the 'Theatre Dungeon'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of the readers pointing their swords at each other, and the Misreadings Association who killed people without hesitation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before entering the 'Theatre Dungeon', I had some trust in the 7th apostle, Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dok-ja appeared 'suddenly' as if he literally fell from the sky. You know what's even more amazing?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then what about now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is Ye Hyunwoo still a trustworthy person?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo, lightly wiping off his hands, looked in the mirror and said,</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even the constellations in the sky don't know exactly what happened on the rooftop."</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I felt a chill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How could Ye Hyunwoo, who is just an incarnation, already know the public opinion of the constellations?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Beyond the mirror, Ye Hyunwoo's eyes were looking at me. At that moment, I felt the presence of several people in the compartment inside the bathroom.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I sang 'Thoughts' in my head, Ye Hyunwoo asked me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you 'Kim Dokja' by any chance?"</p>
