<br>
<p class="orv_line">My understanding of Yoo Joonghyuk has increased. It wasn&#x27;t hard to find the reason.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps the comments left by kkoma Kim Dokjas had some kind of influence on me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Is the 41st turn Yoo Joonghyuk really a bad guy?」</div>「Is the 41st turn Yoo Joonghyuk really a bad guy?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard those words, it was like hundreds of circuits in my head lit up at once.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;I lost a bad shield.&quot;」</div>「"I lost a bad shield."」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;In the future, sea battles will be a bit difficult.&quot;」</div>「"In the future, sea battles will be a bit difficult."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">In my head, the lines I had written for Yoo Joonghyuk popped up. In those lines, he was more of</p>
<p class="orv_line">a villain than a good guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Moreover, Shin Yooseung from the 41st turn had also expressed her deep disappointment in Yoo</p>
<p class="orv_line">Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what was the Yoo Joonghyuk I peeped at in the theater of my dream like?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;The marginalized group can come out in peace. I&#x27;ll show you how to get food from now on.&quot;」</div>「"The marginalized group can come out in peace. I'll show you how to get food from now on."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">And what about the 40th turn Yoo Joonghyuk I saw through Anna Croft?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;If the world were to repeat itself once more, would you be willing to live a different life?&quot;」</div>「"If the world were to repeat itself once more, would you be willing to live a different life?"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Can I really categorize Yoo Joonghyuk as a &#x27;villain&#x27;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the slow-moving time of the Snowfield, I acknowledged that the words I read and wrote were</p>
<p class="orv_line">only a part of the life Yoo Joonghyuk lived. This is especially true for the 41st turn Yoo</p>
<p class="orv_line">Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was only one sentence I could write about him now.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I don&#x27;t know Yoo Joonghyuk.」</div>「I don't know Yoo Joonghyuk.」</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">[Your understanding of the character &#x27;Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27; has increased slightly.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">I calmly closed my eyes and thought about the Yoo Joonghyuk I had seen with my own eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The closest person to the current Yoo Joonghyuk was the Yoo Joonghyuk I saw in the 40th turn</p>
<p class="orv_line">in the &#x27;Phantom Prison&#x27;, and the Yoo Joonghyuk who left two &#x27;Elaine Forest Essence&#x27; beads at</p>

<p class="orv_line">I thought again.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">20 characters. Barely enough to describe a single line of character behavior.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In those 20 characters, what can I express about Yoo Joonghyuk?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I often had this problem when I was writing Omniscient Reader. When I couldn&#x27;t write the right</p>
<p class="orv_line">line or action for a character.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Just write it.&quot;」</div>「"Just write it."」</p>

<p class="orv_line">The faint spark in Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s right hand was the effect of my sentence.</p>

<p class="orv_line">why he suddenly did what he did.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From here, it was up to Yoo Joonghyuk</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Yoo Joonghyuk I saw. The unfortunate protagonist who wanted to save the world, even by</p>

<p class="orv_line">Sword Lee Hyunsung had trouble blocking. Even if Yoo Joonghyuk was a monster who</p>
<p class="orv_line">slaughtered a 7th grade monster species, there was no way he would be safe if he was hit by a</p>

<p class="orv_line">His expression was one of deep confusion. Maybe it was the sentence I wrote that shook his</p>
<p class="orv_line">judgment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that was enough, Yoo Joonghyuk already did his part.</p>

<br>
<p class="orv_line">Kwaaaaang!</p>
<p class="orv_line">I blocked Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s way by a hair&#x27;s breadth. The impact felt like it would shatter my</p>

<p class="orv_line">But I held on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was able to hold on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because my strength level was now higher than Lee Hyunsung&#x27;s.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yoo Joonghyuk. Wise decision. You must never kill Gong Pildu to achieve what you want.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I glanced back, Yoo Joonghyuk was looking at me in surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why are you looking at me like that? You said we&#x27;d be on the same side sometime.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know what the 41st turn Yoo Joonghyuk will go through in the future.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know what tragedy he&#x27;s been through, what despair he&#x27;s been through, or how he&#x27;s come</p>

<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">My sudden entry caused a lull in the station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, Yoo Joonghyuk stepped back as if to observe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, Lee Jihye and the others were looking at me with wide eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#x27;m at my limit. Guys.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, they weren&#x27;t the only ones who were surprised.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You...... What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu asked, and I replied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m Cheon Inho.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who wants to know your stupid name?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The growling Gong Pildu showed signs of charging his mini-turret again, so I quickly added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you don&#x27;t mind, I&#x27;d like to have a word with the person behind you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At my words, the boy who had been hiding behind Gong Pildu&#x27;s back poked his head out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I waved to the boy who made eye contact.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hello?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy quickly hid again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An unfamiliar face.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">In the entirety of Omniscient Reader, there had never been a boy like him by Gong Pildu&#x27;s side.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Using &#x27;Readers&#x27; Comments List&#x27; in this person.]</div>[Using 'Readers' Comments List' in this person.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">Just by looking at it, I already knew what kind of person he would be.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hmm, so he&#x27;s like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While I was quickly checking the reader&#x27;s information, Gong Pildu looked back at the boy and</p>
<p class="orv_line">asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you know him?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy shook his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait. Think again.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s not good enough.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, a wonderful reader of mine once told me how to deal with a situation like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aren&#x27;t we &#x27;between friends&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Friends......?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Between friends.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, the boy&#x27;s expression changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before I knew it, the rest of the party was standing next to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy looked back and forth between me and my group a few times, and his eyes widened</p>
<p class="orv_line">when he realized that Jung Heewon was among us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Slowly, the boy&#x27;s small lips opened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;9158......?&quot;</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">A moment later, I was grabbed by the nape of my neck by Yoo Joonghyuk and dragged toward</p>
<p class="orv_line">the railroad tracks.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I&#x27;m used to this by now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, I could see the boy talking to my party.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A few steps away from him, Gong Pildu was staring at this side with disapproving eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk looked at Gong Pildu and asked without even glancing at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How did you convince him?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because a villain knows best about villains.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheon Inho.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m The One Who Deceived the Stars, and the Evil Sophist.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk looked back at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What you need is not the human Cheon Inho, but the &#x27;Ten Evil&#x27; that tormented you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk suspects that I am not Cheon Inho. The best I can do now is to convince him of</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;my&#x27; usefulness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How can I trust you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Weren&#x27;t you the one who trusted me and asked me to be on the same side?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you recover the memories of the previous turn? Looks like you managed to meet Anna</p>
<p class="orv_line">Croft.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, he seems to be able to communicate to some extent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, Kim Dokja was right. There is no such thing as a bad Yoo Joonghyuk in the world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But the situation has changed from the previous turn. It was a ridiculous idea to join hands with</p>
<p class="orv_line">a Ten Evil after all.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">There may be a liar Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly added before Yoo Joonghyuk could grab a spear and stab me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#x27;t think too much. This isn&#x27;t the time to be picky with your colleagues. Are you thinking of</p>
<p class="orv_line">hitting the reset button again?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t know everything that happened in the 40th turn. What I heard was only</p>
<p class="orv_line">part of the conversation between Yoo Joonghyuk and Cheon Inho.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">But for now, it&#x27;s enough for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Didn&#x27;t you say yourself that this was the last time you could reset and that everything in the</p>
<p class="orv_line">universe would be destroyed in this turn? Was it all a lie?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s eyes shook wildly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Honestly, you don&#x27;t seem very desperate right now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a moment of silence, Yoo Joonghyuk stared into the darkness of the tunnel, as if there was</p>
<p class="orv_line">a fierce enemy beyond it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I need a moment to think.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With that, Yoo Joonghyuk started to tap the railroad tracks with the tip of his spear and began to</p>
<p class="orv_line">pace.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I left him alone with his thoughts and approached the others.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy from Chungmuro was already exchanging information with the others, especially</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, which he seemed to be extremely close to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is the 41st turn?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, that&#x27;s right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh my God. So that&#x27;s why that Yoo Joonghyuk...... No wonder he was such a scum.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had a general idea of what they were talking about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, the boy didn&#x27;t know how many turns Yoo Joonghyuk had passed through.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The mumbling boy spotted me and jumped up from his seat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein introduced the boy to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi! This is the 7th Apostle from the Seven Apostles!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 7th Apostle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Like Killer King, this boy was also a member of the Seven Apostles. If he was the 7th Apostle,</p>
<p class="orv_line">he must be the last of the Apostles.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I extended my hand, and the boy nervously shook it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, hello.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, it&#x27;s nice to meet you.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So this is what Cheon Inho looks like...... He&#x27;s much more handsome than what I&#x27;ve read.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grasped the boy&#x27;s small hand and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the first compliment I heard since I possessed Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thank you. Why don&#x27;t we start by introducing ourselves? I&#x27;m Cheon Inho, as you know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m Ye Hyunwoo.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s your name, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Listening to the name, I seemed to remember that there was a character with that name in</p>
<p class="orv_line">Chungmuro&#x27;s setting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo&#x27;s sparkling eyes looked closely at my face, and then he asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But how did you know I was an apostle?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">How did I know.</p>

<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#x27;t help but know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Once I checked the platform, it was clear he wasn&#x27;t an illegal reader, and more importantly, this</p>
<p class="orv_line">boy had over 50 reads.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He&#x27;s not like Killer King with 99.8 complete reads (almost 100 reads), but he&#x27;s definitely like 0.5</p>
<p class="orv_line">of him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So I thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyone who has read the novel this many times is 100% a member of &#x27;that organization&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I recently met someone who seemed to have a similar vibe.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Killer King.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The 2nd Apostle? You&#x27;re saying I&#x27;m like him?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo blushed as if he had heard something inaudible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Seeing him like this, he was more likeable than that wannabe Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I actually heard from him. I heard there was a reader possessing a supporting villain. I guess it</p>
<p class="orv_line">was Cheon Inho-ssi. Anyway, that bastard&#x27;s always trying to be meaningful. Cheon Inho.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Killer King has been here?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s been a while. He even asked me to go with him, but I&#x27;m not the adventurous type.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Certainly, his choice to have Gong Pildu as his partner made that clear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Safety first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A wise choice in an apocalypse like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;By the way, thanks for stopping me earlier. If I had known that he was the 41st turn Yoo</p>
<p class="orv_line">Joonghyuk, I would have never fought him. Damn Killer King, he didn&#x27;t even tell me that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King doesn&#x27;t know that either. Reader-nim.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, this reader is not very normal either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if he didn&#x27;t know it was the 41st turn, I can&#x27;t believe someone who&#x27;s read Omniscient</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reader 50 times thought of fighting Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That part is a bit complicated.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo said in a weak voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m at the third stage of the tech tree[2] 「Plan to Raise an Invincible Castellan at Home」. I</p>
<p class="orv_line">should have been able to cover Yoo Joonghyuk by now, according to my calculations.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">What...... Plan?</p>
<p class="orv_line">After letting out a deep sigh, Ye Hyunwoo said an unexpected name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Fuck, if Jiyoon was with me, I wouldn&#x27;t have made this mistake.&quot;</p>
