            <div class="orv_title"><h1>591 Episode 8.Representative Kim Dokja (1)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">My understanding of Yoo Joonghyuk has increased. It wasn't hard to find the reason.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps the comments left by kkoma Kim Dokjas had some kind of influence on me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Is the 41st turn Yoo Joonghyuk really a bad guy? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard those words, it was like hundreds of circuits in my head lit up at once.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I lost a bad shield." 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "In the future, sea battles will be a bit difficult." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In my head, the lines I had written for Yoo Joonghyuk popped up. In those lines, he was more of a villain than a good guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Moreover, Shin Yooseung from the 41st turn had also expressed her deep disappointment in Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what was the Yoo Joonghyuk I peeped at in the theater of my dream like?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "The marginalized group can come out in peace. I'll show you how to get food from now on." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And what about the 40th turn Yoo Joonghyuk I saw through Anna Croft?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "If the world were to repeat itself once more, would you be willing to live a different life?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Can I really categorize Yoo Joonghyuk as a 'villain'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the slow-moving time of the Snowfield, I acknowledged that the words I read and wrote were only a part of the life Yoo Joonghyuk lived. This is especially true for the 41st turn Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was only one sentence I could write about him now.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I don't know Yoo Joonghyuk.</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your understanding of the character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has increased slightly.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are now able to write about the character 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I checked the window in front of me, like checking the first footprints in the Snowfield.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p># Protagonist's Choice</p>
<p>「At that moment, Yoo Joonghyuk ■■.......」</p>
<p>* At your current skill level, you can write a total of 20 additional characters.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Only 20 caracteres.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was all I could write about 'Yoo Joonghyuk' at the moment.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your understanding of the character is low.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The number of times you can describe this scene is limited.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can only describe the scene once.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I only got one chance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I calmly closed my eyes and thought about the Yoo Joonghyuk I had seen with my own eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The closest person to the current Yoo Joonghyuk was the Yoo Joonghyuk I saw in the 40th turn in the 'Phantom Prison', and the Yoo Joonghyuk who left two 'Elaine Forest Essence' beads at Geumho Station.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your understanding of the character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has increased slightly.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I thought.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your understanding of the character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has increased slightly.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I thought again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">20 characters. Barely enough to describe a single line of character behavior.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In those 20 characters, what can I express about Yoo Joonghyuk?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I often had this problem when I was writing Omniscient Reader. When I couldn't write the right line or action for a character.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Just write it." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At such times, Ji Eunyoo would say.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Trust the characters who have lived in the world you created, and just write it." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Once again, all I could do was helplessly believe her words.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Believe in Yoo Joonghyuk, who has lived in this world. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I wrote a sentence for him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't much, really.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that one line was all I understood about him and all I could give him now.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This story is plausible.]</p></div>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[Do you want to check the reader's feedback?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>rlaehrwk37: Yoo Joonghyuk is Yoo Joonghyuk</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">I read that feedback wordlessly. I couldn't tell from the feedback whether this 'reproduction' would be successful or not.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All I can say now is that I'm on the same page as KimDokja37.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Successfully recreating the scene.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Leaving the 'Snowfield'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The colorless time scattered. The guns of the mini-turrets were about to fire.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 At that moment, Yoo Joonghyuk put down the spear. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The faint spark in Yoo Joonghyuk's right hand was the effect of my sentence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, when he released the spear from his hand, he looked confused. He didn't understand why he suddenly did what he did.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From here, it was up to Yoo Joonghyuk</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Yoo Joonghyuk I saw. The unfortunate protagonist who wanted to save the world, even by joining hands with a villain.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 In fact, Yoo Joonghyuk knew. He knew that he shouldn't kill Gong Pildu right now. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Because this would be his last turn. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The mini-turrets that had finished charging spewed out fire. It was a shell that even the Steel Sword Lee Hyunsung had trouble blocking. Even if Yoo Joonghyuk was a monster who slaughtered a 7th grade monster species, there was no way he would be safe if he was hit by a series of turrets like that.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Seven turrets in total. If they all hit at the same time, even Yoo Joonghyuk will be in danger. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But Yoo Joonghyuk didn't move. He didn't even hold his spear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His expression was one of deep confusion. Maybe it was the sentence I wrote that shook his judgment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that was enough, Yoo Joonghyuk already did his part.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, this time,</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.4' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was my turn to take responsibility for my words.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Turn into an 'Old Iron Shield'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time as I used Incite, 'Thoughts of Almost Everything' glowed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When Yoo Joonghyuk looked up, the shells were already in front of him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kwaaaaang!</p>
<p class="orv_line">I blocked Yoo Joonghyuk's way by a hair's breadth. The impact felt like it would shatter my shield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I held on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was able to hold on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because my strength level was now higher than Lee Hyunsung's.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Joonghyuk. Wise decision. You must never kill Gong Pildu to achieve what you want."</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I glanced back, Yoo Joonghyuk was looking at me in surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why are you looking at me like that? You said we'd be on the same side sometime."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know what the 41st turn Yoo Joonghyuk will go through in the future.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know what tragedy he's been through, what despair he's been through, or how he's come to this conclusion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I can see it in his face now.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 This world may not end in tragedy. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I smirked at Yoo Joonghyuk, ending the conversation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll show you how I was able to make the Ten Evils my allies."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Kwaaaaang!</p>
<p class="orv_line">A distant bang. Watching Cheon Inho take the shells, the woman in the white coat frowned in the darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She bit the lemon candy on her mouth and muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The more I look at him, the crazier he is."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' chuckles.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"What did he think he was doing, running right up to him? Did he forget that he's Cheon Inho?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' says that he misses it.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The woman pursed her lips for a long time at those words, and then muttered through her teeth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"......I don't miss him one bit."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' says they never said they missed someone.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Shut up."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">My sudden entry caused a lull in the station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, Yoo Joonghyuk stepped back as if to observe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, Lee Jihye and the others were looking at me with wide eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I'm at my limit. Guys.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, they weren't the only ones who were surprised.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You...... What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu asked, and I replied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm Cheon Inho."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who wants to know your stupid name?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The growling Gong Pildu showed signs of charging his mini-turret again, so I quickly added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you don't mind, I'd like to have a word with the person behind you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">At my words, the boy who had been hiding behind Gong Pildu's back poked his head out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I waved to the boy who made eye contact.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hello?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy quickly hid again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An unfamiliar face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the entirety of Omniscient Reader, there had never been a boy like him by Gong Pildu's side.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Using 'Readers' Comments List' in this person.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Checking the reader's profile information.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Just by looking at it, I already knew what kind of person he would be.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hmm, so he's like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While I was quickly checking the reader's information, Gong Pildu looked back at the boy and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you know him?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy shook his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait. Think again."</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's not good enough.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, a wonderful reader of mine once told me how to deal with a situation like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aren't we 'between friends'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Friends......?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Between friends."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, the boy's expression changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before I knew it, the rest of the party was standing next to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy looked back and forth between me and my group a few times, and his eyes widened when he realized that Jung Heewon was among us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Slowly, the boy's small lips opened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"9158......?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">A moment later, I was grabbed by the nape of my neck by Yoo Joonghyuk and dragged toward the railroad tracks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I'm used to this by now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, I could see the boy talking to my party.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A few steps away from him, Gong Pildu was staring at this side with disapproving eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk looked at Gong Pildu and asked without even glancing at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How did you convince him?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Because a villain knows best about villains."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Cheon Inho......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm The One Who Deceived the Stars, and the Evil Sophist."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk looked back at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What you need is not the human Cheon Inho, but the 'Ten Evil' that tormented you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk suspects that I am not Cheon Inho. The best I can do now is to convince him of 'my' usefulness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How can I trust you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Weren't you the one who trusted me and asked me to be on the same side?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you recover the memories of the previous turn? Looks like you managed to meet Anna Croft."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, he seems to be able to communicate to some extent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, Kim Dokja was right. There is no such thing as a bad Yoo Joonghyuk in the world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But the situation has changed from the previous turn. It was a ridiculous idea to join hands with a Ten Evil after all."</p>
<p class="orv_line">There may be a liar Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly added before Yoo Joonghyuk could grab a spear and stab me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't think too much. This isn't the time to be picky with your colleagues. Are you thinking of hitting the reset button again?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unfortunately, I don't know everything that happened in the 40th turn. What I heard was only part of the conversation between Yoo Joonghyuk and Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But for now, it's enough for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Didn't you say yourself that this was the last time you could reset and that everything in the universe would be destroyed in this turn? Was it all a lie?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes shook wildly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Honestly, you don't seem very desperate right now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a moment of silence, Yoo Joonghyuk stared into the darkness of the tunnel, as if there was a fierce enemy beyond it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I need a moment to think."</p>
<p class="orv_line">With that, Yoo Joonghyuk started to tap the railroad tracks with the tip of his spear and began to pace.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I left him alone with his thoughts and approached the others.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy from Chungmuro was already exchanging information with the others, especially Kyung Sein, which he seemed to be extremely close to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This is the 41st turn?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, that's right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh my God. So that's why that Yoo Joonghyuk...... No wonder he was such a scum......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had a general idea of what they were talking about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, the boy didn't know how many turns Yoo Joonghyuk had passed through.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The mumbling boy spotted me and jumped up from his seat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein introduced the boy to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi! This is the 7th Apostle from the Seven Apostles!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 7th Apostle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Like Killer King, this boy was also a member of the Seven Apostles. If he was the 7th Apostle, he must be the last of the Apostles.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I extended my hand, and the boy nervously shook it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, hello."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, it's nice to meet you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"So this is what Cheon Inho looks like...... He's much more handsome than what I've read."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grasped the boy's small hand and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the first compliment I heard since I possessed Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you. Why don't we start by introducing ourselves? I'm Cheon Inho, as you know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm Ye Hyunwoo."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's your name, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Listening to the name, I seemed to remember that there was a character with that name in Chungmuro's setting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo's sparkling eyes looked closely at my face, and then he asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But how did you know I was an apostle?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">How did I know.</p>

<p class="orv_line">I couldn't help but know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Once I checked the platform, it was clear he wasn't an illegal reader, and more importantly, this boy had over 50 reads.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He's not like Killer King with 99.8 complete reads (almost 100 reads), but he's definitely like 0.5 of him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So I thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyone who has read the novel this many times is 100% a member of 'that organization'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I recently met someone who seemed to have a similar vibe."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Killer King."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The 2nd Apostle? You're saying I'm like him?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo blushed as if he had heard something inaudible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Seeing him like this, he was more likeable than that wannabe Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I actually heard from him. I heard there was a reader possessing a supporting villain. I guess it was Cheon Inho-ssi. Anyway, that bastard's always trying to be meaningful. Cheon Inho......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Killer King has been here?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's been a while. He even asked me to go with him, but I'm not the adventurous type."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Certainly, his choice to have Gong Pildu as his partner made that clear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Safety first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A wise choice in an apocalypse like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"By the way, thanks for stopping me earlier. If I had known that he was the 41st turn Yoo Joonghyuk, I would have never fought him. Damn Killer King, he didn't even tell me that."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King doesn't know that either. Reader-nim.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, this reader is not very normal either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if he didn't know it was the 41st turn, I can't believe someone who's read Omniscient Reader 50 times thought of fighting Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That part is a bit complicated."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo said in a weak voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm at the third stage of the tech tree² 「Plan to Raise an Invincible Castellan at Home」. I should have been able to cover Yoo Joonghyuk by now, according to my calculations......."</p>

<p class="orv_line">What...... Plan?</p>
<p class="orv_line">After letting out a deep sigh, Ye Hyunwoo said an unexpected name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Fuck, if Jiyoon was with me, I wouldn't have made this mistake."</p>
