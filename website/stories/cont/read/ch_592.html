<p class="orv_line">"D-did you just say Jiyoon?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi asked, and Ye Hyunwoo frowned warily.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Jiyoon! Do you know Jiyoon?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"She's my friend, why?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Where is Jiyoon now?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo looked in my direction, startled by ahjussi's sudden outburst.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I tried to calm ahjussi down as he breathed heavily.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"His daughter's name is 'No Jiyoon'."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo's eyes widened.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"No Jiyoon? Really?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After looking back and forth between me and the ahjussi, Ye Hyunwoo muttered in a cautious</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">voice.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"But it could be someone with the same name......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Hyunwoo-ssi, is your friend the same Jiyoon who said she's going to marry Yoo Joonghyuk in</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">the future?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In response to my question, Ye Hyunwoo nodded with a dazed expression.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh? That's right. Wow, you really are Jiyoon's father. No, but if you're here means Omniscient</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Reader......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Where is Jiyoon now?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">He was his daughter's first acquaintance he met since crossing over to this world. Dansoo ahjussi</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">was almost out of breath.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm sorry....... I haven't met Jiyoon since I came here either."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"But Jiyoon must be here somewhere too. I was dragged to the theater by her."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">At the mention of the theater, Kyung Sein asked.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you happen to be at 'Kim Dokja's Banquet' as well?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. Were you too?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I was there too......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, most of the readers in the theater were transmigrated into this world.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Even Dansoo ahjussi chimed in.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I was in the hospital when I was suddenly brought in......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">He was possessed even though he was outside the theater. Then maybe it wasn't just the people</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">in the theater who came.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo sighed and added.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"If I had known this would happen, I wouldn't have gone. I was in a really good mood until I got</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">the quiz right. I was looking forward to the gift since I got the difficult quiz right......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What did you get right?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, the meaning of 1,863......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, so that was the 7th Apostle."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I also vaguely remembered.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The person who, in a confident voice, correlated Yoo Joonghyuk's regressions with the year the</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">first subway opened.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe the girl sitting next to him was the one who asked if Kim Dokja was resurrected.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Then, was the girl who asked about Kim Dokja Jiyoon?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo sighed as if it was a habit already and glanced in the direction of Yoo Joonghyuk,</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">who was still pacing the railroad tracks.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I haven't seen Jiyoon since we got separated at that time. Of course I thought she'd be by Yoo</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Joonghyuk's side by now...... She doesn't seem to be possessing Jihye."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi's expression darkened sharply at the offhand remark.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Still, if it's Jiyoon, she's alive somewhere, so don't worry too much. There's no way such a tough</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">girl could be dead, and she's read the Book of Revelation more than I have."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I paused when I heard that.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jiyoon had read it more than 50 times?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As if to change the subject, Ye Hyunwoo smiled slightly.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"By the way, it's amazing that you've made it this far already. I've read it 50 times, but I was</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">lucky enough to start near Chungmuro, but you guys......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"We started at Geumho Station."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Wow, at 'Geumho Station'? Well, since you're 'Cheon Inho'...... So you met Jung Heewon there</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">too, right?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was talking to Lee Jihye a dozen steps away. Apparently, Lee Jihye took the</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">initiative to ask her questions.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's really unusual. Jung Heewon becoming a colleague with Cheon Inho... Is this development</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">okay?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">When he asked me that, I was speechless.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it was a novelty in terms of development.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Anyway, I'm relieved to see other members of the Apostles. It was really hard to deal with</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King when he came with a bunch of kids from the Misreading Association."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard those words, I remembered the dead bodies of the outer species at the front</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">of the tunnel. Apparently, it was the work of Ye Hyunwoo and Gong Pildu.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Did the Misreading Association attack here as well?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"You've already met them, right?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Thanks to Killer King."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Eh, that asshole...... Anyway, they came here as well. It seems like they prepared a lot for this</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">early rush. Of course, I think they definitely underestimated the third stage of my Invincible</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Castellan tech tree."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo seemed to have a special attachment to Gong Pildu and talked to us about his Plan</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">to Raise an Invisible Castellan at Home for a while.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder how much he talked.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I want to go home."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like I had been pricked by a thorn in the middle of the heart.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know how long it had been, but Ye Hyunwoo had tears in his eyes.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It belatedly dawned on me that Ye Hyunwoo was Jiyoon's age.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">On the surface, everyone seemed excited to be in a novel, but there was no way anyone would</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">really want to be in an apocalypse like this.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein clenched her fists, and Dansoo ahjussi, who had stood up from his seat, reached over</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">the boy's shoulder as if to comfort him.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that we heard a voice from behind him.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Stop talking and come here, kid."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo rushed over and sat down next to Gong Pildu. Ye Hyunwoo whimpered, and Gong</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Pildu glared at me like I was going to kill me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">He's only in his mid-to-late teens. Such a child endured the first and second scenarios and</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">survived to this point.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to tell him anything. That he would make it home safely. That nothing would happen.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">But who am I to say that?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Tsuchuchuchut.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Everyone's pockets vibrated with the same sound.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">One by one, with a slight time difference, we pulled out our phones.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">And then.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein's nervous voice.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">She wasn't the only one. Dansoo ahjussi and even Ye Hyunwoo, who was next to Gong Pildu,</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">had similar faces.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The same message appeared on everyone's phone's screen.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—It's been a while. Dear readers.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja sent a message.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"This, right nowᅳ"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly looked around.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was to see if we were the only ones looking at our phones.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's check it first."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I opened the message.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—Hello, dear readers. By now, you're either on the second scenario or, if you're fast, already on</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">the third.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">You've all survived well. Of course, some of you haven't, but what can I do? You should've read</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">it harder.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The strange coolness in the way they speak.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Is this really a message from the 'RepresentativeKimDokja' I know?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—I'm sure you're all wondering. Why me? Did I do something wrong to be transmigrated into</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">this world? Was it because I read that damn novel? But I didn't even say anything bad about it.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Who the hell put me in this world and why?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I had an ominous premonition.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Everyone! If you haven't seen the message yet—"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">But I didn't finish my sentence.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—I'm sure you're frustrated. So, for those readers who have made it this far, I thought I'd give a</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">little presentation on why you were brought to this world, and.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Tsuchuchuchut— I saw Kyung Sein, Dansoo ahjussi, and Ye Hyunwoo collapse one after</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">another like dolls with broken threads.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—What you must accomplish to return to your original world.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">My vision went black as well.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—See you soon then.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A dark tunnel.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The woman in the white coat, who had been watching Chungmuro Station with a lollipop in her</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">mouth, jumped up from her seat.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey, remember all the guys whose phones just rang."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' asks what's wrong with them.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"They're all possessed. Also."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The woman added, checking the faces of Cheon Inho and his party who fell down one by one.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Track the coordinates of the newly created subspace. Find out where their souls have been</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">called. Quickly."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">When I opened my eyes, I was lying in a large lobby. As I got up, I realized that my eye level</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">felt strangely familiar.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Slowly, my eyes adjusted and took in the scene around me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The unlit ticket office and unmanned ticket machine.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was Chungmuro's theater.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As I approached the ticket machine, I saw a face on the black screen.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">My face was in it. Not Cheon Inho's face, but Lee Hakhyun's face.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I laughed out loud, and a sense of sadness crossed my mind. A deep sense of relief washed over</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">me, along with an unexplainable sense of regret.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it was all a dream.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">There's no such thing as transmigrating into a novel, after all. There's no way something like a</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">web novel could suddenly happen to me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that the ceiling lit up.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A dazzling pillar of light descended from the surroundings, and people began to be summoned</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">one by one.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Uaaaah!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Some people screamed, while others looked around with calm faces.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">They appeared in an instant.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I realized who they were.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Readers. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The readers who had been transmigrated into the novel with me. It wasn't until I saw them that I</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">realized.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">We had all been called here, just as we were in the real world.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly counted the people. A number that seemed more than a hundred, even at a rough count.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, there were more possessed people from other places besides those in the theater.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I had counted about a hundred and twenty of them when I spotted a head that stood out from the</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">crowd.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't recognize anyone else, but I recognized them.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Sein-ssi."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Eh? Who?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The surprised man turned his head toward me, and I saw his name tag.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The man seemed to recognize my name tag as well.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I-Inho-ssi? You must be Inho-ssi!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"That's right."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Uaaah! Inho-ssi!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein swooped down and gave me a big hug.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly pulled away from him and asked.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you see the others?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, I don't know the others' real faces."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Well, that's true, too.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As if they had realized what was happening, the sounds of people searching echoed around the</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">room.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Mijin-ah! Seo Mijin!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"JihyesLove-nim! Is JihyesLove-nim here?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"NamwoonsMom-nim!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, there was someone I needed to find too. Maybe this was my only chance.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Sein-ssi. I have to go somewhere for a while too."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What? Inho-ssi! Wait!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I pushed my way through the crowd, checking people's faces one by one.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Ji Eunyoo-ssi! Is Ji Eunyoo-ssi here?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyoo, my assignment editor.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The one who brought me to this theater. She must have transmigrated here too, because she read</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Omniscient Reader and answered the quiz correctly.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Ji Eunyoo-ssi!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">But there was no sign of Ji Eunyoo.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Has she not been summoned yet?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Or........</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I bit my lip hard. It wasn't anyone else, it was 'Ji Eunyoo'. The one who had probably read my</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">novel more than me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">There's no way Ji Eunyoo didn't survive.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that I heard a familiar name.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Jiyoon-ah...... Jiyoon-ah!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A neatly dressed middle-aged man was crouched on the ground, calling for someone desperately.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As I approached, the middle-aged man looked up at me. It wasn't a face I remembered, but the</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">moment I saw those eyes, I was sure.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho...... Mate?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was the unmistakable Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The real-life Dansoo ahjussi was just as handsome as the novel version.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The only difference was that this man looked so pale that it wouldn't be strange if he collapsed</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">immediately, and his body was built like a dry tree.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm sorry, mate, Jiyoon. Jiyoon, please......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi fainted on the spot leaving those words. His head was burning with fever. I</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">hastily carried him on my back. His body was as light as a child's.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I looked around nervously.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Should I take him to the hospital?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">But there was no way I could get there.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The theater's exits and elevators were blocked by translucent walls.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">This wasn't the 'theater' we knew, but a subspace someone temporarily created.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">There was no way to escape.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">There was only one thing I could do now.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Jiyoon-ah! No Jiyoon!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I started shouting at the top of my lungs to the surrounding area. Kyung Sein, who hurriedly</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">catched up, realized what was going on and shouted Jiyoon's name together with me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Jiyoon-ah, where are you!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Time and time again, I saw children who looked like Jiyoon's age, but I couldn't find Jiyoon.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Soon, all the pillars of light disappeared.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The summoning was finally over.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The next moment, I stopped dead in my tracks, feeling a strange sense of heavy pressure. It was</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">hard to breathe, and my head felt dizzy.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Something is looking at us. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I lifted my head with difficulty, as if defying gravity.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Since when.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Someone was floating in the ceiling of the theater.</p>

<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Let's see. You're all here at last.】</p></div>
<br>
