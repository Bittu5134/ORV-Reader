<p class="orv_line">&quot;D-did you just say Jiyoon?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi asked, and Ye Hyunwoo frowned warily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Jiyoon! Do you know Jiyoon?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;She&#39;s my friend, why?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Where is Jiyoon now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo looked in my direction, startled by ahjussi&#39;s sudden outburst.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tried to calm ahjussi down as he breathed heavily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;His daughter&#39;s name is &#39;No Jiyoon&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo&#39;s eyes widened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No Jiyoon? Really?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">After looking back and forth between me and the ahjussi, Ye Hyunwoo muttered in a cautious</p>
<p class="orv_line">voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But it could be someone with the same name.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hyunwoo-ssi, is your friend the same Jiyoon who said she&#39;s going to marry Yoo Joonghyuk in</p>
<p class="orv_line">the future?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In response to my question, Ye Hyunwoo nodded with a dazed expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh? That&#39;s right. Wow, you really are Jiyoon&#39;s father. No, but if you&#39;re here means Omniscient</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reader.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Where is Jiyoon now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was his daughter&#39;s first acquaintance he met since crossing over to this world. Dansoo ahjussi</p>
<p class="orv_line">was almost out of breath.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m sorry....... I haven&#39;t met Jiyoon since I came here either.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But Jiyoon must be here somewhere too. I was dragged to the theater by her.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the mention of the theater, Kyung Sein asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you happen to be at &#39;Kim Dokja&#39;s Banquet&#39; as well?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. Were you too?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I was there too.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, most of the readers in the theater were transmigrated into this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even Dansoo ahjussi chimed in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I was in the hospital when I was suddenly brought in.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was possessed even though he was outside the theater. Then maybe it wasn&#39;t just the people</p>
<p class="orv_line">in the theater who came.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo sighed and added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If I had known this would happen, I wouldn&#39;t have gone. I was in a really good mood until I got</p>
<p class="orv_line">the quiz right. I was looking forward to the gift since I got the difficult quiz right.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What did you get right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, the meaning of 1,863.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, so that was the 7th Apostle.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I also vaguely remembered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The person who, in a confident voice, correlated Yoo Joonghyuk&#39;s regressions with the year the</p>
<p class="orv_line">first subway opened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe the girl sitting next to him was the one who asked if Kim Dokja was resurrected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, was the girl who asked about Kim Dokja Jiyoon?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo sighed as if it was a habit already and glanced in the direction of Yoo Joonghyuk,</p>
<p class="orv_line">who was still pacing the railroad tracks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I haven&#39;t seen Jiyoon since we got separated at that time. Of course I thought she&#39;d be by Yoo</p>
<p class="orv_line">Joonghyuk&#39;s side by now...... She doesn&#39;t seem to be possessing Jihye.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi&#39;s expression darkened sharply at the offhand remark.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Still, if it&#39;s Jiyoon, she&#39;s alive somewhere, so don&#39;t worry too much. There&#39;s no way such a tough</p>
<p class="orv_line">girl could be dead, and she&#39;s read the Book of Revelation more than I have.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I paused when I heard that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jiyoon had read it more than 50 times?</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if to change the subject, Ye Hyunwoo smiled slightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;By the way, it&#39;s amazing that you&#39;ve made it this far already. I&#39;ve read it 50 times, but I was</p>
<p class="orv_line">lucky enough to start near Chungmuro, but you guys.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We started at Geumho Station.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow, at &#39;Geumho Station&#39;? Well, since you&#39;re &#39;Cheon Inho&#39;...... So you met Jung Heewon there</p>
<p class="orv_line">too, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was talking to Lee Jihye a dozen steps away. Apparently, Lee Jihye took the</p>
<p class="orv_line">initiative to ask her questions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s really unusual. Jung Heewon becoming a colleague with Cheon Inho... Is this development</p>
<p class="orv_line">okay?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When he asked me that, I was speechless.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it was a novelty in terms of development.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Anyway, I&#39;m relieved to see other members of the Apostles. It was really hard to deal with</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King when he came with a bunch of kids from the Misreading Association.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard those words, I remembered the dead bodies of the outer species at the front</p>
<p class="orv_line">of the tunnel. Apparently, it was the work of Ye Hyunwoo and Gong Pildu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did the Misreading Association attack here as well?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;ve already met them, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thanks to Killer King.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Eh, that asshole...... Anyway, they came here as well. It seems like they prepared a lot for this</p>
<p class="orv_line">early rush. Of course, I think they definitely underestimated the third stage of my Invincible</p>
<p class="orv_line">Castellan tech tree.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo seemed to have a special attachment to Gong Pildu and talked to us about his Plan</p>
<p class="orv_line">to Raise an Invisible Castellan at Home for a while.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder how much he talked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I want to go home.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like I had been pricked by a thorn in the middle of the heart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know how long it had been, but Ye Hyunwoo had tears in his eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It belatedly dawned on me that Ye Hyunwoo was Jiyoon&#39;s age.</p>
<p class="orv_line">On the surface, everyone seemed excited to be in a novel, but there was no way anyone would</p>
<p class="orv_line">really want to be in an apocalypse like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein clenched her fists, and Dansoo ahjussi, who had stood up from his seat, reached over</p>
<p class="orv_line">the boy&#39;s shoulder as if to comfort him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that we heard a voice from behind him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Stop talking and come here, kid.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo rushed over and sat down next to Gong Pildu. Ye Hyunwoo whimpered, and Gong</p>
<p class="orv_line">Pildu glared at me like I was going to kill me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He&#39;s only in his mid-to-late teens. Such a child endured the first and second scenarios and</p>
<p class="orv_line">survived to this point.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to tell him anything. That he would make it home safely. That nothing would happen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But who am I to say that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsuchuchuchut.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Everyone&#39;s pockets vibrated with the same sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One by one, with a slight time difference, we pulled out our phones.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And then.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein&#39;s nervous voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She wasn&#39;t the only one. Dansoo ahjussi and even Ye Hyunwoo, who was next to Gong Pildu,</p>
<p class="orv_line">had similar faces.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The same message appeared on everyone&#39;s phone&#39;s screen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It&#39;s been a while. Dear readers.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja sent a message.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This, right nowᅳ&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly looked around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was to see if we were the only ones looking at our phones.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#39;s check it first.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened the message.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Hello, dear readers. By now, you&#39;re either on the second scenario or, if you&#39;re fast, already on</p>
<p class="orv_line">the third.</p>
<p class="orv_line">You&#39;ve all survived well. Of course, some of you haven&#39;t, but what can I do? You should&#39;ve read</p>
<p class="orv_line">it harder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The strange coolness in the way they speak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this really a message from the &#39;RepresentativeKimDokja&#39; I know?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all wondering. Why me? Did I do something wrong to be transmigrated into</p>
<p class="orv_line">this world? Was it because I read that damn novel? But I didn&#39;t even say anything bad about it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who the hell put me in this world and why?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I had an ominous premonition.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Everyone! If you haven&#39;t seen the message yet—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I didn&#39;t finish my sentence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I&#39;m sure you&#39;re frustrated. So, for those readers who have made it this far, I thought I&#39;d give a</p>
<p class="orv_line">little presentation on why you were brought to this world, and.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsuchuchuchut— I saw Kyung Sein, Dansoo ahjussi, and Ye Hyunwoo collapse one after</p>
<p class="orv_line">another like dolls with broken threads.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—What you must accomplish to return to your original world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My vision went black as well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—See you soon then.</p>

<br>
<p class="orv_line">A dark tunnel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The woman in the white coat, who had been watching Chungmuro Station with a lollipop in her</p>
<p class="orv_line">mouth, jumped up from her seat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey, remember all the guys whose phones just rang.&quot;</p>
[The constellation &#39;Sneaking Schemer&#39; asks what&#39;s wrong with them.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They&#39;re all possessed. Also.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The woman added, checking the faces of Cheon Inho and his party who fell down one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Track the coordinates of the newly created subspace. Find out where their souls have been</p>
<p class="orv_line">called. Quickly.&quot;</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">When I opened my eyes, I was lying in a large lobby. As I got up, I realized that my eye level</p>
<p class="orv_line">felt strangely familiar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Slowly, my eyes adjusted and took in the scene around me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The unlit ticket office and unmanned ticket machine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Chungmuro&#39;s theater.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I approached the ticket machine, I saw a face on the black screen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My face was in it. Not Cheon Inho&#39;s face, but Lee Hakhyun&#39;s face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I laughed out loud, and a sense of sadness crossed my mind. A deep sense of relief washed over</p>
<p class="orv_line">me, along with an unexplainable sense of regret.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it was all a dream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There&#39;s no such thing as transmigrating into a novel, after all. There&#39;s no way something like a</p>
<p class="orv_line">web novel could suddenly happen to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that the ceiling lit up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A dazzling pillar of light descended from the surroundings, and people began to be summoned</p>
<p class="orv_line">one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Uaaaah!&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some people screamed, while others looked around with calm faces.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They appeared in an instant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized who they were.</p>
「Readers.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The readers who had been transmigrated into the novel with me. It wasn&#39;t until I saw them that I</p>
<p class="orv_line">realized.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We had all been called here, just as we were in the real world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly counted the people. A number that seemed more than a hundred, even at a rough count.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, there were more possessed people from other places besides those in the theater.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had counted about a hundred and twenty of them when I spotted a head that stood out from the</p>
<p class="orv_line">crowd.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t recognize anyone else, but I recognized them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sein-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Eh? Who?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The surprised man turned his head toward me, and I saw his name tag.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man seemed to recognize my name tag as well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I-Inho-ssi? You must be Inho-ssi!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Uaaah! Inho-ssi!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein swooped down and gave me a big hug.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly pulled away from him and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you see the others?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know the others&#39; real faces.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well, that&#39;s true, too.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">As if they had realized what was happening, the sounds of people searching echoed around the</p>
<p class="orv_line">room.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Mijin-ah! Seo Mijin!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;JihyesLove-nim! Is JihyesLove-nim here?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;NamwoonsMom-nim!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, there was someone I needed to find too. Maybe this was my only chance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sein-ssi. I have to go somewhere for a while too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What? Inho-ssi! Wait!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pushed my way through the crowd, checking people&#39;s faces one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ji Eunyoo-ssi! Is Ji Eunyoo-ssi here?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyoo, my assignment editor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The one who brought me to this theater. She must have transmigrated here too, because she read</p>
<p class="orv_line">Omniscient Reader and answered the quiz correctly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ji Eunyoo-ssi!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was no sign of Ji Eunyoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Has she not been summoned yet?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Or........</p>
<p class="orv_line">I bit my lip hard. It wasn&#39;t anyone else, it was &#39;Ji Eunyoo&#39;. The one who had probably read my</p>
<p class="orv_line">novel more than me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There&#39;s no way Ji Eunyoo didn&#39;t survive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that I heard a familiar name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Jiyoon-ah...... Jiyoon-ah!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A neatly dressed middle-aged man was crouched on the ground, calling for someone desperately.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ahjussi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I approached, the middle-aged man looked up at me. It wasn&#39;t a face I remembered, but the</p>
<p class="orv_line">moment I saw those eyes, I was sure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho...... Mate?&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">It was the unmistakable Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The real-life Dansoo ahjussi was just as handsome as the novel version.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only difference was that this man looked so pale that it wouldn&#39;t be strange if he collapsed</p>
<p class="orv_line">immediately, and his body was built like a dry tree.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m sorry, mate, Jiyoon. Jiyoon, please.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi fainted on the spot leaving those words. His head was burning with fever. I</p>
<p class="orv_line">hastily carried him on my back. His body was as light as a child&#39;s.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked around nervously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Should I take him to the hospital?</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was no way I could get there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The theater&#39;s exits and elevators were blocked by translucent walls.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This wasn&#39;t the &#39;theater&#39; we knew, but a subspace someone temporarily created.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no way to escape.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was only one thing I could do now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Jiyoon-ah! No Jiyoon!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I started shouting at the top of my lungs to the surrounding area. Kyung Sein, who hurriedly</p>
<p class="orv_line">catched up, realized what was going on and shouted Jiyoon&#39;s name together with me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Jiyoon-ah, where are you!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Time and time again, I saw children who looked like Jiyoon&#39;s age, but I couldn&#39;t find Jiyoon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Soon, all the pillars of light disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The summoning was finally over.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The next moment, I stopped dead in my tracks, feeling a strange sense of heavy pressure. It was</p>
<p class="orv_line">hard to breathe, and my head felt dizzy.</p>
「Something is looking at us.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I lifted my head with difficulty, as if defying gravity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since when.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Someone was floating in the ceiling of the theater.</p>
【Let&#39;s see. You&#39;re all here at last.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Wearing a white coat that resembled Kim Dokja&#39;s and his trademark sunglasses, he was talking</p>
<p class="orv_line">to us.</p>
【Welcome to &#39;Kim Dokja&#39;s Banquet&#39;. Everyone.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The one who summoned us to this world.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Author&#39;s Note</p>
<p class="orv_line">The usual process of writing the author&#39;s note.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin: How about ㅇㅇㅇㅇㅇㅇ(brainstorming too much)?</p>
