<p class="orv_line">Throughout the rounds of &#x27;Ways of Survival&#x27;, Yoo Jonghyuk lost his memory several times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the edge of the 800th round, he met an outer deity belonging to the &#x27;Great Ancient One&#x27; and his spirit collapsed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Around the 1150th round, he was caught up in the giant nebula&#x27;s &#x27;regressor dissection plan&#x27; and became a test subject for the nebula for a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sometimes, like when &#x27;Mad Soldier Yoo Jonghyuk&#x27; was born through a wrong transfusion of Lee Hyunsung’s military stories, not only did he lose his memory, but his personality itself completely changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But has he ever become as small as he is now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">At least it doesn&#x27;t appear in the &#x27;Ways of Survival&#x27; that I remember. Of course, it appears once in &#x27;Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint&#x27;…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Watching Yoo Jonghyuk move his small hands to put on his battle boots, I had a really strange feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Should we really recognize that creature as Yoo Jonghyuk?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;The One Who Won the Rat&#x27; thinks the &#x27;little rat&#x27; is cute.]</div>[The constellation 'The One Who Won the Rat' thinks the 'little rat' is cute.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is there something going wrong in this world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You’re a really good runner.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">One by one, the incarnations who had completed acquiring their respective prizes gathered by my side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It was an amazing response. I never thought you would use stories in such a way... It would be nice if we could work in the same area at the center.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Which district will you choose? Why not join us?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m holding the &#x27;pig&#x27; side of the line. If you join me, I can connect you to that side too…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Same area. Apparently, the &#x27;Recycling Center&#x27; is divided into sections.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The lower level of the &#x27;Recycling Center&#x27; is the area of the nebula &#x27;Zodiac&#x27;.]</div>[The lower level of the 'Recycling Center' is the area of the nebula 'Zodiac'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Also.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[1st, 2nd, and 3rd places in the &#x27;Zodiac Race&#x27; will be given &#x27;zone priority selection&#x27;.]</div>[1st, 2nd, and 3rd places in the 'Zodiac Race' will be given 'zone priority selection'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I answered, asking for understanding from the gathered incarnations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m sorry, but I don’t have any plans to choose a specific faction yet.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, it would be nice to get on the line. But now was not the time to make that decision.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some of the incarnations looked disappointed at my answer, while others frowned and swore.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bicheonhori, who was watching the scene from the side, nodded his head. He didn&#x27;t show any signs of being angry or disappointed with my choice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Good. Choosing nothing is also a choice.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Nowadays, such choices have become commonplace.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bicheonhori must have thought what I said was interesting, so he took out a notebook and started writing down something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You said your name was &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27;, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, he was the person who wrote the famous book on characters, &quot;The 100 Strongest People&quot;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bicheonhori must have noticed my gaze and made an answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, because records are my hobby.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it okay?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What would happen if &#x27;Kim Dokja’ was listed as one the &#x27;Strongest 100 People&#x27;? I guess that means the future will be transformed too seriously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hmm. I guess this is what happens this time…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bicheonhori muttered something meaningful and smiled slightly as he looked at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I hope we get a chance to meet again, young man.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did something just change in his tone of voice?</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those last words, Bicheonhori chose his &#x27;zone&#x27; and disappeared into the recycling center.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a little disappointed, but I didn&#x27;t really care. Since we were destined to go to the same &#x27;Recycling Center&#x27; anyway, there would be another opportunity to talk, as he said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I checked the ‘zone selection message’ that appeared before my eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can select a total of 12 areas.]</div>[You can select a total of 12 areas.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Select an entry area.]</div>[Select an entry area.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">As previously explained, the &#x27;lower level&#x27; of the Recycling Center is the area of the nebula zodiac.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were twelve zones according to the tendencies of each zodiac sign, and incarnations could choose the zone they wanted.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Zone 1 - Ja-dong (자 동)]</div>[Zone 1 - Ja-dong (자 동)]</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[Zone 12 - Hae-dong (해 동)]</div>[Zone 12 - Hae-dong (해 동)]</p>
<p class="orv_line">From the rat that belongs to &#x27;Ja&#x27; to the pig that belongs to &#x27;hae&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I were  Dansu ahjussi or Sein-ssi, which one would I have chosen?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the results, little Yoo Jonghyuk was also staring at the options with serious eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Which one will you choose?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s none of your business.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course you would say this.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;The One Who Won the Rat&#x27; recommends Zone 2 – &#x27;Chuk-dong&#x27; to you.]</div>[The constellation 'The One Who Won the Rat' recommends Zone 2 – 'Chuk-dong' to you.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The One Who Won the Rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging by the modifier, that constellation was the constellation corresponding to &#x27;cow&#x27; in the zodiac.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Considering that I came in second place in the zodiac race and that one of the constellations that sponsored me in the beginning was the &#x27;original cow&#x27;, it wasn&#x27;t a bad idea to choose &#x27;Chuk-dong&#x27;, which corresponds to &#x27;cow&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;the dog that threw itself into the flames&#x27; pays attention to your choice.]</div>[The constellation 'the dog that threw itself into the flames' pays attention to your choice.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Zone 11, Sul-dong, represented by &#x27;dog&#x27;, was also worth considering. &#x27;The dog that threw itself into the flames&#x27; is the only constellation that took Kim Dokja’s side even in the main story. Maybe this is the time to build a relationship.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Nail-Eating Rat&#x27; pays attention to your choice.]</div>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' pays attention to your choice.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nail-Eating Rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Were you watching too?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I was conscious of the &#x27;Zodiac Race&#x27;, it was also a good idea to select Zone 1, where the winner of the story, the &#x27;Rat&#x27;, belongs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, on the &#x27;rat&#x27; and &#x27;snake&#x27; side, there are constellations of the Five Dogs Association.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you want to catch a tiger, you have to go into the tiger&#x27;s den. One way would be to choose their base...</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tiger.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, I had forgotten about the &#x27;Tiger Who Eats Rice Cake&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Considering my promise to him, Zone 3 &#x27;In-dong&#x27; was a good choice. The &#x27;Tiger Who Eats Rice Cake&#x27; has helped me and shown me favor at times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s strange that the indirect message of &#x27;Tiger Who Eats Rice Cake&#x27; is not heard at all, but...</p>
<p class="orv_line">In addition, I could also choose &#x27;Zone 5 - Jin-dong&#x27;, represented by the dragon, or &#x27;Zone 9- Shin-dong&#x27;, represented by the monkey.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[1 minute left to complete selection.]</div>[1 minute left to complete selection.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">My worries didn&#x27;t last long.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because now I am &#x27;Kim  Dokja&#x27;. And what Kim Dokja will say in the face of this choice is decided.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will not choose any district.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will not choose any district.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Ji Eunyu were next to me, she would have said, &quot;Writer, the lines here have been copied.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I didn&#x27;t say it twice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You there .&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Those words were just said by the little boy next to me, Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don’t copy me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shrugged my shoulders without answering.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Afterwards, indirect messages flew in one after another from thin air.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;the dog that threw itself into the flames&#x27; asks if you are sincere.]</div>[The constellation 'the dog that threw itself into the flames' asks if you are sincere.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;the pig in the brick house&#x27; respects your choice.]</div>[The constellation 'the pig in the brick house' respects your choice.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;nail-eating rat&#x27; feels sorry for you.]</div>[The constellation 'nail-eating rat' feels sorry for you.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Several people who confirmed my choice also voiced concerns.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you serious? This friend is out of his mind.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hehe, you didn’t choose the Chinese zodiac signs? That’s ridiculous—&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This decision cannot be undone.]</div>[This decision cannot be undone.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Do you want to keep this selection?]</div>[Do you want to keep this selection?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know it&#x27;s a risky choice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, if you choose a certain zodiac sign, you will eventually fall under the constellation to which that zodiac sign belongs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t want that situation. The &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; must have had the same thought.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;Heir to the Eternal Name&#x27; nods.]</div>[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' nods.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk and I nodded at the same time. Afterwards, a halo of light came down from the air and embraced us warmly.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You did not select any &#x27;zodiac sign&#x27;.]</div>[You did not select any 'zodiac sign'.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Hidden options are activated.]</div>[Hidden options are activated.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new achievement has been achieved.]</div>[A new achievement has been achieved.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Zone 13 – Move to &#x27;Heo-dong&#x27;.]</div>[Zone 13 – Move to 'Heo-dong'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Zone 13, huh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, there was an option not to choose a &#x27;zodiac sign&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What unfolded before my eyes along with the warp was a city with flashing neon signs. The buildings are somehow reminiscent of the Earth of the near future. The lights of a skyscraper flashing in the distance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how you look at it, it was a scene that was somewhat far from the world view of the &#x27;Zodiac&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is Zone 13?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Linked scenario activates!]</div>[Linked scenario activates!]</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Main Scenario #8 - Area 13&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Main</p>
<p>Difficulty:???</p>
<p>Clear conditions: ???</p>
<p>Time limit: —</p>
<p>compensation: ???</p>
<p>Failure: —</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">The title of the main scenario was also changed. However, key details such as clear conditions and rewards were still not revealed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We have to find out for ourselves.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Linked scenario activates!]</div>[Linked scenario activates!]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[An &#x27;event scenario&#x27; occurs every night in this area.]</div>[An 'event scenario' occurs every night in this area.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is an event scenario that occurs every night.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This feels a bit like déjà vu.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can obtain rewards when you survive the event scenario.]</div>[You can obtain rewards when you survive the event scenario.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I lightly scanned the street, I saw incarnations glancing at us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Most of them were beasts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A giraffe with one leg replaced by a machine. An elephant with broken tusks. A lion with all its fur removed and one eye missing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking closely, I saw that it wasn&#x27;t just the prisoners. Other races with animal origins, such as orcs and gnomes, were also seen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What they have in common is that they are also equipped with mechanical arms or mechanical legs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a worldview reminiscent of cyberpunk.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Tonight’s event is &#x27;The Three Little Pigs&#x27;.]</div>[Tonight’s event is 'The Three Little Pigs'.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Find an &#x27;accommodation&#x27; before the event starts and survive.]</div>[Find an 'accommodation' before the event starts and survive.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[One hour left until the event starts.]</div>[One hour left until the event starts.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, there was a good beginner&#x27;s guide.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One hour isn&#x27;t that much time. I need to hurry up a bit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced at little Yoo Jonghyuk and started walking away, leaving him behind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt someone following me a few steps away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After walking about twenty steps, I deliberately stopped. Then the sound of following footsteps disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I started walking again, the sound of hesitant footsteps followed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grinned and looked back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why are you following me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk, startled, froze in place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because I’m suspicious of you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was little Yoo Jonghyuk, who followed me eagerly, dragging his big boots.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the Demon King of Salvation had heard this, he would never have believed it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Tie your shoelaces properly.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s tied up.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The shoelaces were tied in a mess.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you know that there is a special option for those shoes?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Special options?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How much did you forget?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Would I have felt this way if I had a younger sibling?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I had a younger sibling, I thought it would be a good kid like Yoosoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I bowed lightly. Little Yoo Jonghyuk took a step back as if on guard, but my hands were faster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is how we tie it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Noble Man&#x27;s Battle Boots&#x27; activates special options when the shoelaces are tightened and tied in a specific way.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The special option of the item &#x27;Battle Boots of the Noble One&#x27; is activated!]</div>[The special option of the item 'Battle Boots of the Noble One' is activated!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The basics of Yoo Jonghyuk, these battle boots had &#x27;solid durability&#x27; and &#x27;resistance to various properties&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In addition, as an auxiliary option, &#x27;phenomenal elasticity&#x27; can be activated, and the size can be adjusted comprehensively to the extent that it can handle Yoo Jonghyuk, who activated &#x27;Geoshinhwa&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The size of the item changes to suit the wearer!]</div>[The size of the item changes to suit the wearer!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk asked, looking down at the battle boots that had been tightened to fit his feet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You, how do you know this?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you surprised that I know how to tie my shoelaces?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I want to ask you how you don’t know any of this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is my name &#x27;Yoo Jonghyuk&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quietly looked into the eyes of little Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to my guess, the reason why Yoo Jonghyuk lost his memory was due to the side effects of &#x27;Story Imprint&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don’t know, but it’s probably because of &#x27;restraint of truth&#x27; or &#x27;restraint of emotions&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even looking back, it was strange that Yoo Jonghyuk&#x27;s combat power, when he became the &#x27;Black Beast&#x27;, did not suffer the aftereffects of probability.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. You are a dirt eater.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t eat dirt.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Once you try it, you might change your mind.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you want to die?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you kill me, you will never know who you are.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk thought about something for a moment, then frowned and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What is your name?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It is Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That’s a strange name.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m sick of hearing things like that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though we didn&#x27;t really talk, I somehow felt nostalgic.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What else do you know about me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Before that, what do you remember?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ten days.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ten days?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;After ten days, most of my memories will return.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ten days. That&#x27;s enough time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And that we have to find the stolen equipment.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;When was the equipment taken away?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t know. It was like this when I woke up.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I think he lost it while climbing up the &#x27;Star Ladder&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Considering that battle boots were released as a product from the &#x27;Recycling Center&#x27;, key items such as &#x27;Infinite Dimension Subspace Coat&#x27; and &#x27;Wolgeuk&#x27; could have been in a similar situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if nothing else was known, &#x27;Wolgeuk&#x27; had to be recovered. That&#x27;s Yoo Jonghyuk&#x27;s key weapon in the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I have to meet a guy named Cheon Inho.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I paused for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why him?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t know. I just remember that I have to meet that bastard. When I meet that bastard—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quietly grabbed the dirt from the floor. If this little guy remembered anything, I was going to throw dirt in his mouth and Run away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I thought I could last at least ten days before I recovered my memory.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was dazed for a moment and then looked down at the dirt in my hands. When I opened my tightly clenched fist, dirt flowed down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt fortunate that I was still wearing the mask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will accompany you for about ten days. I will help you not die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you planning?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said, holding out my right hand covered in dirt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There are conditions.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk nodded as if he knew that would happen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Say it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You can’t kill me after ten days.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk looked up at me with an expression that he didn&#x27;t know what that meant, and he held out his clean right hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t kill people for no reason.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, of course you won’t.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Our &#x27;survival contract&#x27; was concluded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And an hour later, little Yoo Jonghyuk spoke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will definitely kill you, Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
