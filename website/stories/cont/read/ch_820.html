<p class="orv_line">Her eyes widened as she found me sitting in the seat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her blond hair swayed in the wind. Her eyes shook as if she was agitated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I waved my hand lightly at her and smiled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s been a while.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I never thought we would meet in a place like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her expression hardened at my greeting, and she hesitated for a moment before approaching me briskly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheon Inho.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The person who called me &#39;Cheon Inho&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why are you here?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Prophet Anna Croft.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was in the same &#39;terror&#39; as me.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As I live, there will come a day when I ride the same subway as Anna Croft.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought about my last encounter with her. The last time I saw her was at the &#39;Washington Dome&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that time, I fell into &#39;Gingagap&#39;, a trap set by &lt;Asgard&gt;, and there, I borrowed the power of the Demon King of Salvation and defeated the great constellations. Come to think of it, I owed Anna Croft that time. If she hadn’t processed the &#39;lower dragon heart&#39; with her own trait, neither I nor the Demon King of Salvation would have been able to summon the power of &#39;Cheok Junkyung&#39; as a [bookmark].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that I think about it, Cheok Junkyung is here too. I don’t know if it was a coincidence or not, but things were going quite strangely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pointed to the seat next to me and said to Anna Croft.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Please sit down.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft hesitated for a moment, as if she was uncomfortable sitting next to me, and then sat down with a helpless expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you planning here?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m not planning anything in particular.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you planning—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment we got to that point in the conversation, I felt the gaze I had felt the other time.</p>
「On the sub way」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Oh, again.</p>
「You’re tal king too loud ly」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My stomach started to churn and I felt faint dizziness.</p>
[Exclusive skill &#39;Fourth Wall&#39; is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, I had already experienced it once, and the [Fourth Wall] was also activated, so I could endure it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it seemed that Anna Croft was not like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;W-what is this?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, whose face had turned pale, was already sweating profusely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even she, who had a fairly high level of mental barrier, could end up like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Lower your voice.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I whispered, the gazes around her disappeared as if they had been washed away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, panting and wiping away her sweat, asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What was that just now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Probably a fear effect.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The subway we were riding in had not yet experienced the &#39;Crime Zone&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging from the fact that a similar phenomenon occurred when I called and when I spoke to Anna Croft—this place seemed to be a space dominated by the common &#39;Yeong-ui-byeong-jeol&#39; of public transportation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It could be something like this. Do not talk loudly or make noise. Do not eat food.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Do not make noise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Give up your seat to pregnant women or the elderly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft also seemed to have noticed the rules.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;A peculiar rule is in effect.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s an ordinary rule. This was normal before the scenarios came.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We sat side by side and admired the everyday scenery that we had forgotten. The soft breathing of people. People looking down and concentrating on the small screen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It felt real again. This was the ordinary world we knew. People in those days were trapped in their own worlds, and perhaps the scenario pulled them out of there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Scenarios&#39; that Kim Dokja had read.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced over and saw that Anna Croft was also lost in a short reflection.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She must have sensed my gaze, but she came to her senses and said in a cold voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I knew you were alive, but you&#39;re much better than I thought.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft seemed to have already heard the news about me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re glad I&#39;m okay, aren&#39;t you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No one can go through something like that and be fine.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Have you heard any rumors?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I heard that you were chased by giant nebulae and torn apart.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Torn apart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s not wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was not the one who was &#39;torn apart&#39; to begin with.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow, it almost turned out like that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re so tenacious that you survived that kind of defeat.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because I&#39;m good at coming back from the dead. But why did you come here?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you really asking because you don&#39;t know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A thought occurred to me belatedly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The last time I saw Anna Croft, she went against her own Nebula, &lt;Asgard&gt;, to help me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew what the incarnation that went against the nebulae would say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You seem to be blooming too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thanks to who? I was going to ask you about it at the recycling center anyway...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Um, I didn&#39;t see you there?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I didn&#39;t know you were a crazy person who wanted to clear it all the way.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you come all the way to the Terror Spirit to chase me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Look here. Do I look like someone who&#39;s free?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then why did you come to the Terror Spirit?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m not the incarnation of &lt;Asgard&gt; anymore. What choice would an abandoned incarnation have?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aha, you&#39;re thinking of becoming a Transcendent.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only path left for her abandoned by &lt;Asgard&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft had come here to climb the only ladder of social mobility that a mortal abandoned by the constellations could attempt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think that&#39;s also a failure since I came all the way here to meet you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Come on, let&#39;s forget about the old days and get along. That&#39;s how we&#39;ll get out of here. We&#39;ll go out and become Transcendents, and take revenge on the constellations . Anyway, let&#39;s go on good terms.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft muttered as if she was shocked at what I said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;On good terms? Do you think that&#39;s possible between you and me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;ve become a colleague with Yoo Jonghyuk. I&#39;ll embrace you with a big heart.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who&#39;s talking to whom right now—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, who was about to shout, suddenly stopped talking. The passengers&#39; eyes were turned towards her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft asked again, sighing as if she was going to collapse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheon Inho. Do you know anything about this &#39;horror&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded and briefly relayed the information I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft nodded after hearing my story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I expected it since the background was the subway. Then I guess we&#39;ll have to create a dangerous zone to get out of here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m against it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Against it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We have to find a way to get out without activating the dangerous zone.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Didn&#39;t you say that the method is unknown? With your abilities, you could easily be the last one standing even if you use the &#39;danger zone&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You were on board with me, of all people.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft looked momentarily flustered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because of me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The Cheon Inho of this world line is quite affectionate.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You always said that and aimed for my back.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheok Junkyung is riding in the next car.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheok… Junkyung?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you know the Goryeo Swordsman?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, no way—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did Anna Croft&#39;s face turn pale as if she realized the situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We&#39;re dead.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s why I need your ability now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, it was my good fortune to meet Anna Croft now. Anna Croft was the incarnation with the ability specialized in this &#39;terror spirit&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Can you see something in [Future Sight]?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft can read the future with [Future Vision]. This means that if she uses her ability well, she can also power up the threatening fear that will come in the future.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Anna Croft&#39;s expression was unusual.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;My [Future Sight] lost its power after coming here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft glared at me for a moment as if she didn&#39;t want to admit it, then added,</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s as if the entire future is covered in fog.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was unexpected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She can&#39;t see the future. Why?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking back, there were several times in the main story when &#39;Anna Croft&#39;s&#39; prophetic ability was blocked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why was that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Oh... Wait a minute. Could it be?</p>
<p class="orv_line">A hypothesis suddenly came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To verify that hypothesis, I reviewed Han Sooyoung&#39;s guide once again. But why?</p>
[Some spoilers in this document have been removed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Some sentences that were previously marked as &#39;spoilers&#39; have been released.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>A common experience was observed in all passengers who survived without using the &#39;crime zone&#39; in the subway.</p>
<p>All passengers who successfully escaped stated that 「the subway lights blinked three times」.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">The subway lights blinked three times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was an incredibly crucial hint. So, what I have to do is make the subway lights blink three times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Should I cause a power outage?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheon Inho.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is that how you see it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft tilted her head slightly, so I hurriedly hid my phone and answered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I just read some web novels.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Novels? You&#39;re reading novels in this situation? Are you crazy?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft glared at me like she was looking at a bug, then made a resigned expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I used to read a lot of novels, too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, my vision went black for a moment and then came back. My mind was blank.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What? What just happened?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft also looked surprised. She hurriedly looked around and muttered quietly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is it a power outage?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">My mind felt brighter at the word power outage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Anna Croft. Please continue what you were just saying.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you talking about? A power outage?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, you were talking about novels.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What’s the big deal about that right now—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Listen to me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft nodded her head slightly at my serious tone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But what else do I have to say…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hmm.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized that this person is also quite inexperienced at having conversations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, she is a &#39;prophet&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A being who can read the past and the future. In a sense, she is a character as &#39;omniscient&#39; as Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Would a prophet who knows all of someone’s shortcomings and secrets before they even become close to her really make an effort to build deep relationships with others?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps all humans would look like characters with past and future plots in front of her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thinking about it that way, I could finally understand Anna Croft’s attitude toward her colleagues.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, I am a more social person than Kim Dokja or Anna Croft.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you have a favorite author?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft nodded belatedly and answered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There is.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who is it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ted Chang, Charles Yu, Liu Cixin. And…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled, feeling like I expected it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well, Anna wouldn&#39;t read web novels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft let out a snarl, interpreting my smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you making fun of my reading tastes?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, I just laughed because I thought it suited you well.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who do you like?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;My favorite author.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I muttered, looking at the letters shining on the screen of my smartphone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s someone named Han Sooyoung.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft muttered, &quot;Han Sooyoung,&quot; and tilted her head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;ve never heard of that author before. Is she a famous author in Korea?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;In some worldline.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft tilted her head for a moment, as if imagining a worldline where Han Sooyoung is famous.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the meantime, I was staring at the ceiling light. The light was flickering, emitting an uncertain light that seemed to be fading.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was almost like a blink, which was a pity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this not enough?</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that case, I had no choice but to resort to a desperate measure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Anna Croft, what role will I assign you from now on?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You are Korean from now on and your name is Kim Anna.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ms. Kim Anna. Do you speak Spanish?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Anna looked at me with her typical bewildered expression, then answered as if she had no choice but to follow along.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know a little bit.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Puede prestarme dinero.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Anna asked back with a dumbfounded expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why are you suddenly asking me to lend you money?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you have any apps you can recommend for me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Apps?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Like apps to learn Spanish.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheon Inho. What the hell are you talking about?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho has an Inho&#39;s life.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And Anna has an Anna&#39;s life.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, the lights flickered again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a surge of joy inside.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, my guess was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft asked back in a bewildered voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What did you do just now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Be quiet.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was clear now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I muttered as I looked back at the passengers. I don’t know if it was one of them or someone outside this space.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We’re being &#39;audited&#39; right now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone was watching us here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you remember what the first scenario was?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first scenario was about &#39;killing a living being&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The name of the scenario was &#39;Proof of Worth&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Proof of Worth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Every incarnation had to prove their &#39;worth&#39; to &#39;someone&#39; through the first scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna, who had been looking around, asked with a hardened expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No way. The constellations are watching?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Not constellations.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t know. I think we have to make them happy to get out.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The lights had blinked twice so far. And both of those blinks happened when I parodied the development of the &#39;main story&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But now there was no more main story content to parody. The situation where even the &#39;Reader&#39;s Life&#39;, which was a desperate measure, was used. In terms of the main story development, this was the &#39;beginning of the scenario&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It means that the &#39;Crime Zone&#39; must open.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then the &#39;Crime Zone&#39; is...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It would have been the easiest way to entertain someone.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, I had a vague idea of ​​who that &#39;someone&#39; was.</p>
「At least this horror is related to Kim 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Dokja.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the first place, the only people who would enjoy watching the parody of the main story would be Kim Dokja or Kim Dokja&#39;s acquaintances.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, the way to make the subway lights blink is simple.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All I had to do was start a story that would make even that &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; curious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Anna Croft.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, I was with someone who knew one of those stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I want to know exactly what happened in the last 40th round.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was also something I was curious about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft asked, lightly puffing out one cheek and then bursting it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheon Inho. What are you up to? I&#39;d rather ask you about the last round.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t know much because I lost my memories of that round. What happened? What did I do? Why do you and Yoo Jonghyuk hate me so much.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A story I should have found out a long time ago, but kept putting off.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t know anything. That&#39;s why I want to know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Taking a deep breath, an old memory suddenly came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The red coat. The wings of the Demon King, the being called &#39;the evil sophist&#39; by the constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The two blades that crossed to kill each other.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps it was a question I should have asked a long time ago. In order to meet the second Kim Dokja, to become a proper comrade with Yoo Jonghyuk, in order to resolve this &#39;fear&#39;, I—</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who on earth is &#39;Cheon Inho&#39; from the 40th round?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I need to know exactly who I am first.</p>
