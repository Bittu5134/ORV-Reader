            <div class="orv_title"><h1>685 Episode 22 Name (7)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Departure is in one hour. When you are ready, come to the throne room in Gwanghwamun."</p>
<p class="orv_line">After completing the one-sided notification, Yoo Jonghyuk sat cross-legged again and closed his eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately left Yoo Jonghyuk and headed to the Gwanghwamun tent village where people were gathered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While moving, I had a brief chat with Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That’s an interesting ability. You mean you can only read the comments and not the text?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Yes.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja, the 'Demon King of Salvation' who shared my vision, was busy looking at the platform app linked to his smartphone.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>…</p>
<p>Episode 22. Name (3) +[8]</p>
<p>Episode 22. Name (2) +[11]</p>
<p>Episode 22. Name (1) +[14]</p>
<p>…</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">It appears that the app can be shared on the smartphone received as a relic.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just by looking briefly, Kim Dokja seemed to realize what the situation was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Your story is being serialized here in real time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I think so.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you think about it, Kim Dokja also experienced something similar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that time, it was not a spin-off, but a revised version of Ways of Survival.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—There was quite a long break from the series between episodes 21 and 22.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The break period between episodes 21 and 22 is exactly 45 days.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'It’s the same amount of time I was unconscious.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">That means that this 'serialization' is recorded only when I am awake.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Who is serializing it?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">The original author of 'Ways of Survival' and 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' was Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So, is it her who is writing this series?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, Han Sooyoung died right before my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But... there's no way she really died. The Han Sooyoung I know would definitely survived that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—How do I know that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'You can observe the whole universe.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That's what the Oldest Dream does.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I think about it, his current identity was the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had a strange feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What was his constellation level?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'What grade are you: great grade, narrative grade, or mythical grade?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the original work, Kim Dokja's final grade was 'myth level'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, according to Kim Dokja, the Demon King of Salvation, the Kim Dokja I know was divided around 'modifiers'. That means...</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Let’s read the comments first. Try a free ticket.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the way he was changing the subject, I guess he wasn’t a mythical grade.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[One free daily pass will be deducted.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, the suggestion to read the comments itself wasn't bad. Because I needed as much information as possible right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I clicked on the comments for the most recent episode.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Regardless of the order, one comment from that episode will be revealed at random.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">—The Demon King of Salvation! The Demon King of Salvation! The Demon King of Salvation!</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>I saved the person who wrote the comment as a fan of the 'Demon King of Salvation' and checked the next comment.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">—Zeus, Poseidon, Jecheon Daeseong, and... the Demon King of salvation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is he also a fan of the ' Demon King of Salvation'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt Kim Dokja grinning in my head and wondered what was so funny.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately checked the third comment.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>—That is not the Demon King of Salvation I knew...</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">"Finally a normal comment."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know who wrote the comment, but he is truly a wise friend.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought I had finally hit Kim Dokja, but unexpectedly, his reaction was calm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—What. Because each person’s idea of 'me' will be different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'You admit it easily?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Me too, my impression of Yoo Jonghyuk was different when I first saw him and when I saw him later.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Are you talking about Yoo Jonghyuk again?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Jonghyuk is soft now, but there are times in the second half where he really seems like a psychopath. Especially when his coins decrease, that child becomes very sensitive...</p>
<p class="orv_line">Certainly, this 'Demon King of Salvation' was cynical.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He looked a lot like Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An office worker who was afraid to even buy a lunch box from a convenience store. A man who lived a simple life of happiness, whose daily pleasure was to get off work early and read Ways of Survival.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Still, Jonghyuk is somewhat loyal. From what I've seen, it doesn't seem like there was anything wrong with the 41st round...</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was saved by the story of 'Yoo Jonghyuk' and loved 'Ways of Survival' more than anyone else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A person who was often selfish and sometimes played mischievous pranks, but still had a shred of warmth towards humans.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—If you take advantage of that and roll well in the 41st round, no matter how bad your situation is…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja does not have a great sense of justice, but he protects those close to him at all costs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Are you listening to me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Yes. 'I’ll look at the last comment.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">I used my last free pass.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>—He’s in danger of dying again. At this point, I feel pity. Well, his constellation is also the Demon King of Salvation...</p>
<p></p>
<p>We were silent at the same time. This was because it was very clear who was in danger of dying.</p>
<p>'What is it? This.'</p>
<p>—Hmm.</p>
<p>Is it related to the seventh scenario?</p>
<p>Yoo Jonghyuk said: 'The end of the 'seventh scenario' will be with Anna Croft.'</p>
<p>That means the final chapter of this scenario is 'Peace Land'.</p>
<p>It means that it will be a kind of national cooperative war...</p>
<p>What happened there?</p>
<p>Kim Dokja, who was thinking deeply about something, asked.</p>
<p>—How much of a difference is there between this point of view and our point of view now?</p>
<p>'It will be almost the same. I think the latest version depicts the near future a little ahead of time.'</p>
<p>—It has the same effect as Anna Croft’s short-term future vision. Since you have to guess from the comments, the accuracy of the analysis is somewhat low.</p>
<p>'Yes. Well, that's right.'</p>
<p>—What is the speed of development per episode?</p>
<p>'It's not that fast in my opinion.'</p>
<p>—Then it may not be a crisis related to the scenario.</p>
<p>That is correct.</p>
<p>So what is this crisis?</p>
<p>First of all, I think I avoided being beaten to death by Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p>—Have you felt anything strange since you woke up?</p>
<p>My sponsor seemed to have something to do with it.</p>
<p>'Is there something strange?'</p>
<p>—Suddenly, I thought 'that' would start.</p>
<p>'…Can you please stop using ominous expressions? You just have to tell me exactly.'</p>
<p>—I thought so too when I was an incarnation, but if I say it this way, the probability cost is low.</p>
<p>'Does talking also cost money with Midday Tryst?'</p>
<p>—Do you think it’s easy for a constellation to convey information? I think by now you...</p>
<p>'Yes?'</p>
<p>A swooshing sound was heard in Kim Dokja's voice, as if there were noise, and then a light spark flew out of the smartphone.</p>
<p><!>['Midday Tryst' was interrupted due to a temporary error.]</p>
<p>I immediately checked my smartphone. I thought the relic was defective, but it didn't seem that way.</p>
<p>"Hello?"</p>
<p>Kim Dokja said nothing. No indirect message was heard.  </p>
<p>Has he suddenly been hit with a probability aftermath?</p>
<p>That may be so.</p>
<p>Even if the 'Demon King of Salvation' is not a mythical grade constellation, it’s still a constellation.</p>
<p>Worst of all, why would we waste all the probability just by calling their names and refer to them with modifiers?</p>
<p>However, I had a real-time chat with a constellation.</p>
<p>Even if the relic shared the probability, it would certainly not have been an easy task for Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>Anyway, things got awkward.</p>
<p>It seemed like he was trying to say something important at the end...</p>
<p>While I was thinking about this and that, I entered the tent village.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi?"</p>
<p>There was a girl waiting for me at the entrance.</p>
<p>"Ah."</p>
<p>It was Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I remember the last time I met Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, whom I met in the solo dungeon 'Nagak’s Field' and explored the Star Jewel Dungeon together.</p>
<p><&>「"If you say one word, I will kill them all."」</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung at that time was definitely not the Shin Yoosoung of the 41st round.</p>
<p>"It’s been a while. How have you been?"</p>
<p>"Fine!"</p>
<p>I looked at Shin Yoosoung, who was shouting brightly, and stared at her secretly. A unique white and bright face. I could tell with just a quick look.</p>
<p>It doesn't feel the same as before.</p>
<p>Just looking at each other made me feel cold.</p>
<p>The golden glow is no longer detectable.</p>
<p>So, is Shin Yoosoung’s possession now over?</p>
<p>If it's over, why?</p>
<p>An ominous thought rushed into my mind.</p>
<p>Maybe something bad had happened to &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt;. </p>
<p>"Do you remember what happened in the Star Jewel Dungeon?"</p>
<p>I didn't ask with high hope.</p>
<p>However, I was curious about this child's condition.</p>
<p>If this child was possessed by Shin Yoosoung of the 1,864th round, what state was this child in during the possession?</p>
<p>"Of course. I remember everything."</p>
<p>She remembers?</p>
<p>"Do you also remember taming the ancient Nagak?"</p>
<p>"Of course! But…"</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, who paused for a moment, continued.</p>
<p>"That wasn’t me."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>“No, it was me... I guess I should say it was a slightly different me..."</p>
<p>My heart was beating slowly.</p>
<p>She has memories of being in a state of possession.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung hesitated for a while and explained, as if she had trouble expressing  it.</p>
<p>"Well, do you know a skill called [Taming]?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"If I had to express it, ... it feels like this. It seems strange that I, from another world, must have tamed me and moved on, doesn’t it?"</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, who was twisting her hair with her fingers, glanced at me and lowered her head.</p>
<p>I said, holding the child's small shoulder.</p>
<p>"No. It’s not strange at all."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I believe you, Miss Yoosoung."</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung’s eyes shone brightly. Her eyes were not as golden as when the 41st round Shin Yoosoung possessed her, but in some ways, her eyes were clearer than before.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, who was faintly embarrassed, opened her mouth again.</p>
<p>"Ah, I thought you might believe me. My other self also said that."</p>
<p>"What did she say?"</p>
<p>"I can trust you, ahjussi."</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>"And now she said she won’t be able to come for a while. So she said I should take good care of you…"</p>
<p>I don't know why Shin Yoosoung's possession ended. However, she was worried about me until the last moment when the possession was lifted.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung looked up at me andasked cautiously.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi? Are you okay?"</p>
<p>"It's okay."</p>
<p>She hurriedly lifted her head and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung asked in an innocent voice.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi, but can I ask you one question?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Just ask."</p>
<p>"Who is Kim Dokja?"</p>
<p>Where did this child hear that name?</p>
<p>"Kim Dokja…"</p>
<p>The name rang in my ears and my head became dizzy.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi?"</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung hurriedly caught me as I stumbled.</p>
<p>What is it? Somehow my limbs felt weak.</p>
<p>"Ah, ahjussi! Blood…!"</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, who hurriedly called me, pointed to my neck. I unconsciously brought my hand to my neck.</p>
<p>When did it happen?</p>
<p>Blood was flowing from a minor wound on my neck.</p>
<p>When I looked closely, I saw that it wasn't blood. The blood on my fingers was breaking into pieces.</p>
<p>A story?</p>
<p>"Get away!"</p>
<p>As soon as I reflexively pushed Shin Yoosoung away, sparks started flying from my whole body.</p>
<p><!>[The &lt;Star Stream&gt; has determined the grade of the story that will be given to you.]</p>
<p>Kim Dokja’s words came to mind.</p>
<p>Advice that 'my crisis may not be a scenario'.</p>
<p><&>「I was in a 'scenario departure area', when I was weak, I killed the 'God of the Other World' with the 'Demon King of Salvation'.」</p>
<p>45 days ago, the accomplishments I had achieved were truly unbelievable.</p>
<p>And now, that achievement was coming back to me as a story.</p>
<p>However, not all 'stories' always bring only beneficial effects to their owners.</p>
<p><!>[A new story related to you is born!]</p>
<p><!>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' was born!]</p>
<p>Heir of the Eternal Name.</p>
<p>That was the name of my new story.</p>
<p><!>[The temporary grade of this story is 'semi-mythical level'.]</p>
<p><!>[The grade of this story may be reevaluated in the future.]</p>
<p><!>[Your current level cannot handle this story.]</p>
<p>One day, on the 'Island of Reincarnation', Yoo Hoseong, the invincible warrior, said something like that.</p>
<p>Those who cannot control the story will eventually be eaten by the story.</p>
<p>For a moment, I remembered what 49% Kim Dokja was like.</p>
<p>He is an [Avatar] Kim Dokja with 49% of his memory.</p>
<p>51% left paving stones for the happiness of his companions.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, no way.</p>
<p>In the 1,864th round, 49% Kim Dokja suffers from a disease that gradually causes his stories to collapse.</p>
<p><!>[Your physical condition is extremely unstable.]</p>
<p><!>[The durability of the body decreases rapidly!]</p>
<p>This was the price I paid for declaring that I would become 'Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p><!>[Currently, you are an imperfect Kim Dokja.]</p>
<p><!>[You must acquire additional Kim Dokja Fragments to survive.]</p>
<p>I saw my companions running after spotting me from afar. Dansu ahjussi, Kyung Sein, and even Killer King.</p>
<p>But I couldn't welcome them.</p>
<p><!>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal name’ is craving it.]</p>
<p>The story inside me was commanding me.</p>
<p><!>[If you do not acquire a new 'Kim Dokja Fragment' within 50 minutes, you will die.]</p>
<p>To become the one and only Kim Dokja. To destroy all other Kim Dokjas.</p>
<p><!>[Time left until death: 49:51]</p>
