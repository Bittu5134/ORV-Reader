        <article class="orv_main">
            <div class="orv_title"><h1>656 Episode 19 People of the Past (8)</h1></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The silent blade moved, and no one could see it. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The extremely compressed sense of time slowly returned, and a light spark flew from the right hand holding the sword.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation that has not yet revealed their modifier is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't hear the screams of the incarnations or the sound of weapons clashing anymore.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All the signs that were running towards me also disappeared.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' opens his mouth.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' says, that the incarnation Cheon Inho is actually hiding his power, and his eyes light up.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' feels deep sadness from your sword.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">While the sound of something falling on the floor echoed one after another, no one shared the same eye level as me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Probably like Yoo Jonghyuk always did.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is amazed at your martial arts.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'First sword of Goryeo'...]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A handful of constellations sponsored 1,000 coins for your action.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A sense of limitless omnipotence and superiority dwelling in the body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I felt someone in the distant sky watching me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation wrapped in a veil slows down.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When I suddenly raised my head at the unfamiliar hostility, my eyes disappeared somewhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A tingling feeling of fatigue.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I have already experienced the side effects of [Incite] through [Sentence Reinforcement].</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I procrastinate here any longer, I'll be eaten up by [Incite] like last time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsut.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Incite' is canceled.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A terrifying recoil rushed through my body. Blood trickled down from my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a really grueling experience. It's just the weight of Yoo Jonghyuk in the very beginning, and that's a momentary [incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it was, is it this much?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even after the skill was unlocked, I felt something like Yoo Jonghyuk’s remnant in my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a joke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I lightly wiped my lips with one hand and looked down at the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uh. Aaaaaaaa!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A scream that rang out a beat late.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Taesung was lucky. The legs of the guy were rolling on the floor. Stopping the pouring blood, he was looking up at me with red eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The emotion in his eyes quickly turned to fear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Taesung, perhaps forgetting the pain, began to servilely pray.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Save me! Save me!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I approached the guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at his terrified face reminded me of Dansu ahjussi’s face. Dansu ahjussi, who had blank eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Taesung was full of wounds, and a man who lost his mind was looking for his daughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's all because of Dansu ahjussi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">They made Dansu ahjussi that way. They ruined the life of an innocent ahjussi who was searching for his daughter in this world.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 They must be killed. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The remnants of Yoo Jonghyuk inside of me were saying that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ho, are you by any chance a reader?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Taesung suddenly lifted his head and said while holding onto my trousers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Save me. Please, please save me! We're from the same world."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I saw the trembling face looking up at me, I realized who this man was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This man is not 'old-fashioned'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am also a person who has read 'The Book of Revelation'. I really enjoyed it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's all a misunderstanding... It's a misunderstanding! I'm different from the others! I didn't read all of them illegally, and I paid for a lot of them!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Like a condemned prisoner confessing his sins for the last time before he dies, he continued to talk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I want to live. I want to live. Please. I want to go back home. I didn't want to come to a place like this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As he said that, he shed tears as if he was overwhelmed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uh, I miss Mom and Dad. Fuck. I didn't want to do this either. Just, just to survive somehow..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">How old was this man?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Where did he live and what did he do?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I do not know. Then and now, this man was a complete stranger to me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 So maybe, this is the last chance to kill this man. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I make up my mind and fixed 'Broken Faith' again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will do it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung passed me by and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I have to practice too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Practice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"To survive."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung's voice was low when she said that. I couldn't see the child's expression, but I could see why.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung's eyes would be golden now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You don't want to do that, ahjussi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it small? Shin Yoosoung's small back as she spat those words made me feel the years I did not know. She must have been a child who had only lived for ten years.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grabbed Shin Yoosoung's shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll do it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the meantime, Gu Taesung dragged his butt and retreated to the edge. But he had nowhere to run.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Relocate' will begin in 1 minute.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If he gets out of this 'safe area' anyway, he will be burned to death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Taesung, perhaps realizing his situation, began to pray again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Please help me. I really didn’t want to do this either. They said that if I just performed my role well, I would be sent home."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The one possessed by Gu Taesung was a member of the 'Misreading association'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I don't know how the 'Misreading association' came to this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were not readers who purchased and read the entire book, nor were they participants in 'Kim Dokja's Banquet'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, how did they possess this world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Taesung swallowed his breath at the sharpness of the blade pressing down on his throat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who brought you here?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That, that's…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Taesung opened his mouth again, as if he had made up his mind on something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dok—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsutsutsutsu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, his whole body jumped up like an electrocuted fish. The boy's lips were on fire.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something was controlling the guy's right to speak.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Relocate' will begin in 30 seconds.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Taesung, who twisted his body as if in pain, managed to part his lips.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm sorry. I can't tell you that. I'll do anything else instead. Anything I can—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at such a man, and the remnants of the Yoo Jonghyuk that remained in my head did not speak to me anymore. Maybe it was because my heart was a little weak, but what came to my mind instead was the memory of Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "No matter how much it is in a novel, I don't want to kill anyone." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After the scenarios started, ahjussi hadn't killed anyone until now. Even now, when he lost his reason and became a monster, he kept repeating the words "I won't kill you".</p>
<p class="orv_line">Obviously, the fragment of Kim Dokja inside ahjussi must be the best and purest piece of Kim Dokja.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Because it's a novel that my daughter liked." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly lowered the sword that I was raising.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[After 20 seconds, 'Rearrangement' will begin.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Taesung's complexion brightened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you! Thank you!" Gu Taesung shed tears of relief and put his hand on his chest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I-I don't have much, but even this-"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I tried to say I didn't need it, I felt my bones soften.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something was approaching at great speed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung caught me as if she felt something strange, and I also covered Shin Yoosoung as if to protect her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The magic wave that flew in with a squeaking sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I reflexively grasped 'Broken Faith'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Broken Faith's durability has run out.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In an instant, I realized something.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 This is not an attack aimed at us. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The magic wave passed me and Shin Yoosoung, and blew Gu Taesung's neck.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a tragedy that took place without a chance to stop it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The magic, that came into the safe area in an instant, turned Gu Taesung's hair into a green circle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s still backing down." A familiar voice said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A man in a black coat was there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Quite a handsome face for an extra.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A unique way of speaking that imitates Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The king of kings doesn't act that way. What's the point of worrying about killing the wicked?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw a woman standing next to him as if in trouble, nodding at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered the last conversation I had with her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a calm turmoil in my heart.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Safe area is activated]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Entrance capacity: 4/4]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Relocation' begins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The apostle siblings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 2nd Apostle Killer King and Literature Girl 64 participated in the War of the Absolute Throne.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The relocation lasted exactly one minute or so.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the raging fire burned everything in the 'safe zone', the maze moved and the composition of the passage changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as the relocation was over, Killer King found the body of Gu Taesung, who was rolling nearby.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Look. This guy had other plans."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In Killer King's hand, there was a 'poison bomb'</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered the expression on the face of Gu Taesung as he put his hand in the customs for the last time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was it really a bomb that Gu Taesung was trying to take out?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King added, as if he had read my expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't feel guilty. Just think that a person you don't know is dead. You don't grieve over someone dying on the other side of the globe."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Clearly he was a stranger to me. I don't know his name, his face, or where he lives.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"They used anonymity to commit crimes. No need to sympathize."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it really a problem that can be overcome?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What would you say if you were Dansu ahjussi?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pursed my lips in search of words several times, but I did not know what to say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps, it's because I don't have a fragment of the real Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Have you been doing anything in the meantime?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead of talking about strangers, I decided to talk about people I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hmm."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King, who picked up the items in Gu Taesung's arms, stood up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A flag was tied to his forearm like an armband.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Black flag.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, Killer King has completed all of the 'King's Way' scenarios.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was natural.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is the second apostle who has read the 'Omniscient Reader' over a hundred times and his sponsor is the archangel Jophiel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It was a lot of work."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, Killer King, who checked my flag, was looking at Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Looks like there's been a lot going on there too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">We briefly shared what had happened so far.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Things after clearing the theater dungeon and being scattered in Chungmuro.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were places I didn't know about at all along Killer King's route, and there were hidden pieces that I hadn't even thought of.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I also briefly described the events that had occurred.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Things from going to Seoul Station to meeting the Beggar Sect, coming to Gwanghwamun and entering the dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I finally brought up the story of Dansu ahjussi, Killer King let out a short sigh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If it's Dansu, you mean the old man who was looking for his daughter."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You're right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">“It's difficult. The scenario is very different from the original."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"In order to obtain the death sword, seven star jewels are required. But if the man has five…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">When he brought up the story, I wondered if I done anything wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It reminded me of Killer King who killed Gu Taesung without hesitation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"As a reminder, if you're thinking of attacking Dansu ahjussi—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why do you think I would?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King frowned as if slightly offended.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The only enemy of the Seven Apostles is the Misreading association. I won't attack anyone else."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It looked like he had already killed a lot for that kind of thing, but there was no need to make useless tackles right away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Anyway, at this rate, there's a high chance that guy will collect all seven star jewels."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I think so too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even now, the Misreading association, who is scattered all over the maze, is trying to feed the man with the remaining star jewels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They will be looking for opportunities.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The guys from the Misreading association must be planning on summoning the death sword with the man as a sacrifice and only steal the item."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We have to find ahjussi before they do."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[2 hours and 58 minutes left until the relocation.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was still a lot of free time until the next relocation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is that the entire 'labyrinth' is reset, making it impossible to know the location of Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I need a guide. Do you have any related skills or attributes?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, neither Killer King nor Literature Girl  64 had the relevant skills or characteristics.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Literature Girl 64 and Shin Yoosoung were looking at each other a few steps away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King licked his lips.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The composition of the party is really bad. At this time, Yoo Sangah or Lee Gilyoung should have been there."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surely that was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt;, there are two incarnations that can find a way in a maze.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But now,  neither Yoo Sangah nor Lee Gilyoung were here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi, who was able to play the role of Lee Gilyoung, is wandering around the labyrinth as a monster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We have to find a way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A way to find Dansu ahjussi before the guys from the Misreading association.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought about it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What would Kim Dokja do?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that the message resonated in my head.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[All repairs from Record Repairer have ended.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, the repair of the 'record repairer' is over.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I didn't have high expectations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The person I possessed now is Cheon Inho, and even if Cheon Inho's records were corrected, it didn't seem like there would be any major changes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Record Repairer' repairs skills that were inactive.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">An unexpected message came.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been activated.]</p></div>
