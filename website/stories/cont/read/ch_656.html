<p class="orv_line">&quot;Uh. Aaaaaaaa!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A scream that rang out a beat late.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Taesung was lucky. The legs of the guy were rolling on the floor. Stopping the pouring blood, he was looking up at me with red eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The emotion in his eyes quickly turned to fear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Taesung, perhaps forgetting the pain, began to servilely pray.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Save me! Save me!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I approached the guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at his terrified face reminded me of Dansu ahjussi’s face. Dansu ahjussi, who had blank eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Taesung was full of wounds, and a man who lost his mind was looking for his daughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s all because of Dansu ahjussi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">They made Dansu ahjussi that way. They ruined the life of an innocent ahjussi who was searching for his daughter in this world.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「They must be killed.」</div>「They must be killed.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The remnants of Yoo Jonghyuk inside of me were saying that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ho, are you by any chance a reader?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Taesung suddenly lifted his head and said while holding onto my trousers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Save me. Please, please save me! We&#x27;re from the same world.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I saw the trembling face looking up at me, I realized who this man was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This man is not &#x27;old-fashioned&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I am also a person who has read &#x27;The Book of Revelation&#x27;. I really enjoyed it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s all a misunderstanding... It&#x27;s a misunderstanding! I&#x27;m different from the others! I didn&#x27;t read all of them illegally, and I paid for a lot of them!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Like a condemned prisoner confessing his sins for the last time before he dies, he continued to talk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I want to live. I want to live. Please. I want to go back home. I didn&#x27;t want to come to a place like this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As he said that, he shed tears as if he was overwhelmed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Uh, I miss Mom and Dad. Fuck. I didn&#x27;t want to do this either. Just, just to survive somehow...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">How old was this man?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Where did he live and what did he do?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I do not know. Then and now, this man was a complete stranger to me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「So maybe, this is the last chance to kill this man.」</div>「So maybe, this is the last chance to kill this man.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I make up my mind and fixed &#x27;Broken Faith&#x27; again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will do it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung passed me by and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I have to practice too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Practice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;To survive.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung&#x27;s voice was low when she said that. I couldn&#x27;t see the child&#x27;s expression, but I could see why.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung&#x27;s eyes would be golden now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You don&#x27;t want to do that, ahjussi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it small? Shin Yoosoung&#x27;s small back as she spat those words made me feel the years I did not know. She must have been a child who had only lived for ten years.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grabbed Shin Yoosoung&#x27;s shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ll do it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the meantime, Gu Taesung dragged his butt and retreated to the edge. But he had nowhere to run.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Relocate&#x27; will begin in 1 minute.]</div>['Relocate' will begin in 1 minute.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he gets out of this &#x27;safe area&#x27; anyway, he will be burned to death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Taesung, perhaps realizing his situation, began to pray again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Please help me. I really didn’t want to do this either. They said that if I just performed my role well, I would be sent home.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The one possessed by Gu Taesung was a member of the &#x27;Misreading association&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I don&#x27;t know how the &#x27;Misreading association&#x27; came to this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were not readers who purchased and read the entire book, nor were they participants in &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27;s Banquet&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, how did they possess this world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Taesung swallowed his breath at the sharpness of the blade pressing down on his throat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who brought you here?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That, that&#x27;s…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Taesung opened his mouth again, as if he had made up his mind on something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Dok—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsutsutsutsu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, his whole body jumped up like an electrocuted fish. The boy&#x27;s lips were on fire.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something was controlling the guy&#x27;s right to speak.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Relocate&#x27; will begin in 30 seconds.]</div>['Relocate' will begin in 30 seconds.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Taesung, who twisted his body as if in pain, managed to part his lips.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m sorry. I can&#x27;t tell you that. I&#x27;ll do anything else instead. Anything I can—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at such a man, and the remnants of the Yoo Jonghyuk that remained in my head did not speak to me anymore. Maybe it was because my heart was a little weak, but what came to my mind instead was the memory of Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;No matter how much it is in a novel, I don&#x27;t want to kill anyone.&quot;」</div>「"No matter how much it is in a novel, I don't want to kill anyone."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">After the scenarios started, ahjussi hadn&#x27;t killed anyone until now. Even now, when he lost his reason and became a monster, he kept repeating the words &quot;I won&#x27;t kill you&quot;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Obviously, the fragment of Kim Dokja inside ahjussi must be the best and purest piece of Kim Dokja.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Because it&#x27;s a novel that my daughter liked.&quot;」</div>「"Because it's a novel that my daughter liked."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly lowered the sword that I was raising.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[After 20 seconds, &#x27;Rearrangement&#x27; will begin.]</div>[After 20 seconds, 'Rearrangement' will begin.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Taesung&#x27;s complexion brightened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thank you! Thank you!&quot; Gu Taesung shed tears of relief and put his hand on his chest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I-I don&#x27;t have much, but even this-&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I tried to say I didn&#x27;t need it, I felt my bones soften.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something was approaching at great speed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung caught me as if she felt something strange, and I also covered Shin Yoosoung as if to protect her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The magic wave that flew in with a squeaking sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I reflexively grasped &#x27;Broken Faith&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Broken Faith&#x27;s durability has run out.]</div>[Broken Faith's durability has run out.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">In an instant, I realized something.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「This is not an attack aimed at us.」</div>「This is not an attack aimed at us.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The magic wave passed me and Shin Yoosoung, and blew Gu Taesung&#x27;s neck.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a tragedy that took place without a chance to stop it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The magic, that came into the safe area in an instant, turned Gu Taesung&#x27;s hair into a green circle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s still backing down.&quot; A familiar voice said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A man in a black coat was there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Quite a handsome face for an extra.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A unique way of speaking that imitates Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The king of kings doesn&#x27;t act that way. What&#x27;s the point of worrying about killing the wicked?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw a woman standing next to him as if in trouble, nodding at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered the last conversation I had with her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a calm turmoil in my heart.</p>

<p class="orv_line">The apostle siblings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 2nd Apostle Killer King and Literature Girl 64 participated in the War of the Absolute Throne.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The relocation lasted exactly one minute or so.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the raging fire burned everything in the &#x27;safe zone&#x27;, the maze moved and the composition of the passage changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as the relocation was over, Killer King found the body of Gu Taesung, who was rolling nearby.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Look. This guy had other plans.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In Killer King&#x27;s hand, there was a &#x27;poison bomb&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered the expression on the face of Gu Taesung as he put his hand in the customs for the last time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was it really a bomb that Gu Taesung was trying to take out?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King added, as if he had read my expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#x27;t feel guilty. Just think that a person you don&#x27;t know is dead. You don&#x27;t grieve over someone dying on the other side of the globe.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Clearly he was a stranger to me. I don&#x27;t know his name, his face, or where he lives.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They used anonymity to commit crimes. No need to sympathize.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it really a problem that can be overcome?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What would you say if you were Dansu ahjussi?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pursed my lips in search of words several times, but I did not know what to say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps, it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t have a fragment of the real Kim Dokja&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Have you been doing anything in the meantime?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead of talking about strangers, I decided to talk about people I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hmm.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King, who picked up the items in Gu Taesung&#x27;s arms, stood up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A flag was tied to his forearm like an armband.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Black flag.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, Killer King has completed all of the &#x27;King&#x27;s Way&#x27; scenarios.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was natural.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is the second apostle who has read the &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27; over a hundred times and his sponsor is the archangel Jophiel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It was a lot of work.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, Killer King, who checked my flag, was looking at Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Looks like there&#x27;s been a lot going on there too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We briefly shared what had happened so far.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Things after clearing the theater dungeon and being scattered in Chungmuro.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were places I didn&#x27;t know about at all along Killer King&#x27;s route, and there were hidden pieces that I hadn&#x27;t even thought of.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I also briefly described the events that had occurred.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Things from going to Seoul Station to meeting the Beggar Sect, coming to Gwanghwamun and entering the dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I finally brought up the story of Dansu ahjussi, Killer King let out a short sigh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If it&#x27;s Dansu, you mean the old man who was looking for his daughter.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;re right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">“It&#x27;s difficult. The scenario is very different from the original.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;In order to obtain the death sword, seven star jewels are required. But if the man has five…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When he brought up the story, I wondered if I done anything wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It reminded me of Killer King who killed Gu Taesung without hesitation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As a reminder, if you&#x27;re thinking of attacking Dansu ahjussi—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why do you think I would?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King frowned as if slightly offended.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The only enemy of the Seven Apostles is the Misreading association. I won&#x27;t attack anyone else.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It looked like he had already killed a lot for that kind of thing, but there was no need to make useless tackles right away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Anyway, at this rate, there&#x27;s a high chance that guy will collect all seven star jewels.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I think so too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even now, the Misreading association, who is scattered all over the maze, is trying to feed the man with the remaining star jewels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They will be looking for opportunities.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The guys from the Misreading association must be planning on summoning the death sword with the man as a sacrifice and only steal the item.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We have to find ahjussi before they do.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[2 hours and 58 minutes left until the relocation.]</div>[2 hours and 58 minutes left until the relocation.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was still a lot of free time until the next relocation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is that the entire &#x27;labyrinth&#x27; is reset, making it impossible to know the location of Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I need a guide. Do you have any related skills or attributes?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, neither Killer King nor Literature Girl  64 had the relevant skills or characteristics.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Literature Girl 64 and Shin Yoosoung were looking at each other a few steps away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King licked his lips.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The composition of the party is really bad. At this time, Yoo Sangah or Lee Gilyoung should have been there.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surely that was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt;, there are two incarnations that can find a way in a maze.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But now,  neither Yoo Sangah nor Lee Gilyoung were here.</p>
<p class="orv_line"> Dansu ahjussi, who was able to play the role of Lee Gilyoung, is wandering around the labyrinth as a monster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We have to find a way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A way to find Dansu ahjussi before the guys from the Misreading association.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought about it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What would Kim Dokja do?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that the message resonated in my head.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[All repairs from Record Repairer have ended.]</div>[All repairs from Record Repairer have ended.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, the repair of the &#x27;record repairer&#x27; is over.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The person I possessed now is Cheon Inho, and even if Cheon Inho&#x27;s records were corrected, it didn&#x27;t seem like there would be any major changes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Record Repairer&#x27; repairs skills that were inactive.]</div>['Record Repairer' repairs skills that were inactive.]</p>
