<br>
<p class="orv_line">The author of Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At his words, the room erupted in confusion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Really?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No matter how you look at it, he&#39;s not Han Sooyoung.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then he&#39;s the writer of our world line?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye looked like they didn&#39;t know what he was talking about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are they talking about? Is he famous?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m going to look around for a while.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, I&#39;ll go with you, unni.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon glanced in my direction and walked away as if she wasn&#39;t interested, and Lee Jihye</p>
<p class="orv_line">followed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, there was such a description in Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">didn&#39;t understand at all. It is like they&#39;re NPCs... No matter how serious I am, they just take it as a</p>
<p class="orv_line">joke.&quot;」</p>
<p class="orv_line">When the prophets told the characters about &#39;Ways of Survival&#39;, they acted like they didn&#39;t</p>
<p class="orv_line">understand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe that&#39;s why Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye aren&#39;t showing much interest right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who was watching, quickly came to my side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is he really the writer?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A man wearing a plausible white coat and carrying a sword that&#39;s supposedly &#39;Broken Faith&#39;.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The white coat could have been picked up somewhere, and the sword could have been acquired</p>
<p class="orv_line">quickly enough.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, those items don&#39;t provide any guarantee that he&#39;s a writer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I wasn&#39;t convinced he was lying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s possible that I&#39;m not the only writer that&#39;s been transmigrated. For example, he could be an</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Omniscient Reader&#39;s&#39; writer from another world line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, I had a way to verify that.</p>
[Using &#39;Readers&#39; Comments List&#39; in this person.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the next system window that popped up in front of me, I doubted my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Huh? Wait a minute.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This asshole........</p>
<p class="orv_line">While I was checking his information with [Readers&#39; Comments List], Kyung Sein unexpectedly</p>
<p class="orv_line">stepped forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Writer-nim. I sent you an article on how to stretch, do you remember?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yes, he had sent me one of those.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The writer replied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That...... I don&#39;t remember all the messages either. It&#39;s only one message from you, but I have</p>
<p class="orv_line">thousands of other messages to read.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#39;t something I said that much, but if you send me something in a direct message, like how</p>
<p class="orv_line">to do a stretch, I&#39;ll remember it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I still do those stretches from time to time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t remember.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;D-don&#39;t worry.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein lowered her hand with a grimace.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The self-proclaimed writer added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But if I had known it was from such a beautiful woman, of course I would have remembered.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein looked dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It gave me goosebumps in more ways than one. I should probably say something to save face,</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you really the writer?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The cheolgon woman took the lead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How are you going to prove it? You don&#39;t have to be the writer to get something like &#39;Broken</p>
<p class="orv_line">Faith&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">True. That&#39;s right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you&#39;re really the writer, shouldn&#39;t you have at least created &#39;Unbroken Faith&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s...... Not even the real writer could make it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The asshole writer replied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Even if I&#39;m the writer, I can&#39;t control every situation, which is why I didn&#39;t get the &#39;random item</p>
<p class="orv_line">box&#39;. Maybe one of you here used it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi and Kyung Sein glanced back at me at this logical statement.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wouldn&#39;t we be able to tell if we used [Lie Detection]?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The person who said that was the one who shouted out &#39;has anyone read Omniscient Reader&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">earlier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A few readers shook their heads.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, right. [Lie Detection].&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But I wonder if anyone has that skill right now.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Seeing as how no one else has stepped forward, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an incarnation of [Lie</p>
<p class="orv_line">Detection] here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That said, Apostles like Killer King and Ye Hyunwoo were the exception.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Normally, no one would have gotten [Lie Detection] at this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the writer signaled to the woman beside him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She had a big hood drawn and her face covered with a mask.</p>
[Someone has used &#39;Lie Detection&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The message was heard by everyone.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">There was a murmur of surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The asshole writer opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;ll prove it. I&#39;m the one who wrote &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint&#39;.&quot;</p>
[&#39;Lie Detection&#39; has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The readers were stunned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is it true?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re really the writer?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Excited voices asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But some readers still didn&#39;t believe it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time, it was the cheolgon woman.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait. Are you really the writer who wrote for &#39;Sirius&#39; and &#39;Textia&#39;? Say it one more time.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">But even the cheolgon woman&#39;s tone had changed; she was flustered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s right. Verify it again!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;She just verified it. I think he&#39;s really the writer.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even the readers began to disagree.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the center of the debate, I saw the writer with a sour look on his face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know you won&#39;t believe me no matter what I say. There&#39;s no point in me proving it over and</p>
<p class="orv_line">over again.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He sighed softly and slowly looked around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If nothing else, he was a good actor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder where they teach how to talk like a writer these days.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I can promise you one thing, though: if you stick with me from now on, I&#39;ll take you to the end</p>
<p class="orv_line">of the story, no matter what it takes.&quot;</p>
[&#39;Lie Detection&#39; has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As if on cue, the asshole writer added.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I have more complete information than anyone else about Omniscient Reader. If you will trust</p>
<p class="orv_line">me, I will lead you down a path where there are no wrong answers.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a brief silence in the room.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Elevated, the readers looked at each other.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He must be for real.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, if it&#39;s [Lie Detection], I can believe it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Isn&#39;t that enough proof?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait, you believe that easily? [Lie Detection] isn&#39;t always accurateᅳ&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were still a few voices of disbelief, including the cheolgon woman, but the tide was slowly</p>
<p class="orv_line">turning in the writer&#39;s favor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps it was time to step in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m curious, writer-nim.&quot;</p>
[The exclusive skill &#39;Incite Lv.6&#39; is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At my words, the readers turned to look at me at the same time. No wonder. My Incite was now</p>
<p class="orv_line">on level 6.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I farted, everyone would stare at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re not even Han Sooyoung, do you really have &#39;perfect information&#39; about this world?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The readers suddenly had keen eyes as if they smelled a fart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Come to think of it—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wasn&#39;t it a setting that you were just dictating what Han Sooyoung wrote about Omniscient</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reader?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The writer&#39;s complexion changed with the creeping public opinion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I added as if I were letting go of the leash.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, but since you&#39;re the writer, you might know something we don&#39;t, for example....... the</p>
<p class="orv_line">identity of &#39;RepresentativeKimDokja&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of someone breathing in quietly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The writer replied.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know that much either.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s good. He can say he doesn&#39;t know something he doesn&#39;t know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because you can&#39;t prove it with [Lie Detection].</p>
<p class="orv_line">But he made one mistake.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hmmm. You don&#39;t know that either. You do know more about &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39; than us,</p>
<p class="orv_line">right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see the corner of the writer&#39;s mouth twitch.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, then, do you mind if I quiz you on a few quick Omniscient Reader trivia questions that</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Slowly, his eyes moved upward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was probably looking at &#39;the manuscript&#39; in his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sure.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Okay, here&#39;s the first question. . In &#39;Ways of Survival&#39;, Yoo Joonghyuk regresses 1,863 times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What does the number &#39;1,863&#39; symbolize?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">For the first time, the guy&#39;s complexion changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What do you mean symbol, that&#39;s.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You don&#39;t know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course you don&#39;t. Because I didn&#39;t either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Since you don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll give you the answer: 1,863 is the year that the world&#39;s first subway</p>
<p class="orv_line">opened.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I heard a muffled laugh nearby.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Presumably, some of them had attended &#39;Kim Dokja&#39;s Banquet&#39; that day.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The writer protested.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How do you get a question like that right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, if that was too hard for you, I&#39;ll give you a second, easier one: How many times does ⬛</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">appear in total in the entire &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The laughter around us intensified.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, the writer&#39;s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you trying to play a joke?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s right. I&#39;ve been making fun of him so far.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s the last question that counts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Was that too hard for you? Then I&#39;ll give you one last question, and if you get it right, I&#39;ll</p>
<p class="orv_line">acknowledge you as the writer. It&#39;s a really easy one, and the answer appears in &#39;Omniscient</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reader&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I hope it&#39;s a proper question.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Okay, third question. The rest of you may know the answer, but you&#39;re not allowed to guess.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced around at the readers, then said the final question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How many turns does it take for Yoo Joonghyuk to realize that if he uses the &#39;Absolute Throne&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">even once, he will not be able to reach the end of the scenarios?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A few readers looked like they knew the answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a question that the hardcore readers would know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was also a question that the author of &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39; would never know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The writer replied with a wry smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;14 turns.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I clapped my hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow, that&#39;s great.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So now—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I heard you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A small chattering sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The asshole writer frowned and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What....... it&#39;s really the 14th turn. I didn&#39;t hear it. It&#39;s from chapter 72 of &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39;.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s right, it&#39;s from chapter 72.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued with a low sigh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Or, to be more precise, it appears in the &#39;unrevised manuscript&#39; of chapter 72.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see his expression slowly harden.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That information was a typo, and there was even a correction notice posted later. Yoo</p>
<p class="orv_line">Joonghyuk learns the secret of the &#39;Absolute Throne&#39; in the 41st turn, not in the 14th turn.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The mood in the room quickly turned cold.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m curious, why do you remember it as an &#39;unrevised manuscript&#39; version, when you even wrote</p>
<p class="orv_line">the revision notice yourself?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The white-faced writer twitched his lips for the umpteenth time before opening his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, that was.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this point, it no longer mattered if he was the writer or not.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because the pompous &#39;writer&#39; didn&#39;t know any more about &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39; than the average</p>
<p class="orv_line">reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as I saw the look in his eyes, I knew what was coming.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How can you believe that? There&#39;s no one here who remembers such information, who are</p>
<p class="orv_line">you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why do I remember it? I could tell them right now, very simply, but I didn&#39;t want to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because this is not a &#39;writer&#39;s&#39; story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;ve read Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint over a hundred times.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The writer smirked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if no human being could be so ridiculous, he signaled to the woman beside him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the next moment.</p>
[&#39;Lie Detection&#39; has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Everyone opened their mouths in disbelief.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth to join in.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You don&#39;t have any exclusive information, and even the information we&#39;ve heard...... that makes</p>
<p class="orv_line">me wonder.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced at the readers, then at the writer, smirked, and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What the hell did you write?&quot;</p>

<p class="orv_line">While I was checking the equipment, a few readers came over to greet me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You were amazing earlier.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you really read it over 100 times?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I responded with only a light smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, I could see the writer&#39;s face glaring at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered the information from the list I&#39;d seen about him.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Crucially, it even said that he took an &#39;abnormal path&#39; to read &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My conclusion is this.</p>
「That guy is from the Misreading Association.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He wasn&#39;t even a normal member of the Misreading Association.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because what he said about being &#39;the one who wrote Omniscient Reader&#39; was proven to</p>
