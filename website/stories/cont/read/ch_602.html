<br>
<p class="orv_line">The author of Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At his words, the room erupted in confusion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Really?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No matter how you look at it, he&#x27;s not Han Sooyoung.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then he&#x27;s the writer of our world line?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye looked like they didn&#x27;t know what he was talking about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are they talking about? Is he famous?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m going to look around for a while.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, I&#x27;ll go with you, unni.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon glanced in my direction and walked away as if she wasn&#x27;t interested, and Lee Jihye</p>
<p class="orv_line">followed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, there was such a description in Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">didn&#x27;t understand at all. It is like they&#x27;re NPCs... No matter how serious I am, they just take it as a</p>
<p class="orv_line">joke.&quot;」</p>
<p class="orv_line">When the prophets told the characters about &#x27;Ways of Survival&#x27;, they acted like they didn&#x27;t</p>
<p class="orv_line">understand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe that&#x27;s why Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye aren&#x27;t showing much interest right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who was watching, quickly came to my side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is he really the writer?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A man wearing a plausible white coat and carrying a sword that&#x27;s supposedly &#x27;Broken Faith&#x27;.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The white coat could have been picked up somewhere, and the sword could have been acquired</p>
<p class="orv_line">quickly enough.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, those items don&#x27;t provide any guarantee that he&#x27;s a writer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I wasn&#x27;t convinced he was lying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;m not the only writer that&#x27;s been transmigrated. For example, he could be an</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27;s&#x27; writer from another world line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, I had a way to verify that.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Using &#x27;Readers&#x27; Comments List&#x27; in this person.]</div>[Using 'Readers' Comments List' in this person.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the next system window that popped up in front of me, I doubted my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Huh? Wait a minute.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This asshole........</p>
<p class="orv_line">While I was checking his information with [Readers&#x27; Comments List], Kyung Sein unexpectedly</p>
<p class="orv_line">stepped forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Writer-nim. I sent you an article on how to stretch, do you remember?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yes, he had sent me one of those.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The writer replied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That...... I don&#x27;t remember all the messages either. It&#x27;s only one message from you, but I have</p>
<p class="orv_line">thousands of other messages to read.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#x27;t something I said that much, but if you send me something in a direct message, like how</p>
<p class="orv_line">to do a stretch, I&#x27;ll remember it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I still do those stretches from time to time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m sorry I don&#x27;t remember.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;D-don&#x27;t worry.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein lowered her hand with a grimace.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The self-proclaimed writer added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But if I had known it was from such a beautiful woman, of course I would have remembered.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein looked dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It gave me goosebumps in more ways than one. I should probably say something to save face,</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you really the writer?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The cheolgon woman took the lead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How are you going to prove it? You don&#x27;t have to be the writer to get something like &#x27;Broken</p>
<p class="orv_line">Faith&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">True. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you&#x27;re really the writer, shouldn&#x27;t you have at least created &#x27;Unbroken Faith&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s...... Not even the real writer could make it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The asshole writer replied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Even if I&#x27;m the writer, I can&#x27;t control every situation, which is why I didn&#x27;t get the &#x27;random item</p>
<p class="orv_line">box&#x27;. Maybe one of you here used it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi and Kyung Sein glanced back at me at this logical statement.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wouldn&#x27;t we be able to tell if we used [Lie Detection]?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The person who said that was the one who shouted out &#x27;has anyone read Omniscient Reader&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">earlier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A few readers shook their heads.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, right. [Lie Detection].&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But I wonder if anyone has that skill right now.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Seeing as how no one else has stepped forward, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an incarnation of [Lie</p>
<p class="orv_line">Detection] here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That said, Apostles like Killer King and Ye Hyunwoo were the exception.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Normally, no one would have gotten [Lie Detection] at this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the writer signaled to the woman beside him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She had a big hood drawn and her face covered with a mask.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Someone has used &#x27;Lie Detection&#x27;.]</div>[Someone has used 'Lie Detection'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The message was heard by everyone.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">There was a murmur of surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The asshole writer opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ll prove it. I&#x27;m the one who wrote &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27;s Viewpoint&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Lie Detection&#x27; has confirmed that the statement is true.]</div>['Lie Detection' has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The readers were stunned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is it true?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;re really the writer?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Excited voices asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But some readers still didn&#x27;t believe it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time, it was the cheolgon woman.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait. Are you really the writer who wrote for &#x27;Sirius&#x27; and &#x27;Textia&#x27;? Say it one more time.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">But even the cheolgon woman&#x27;s tone had changed; she was flustered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s right. Verify it again!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;She just verified it. I think he&#x27;s really the writer.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even the readers began to disagree.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the center of the debate, I saw the writer with a sour look on his face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know you won&#x27;t believe me no matter what I say. There&#x27;s no point in me proving it over and</p>
<p class="orv_line">over again.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He sighed softly and slowly looked around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If nothing else, he was a good actor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder where they teach how to talk like a writer these days.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I can promise you one thing, though: if you stick with me from now on, I&#x27;ll take you to the end</p>
<p class="orv_line">of the story, no matter what it takes.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Lie Detection&#x27; has confirmed that the statement is true.]</div>['Lie Detection' has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if on cue, the asshole writer added.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I have more complete information than anyone else about Omniscient Reader. If you will trust</p>
<p class="orv_line">me, I will lead you down a path where there are no wrong answers.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a brief silence in the room.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Elevated, the readers looked at each other.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He must be for real.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, if it&#x27;s [Lie Detection], I can believe it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Isn&#x27;t that enough proof?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait, you believe that easily? [Lie Detection] isn&#x27;t always accurateᅳ&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were still a few voices of disbelief, including the cheolgon woman, but the tide was slowly</p>
<p class="orv_line">turning in the writer&#x27;s favor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps it was time to step in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m curious, writer-nim.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill &#x27;Incite Lv.6&#x27; is activated!]</div>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.6' is activated!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">At my words, the readers turned to look at me at the same time. No wonder. My Incite was now</p>
<p class="orv_line">on level 6.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I farted, everyone would stare at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;re not even Han Sooyoung, do you really have &#x27;perfect information&#x27; about this world?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The readers suddenly had keen eyes as if they smelled a fart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Come to think of it—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wasn&#x27;t it a setting that you were just dictating what Han Sooyoung wrote about Omniscient</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reader?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The writer&#x27;s complexion changed with the creeping public opinion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I added as if I were letting go of the leash.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, but since you&#x27;re the writer, you might know something we don&#x27;t, for example....... the</p>
<p class="orv_line">identity of &#x27;RepresentativeKimDokja&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of someone breathing in quietly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The writer replied.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t know that much either.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s good. He can say he doesn&#x27;t know something he doesn&#x27;t know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because you can&#x27;t prove it with [Lie Detection].</p>
<p class="orv_line">But he made one mistake.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hmmm. You don&#x27;t know that either. You do know more about &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27; than us,</p>
<p class="orv_line">right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see the corner of the writer&#x27;s mouth twitch.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, then, do you mind if I quiz you on a few quick Omniscient Reader trivia questions that</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Slowly, his eyes moved upward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was probably looking at &#x27;the manuscript&#x27; in his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sure.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Okay, here&#x27;s the first question. . In &#x27;Ways of Survival&#x27;, Yoo Joonghyuk regresses 1,863 times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What does the number &#x27;1,863&#x27; symbolize?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">For the first time, the guy&#x27;s complexion changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What do you mean symbol, that&#x27;s.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You don&#x27;t know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course you don&#x27;t. Because I didn&#x27;t either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Since you don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;ll give you the answer: 1,863 is the year that the world&#x27;s first subway</p>
<p class="orv_line">opened.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I heard a muffled laugh nearby.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Presumably, some of them had attended &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27;s Banquet&#x27; that day.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The writer protested.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How do you get a question like that right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, if that was too hard for you, I&#x27;ll give you a second, easier one: How many times does ⬛</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">appear in total in the entire &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The laughter around us intensified.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, the writer&#x27;s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you trying to play a joke?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s right. I&#x27;ve been making fun of him so far.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s the last question that counts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Was that too hard for you? Then I&#x27;ll give you one last question, and if you get it right, I&#x27;ll</p>
<p class="orv_line">acknowledge you as the writer. It&#x27;s a really easy one, and the answer appears in &#x27;Omniscient</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reader&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I hope it&#x27;s a proper question.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Okay, third question. The rest of you may know the answer, but you&#x27;re not allowed to guess.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced around at the readers, then said the final question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How many turns does it take for Yoo Joonghyuk to realize that if he uses the &#x27;Absolute Throne&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">even once, he will not be able to reach the end of the scenarios?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A few readers looked like they knew the answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a question that the hardcore readers would know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was also a question that the author of &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27; would never know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The writer replied with a wry smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;14 turns.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I clapped my hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow, that&#x27;s great.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So now—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I heard you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A small chattering sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The asshole writer frowned and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What....... it&#x27;s really the 14th turn. I didn&#x27;t hear it. It&#x27;s from chapter 72 of &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s from chapter 72.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued with a low sigh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Or, to be more precise, it appears in the &#x27;unrevised manuscript&#x27; of chapter 72.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see his expression slowly harden.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That information was a typo, and there was even a correction notice posted later. Yoo</p>
<p class="orv_line">Joonghyuk learns the secret of the &#x27;Absolute Throne&#x27; in the 41st turn, not in the 14th turn.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The mood in the room quickly turned cold.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m curious, why do you remember it as an &#x27;unrevised manuscript&#x27; version, when you even wrote</p>
<p class="orv_line">the revision notice yourself?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The white-faced writer twitched his lips for the umpteenth time before opening his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, that was.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this point, it no longer mattered if he was the writer or not.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because the pompous &#x27;writer&#x27; didn&#x27;t know any more about &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27; than the average</p>
<p class="orv_line">reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as I saw the look in his eyes, I knew what was coming.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How can you believe that? There&#x27;s no one here who remembers such information, who are</p>
<p class="orv_line">you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why do I remember it? I could tell them right now, very simply, but I didn&#x27;t want to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because this is not a &#x27;writer&#x27;s&#x27; story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ve read Omniscient Reader&#x27;s Viewpoint over a hundred times.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The writer smirked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if no human being could be so ridiculous, he signaled to the woman beside him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the next moment.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Lie Detection&#x27; has confirmed that the statement is true.]</div>['Lie Detection' has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Everyone opened their mouths in disbelief.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth to join in.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You don&#x27;t have any exclusive information, and even the information we&#x27;ve heard...... that makes</p>
<p class="orv_line">me wonder.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced at the readers, then at the writer, smirked, and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What the hell did you write?&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="orv_line">While I was checking the equipment, a few readers came over to greet me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You were amazing earlier.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you really read it over 100 times?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I responded with only a light smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, I could see the writer&#x27;s face glaring at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered the information from the list I&#x27;d seen about him.</p>
