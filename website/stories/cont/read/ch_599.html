<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Everything is white. An empty, blank space, like a manuscript page with nothing written on it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My thoughts blinked like a cursor.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Inho-ssi, how did you become a writer?"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked me that question when we were trapped inside the ichthyosaur.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Strangely, the answer didn't come to me immediately.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How did I become a writer?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The memory was distant and fuzzy.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「You're here?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I forced my eyes open and saw a snowy sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately realized where I was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A snowfield covered in white.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I slowly raised myself up, I saw the face of the protagonist I knew so well.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Kim Dokja.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja nodded. Just like the last time we met, he was still standing alone in the snowfield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He waved lightly at me, then squatted down and stared at the ground. He was looking so intently</p>
<p class="orv_line">at the ground that I couldn't help but approach and ask.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Is there something there?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja shook his head and smirked. His finger pointed down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a pitch black footprint.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't the original footprint.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were clearly recent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at my feet, then back up at the print.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then I slowly squatted down next to Kim Dokja.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I wanted to be strong like you.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know why I said that, it just came out of my mouth.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Like you.......」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「You know.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja said.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I'm not that strong.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As he said this, he slowly turned around and saw the vague trail of footsteps behind him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja, as if counting the footprints, said.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I just kept walking.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Keep walking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja continued.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「It's going to be very hard from now on.」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「......」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「It will be lonely.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After hearing those words, I felt really lonely. I said.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「This story won't have a happy ending.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja didn't answer for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We looked at the footprints. Footprints that had disappeared. Footprints that were being made.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And footprints that would be made.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja asked.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Will you be alright?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded slowly.</p>

<p class="orv_line">「As long as you keep reading.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja's eyes were on me. I felt awkward and averted his gaze.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He said.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Well, it's not supposed to be like that.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He hesitated, rummaged through his coat pockets, and placed something in my hand.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Take it. And.......」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my eyes with a sight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Chungmuro Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I put a hand on my forehead and raised my upper body. Kyung Sein's face came into view.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Everyone......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's okay, everyone's okay."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein squeezed my hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey, Inho-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that Dansoo ahjussi came to my side. He sat on his knees and stared at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His face looked like he was scolding me, or maybe he was worried.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But he didn't ask me anything, just hugged me quietly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then Kyung Sein next to us suddenly burst into tears and hugged us both.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In their arms, I looked out at the scenery of Chungmuro Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see the faces of the survivors.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu, Ye Hyunwoo and other people were building a fort at the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could also see a large tarp over the entrance to the stairwell to prevent the poisonous gas from</p>
<p class="orv_line">rising.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">On the bench, injured people were tending to their wounds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some incarnations fell asleep after eating the [Elaine Forest Essence].</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could also see Jung Heewon lying on the ground and Lee Jihye sitting on the bench, staring at</p>
<p class="orv_line">the tarp.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There are 3 hours and 39 minutes remaining until the end of the 'Emergency Defense Battle'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Bureau' is currently considering an early end to the 'Emergency Defense Battle'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A faint cheer erupted from the people building the fort.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Early termination of the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was an option the Bureau was considering.</p>
<p class="orv_line">obvious.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some constellations are asking if the results are out already.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations were getting tired of the scenario, and it was clear that more time here wasn't</p>
<p class="orv_line">going to change the outcome.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even now, behind that tarp, monsters were dying in real time from the poisonous fog.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at the thin membrane that separated the life and death of humans and monsters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah, Inho-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo spotted me and waved at me. I hesitantly waved back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A large shadow fell over my head. I looked up and saw a head glistening in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu frowned and ran his eyes down my arms and legs, each one scarred with the bite</p>
<p class="orv_line">marks of ground rats.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What were you going to do if you died?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I thought I wouldn't die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu stared at my face for a long time, as if he didn't like my answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thanks to you, we all lived."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swallowed hard.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't anyone else, it was Gong Pildu. The Ten Evil of Chungmuro Station. The second most</p>
<p class="orv_line">proud person in the entire Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He had just expressed his gratitude to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Gong Pildu's expression was a little strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What is that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I turned around and saw a ground rat's pup with its nose stuck in my side, calmly</p>
<p class="orv_line">breathing .</p>
<p class="orv_line">Several people freaked out when they saw it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No wonder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They had just been in a fight for their lives with the ground rats, and now they were seeing a</p>
<p class="orv_line">baby monster right in front of them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently frightened by their stares, the pup scurried into my arms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why did you bring it here?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I put my hand on the frightened pup's head and thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could have said I did it out of pity, or I could have said I felt guilty.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could have plausibly argued that there was no one here today who fought because they wanted</p>
<p class="orv_line">to fight, and that would have been the same for the monsters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you like dogs?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu was silent for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if reading our minds, the pup stuck its head out and looked at him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu stared at the pup, then asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Will you raise it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hadn't thought about it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if I could raise him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu slowly bent down and squatted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Max."</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu said in a scary voice. He spoke again, with a slight pause.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Max."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then with a whimper and a small cry, the ground rat pup hesitantly crawled out. After a</p>
<p class="orv_line">moment's hesitation, it scooted closer to Gong Pildu, sniffed, and wagged its tail.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu's pupils shook faintly. In his wrinkled face, the faintest hint of longing came and</p>
<p class="orv_line">went.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Have you ever had a dog?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead of answering me, Gong Pildu stared at the tarp-covered stairwell for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A dog would be perfect for guarding the land."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">After taking the ground rat pup away, Gong Pildu turned to the group and announced.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We're going to raise this guy."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Max yawned loudly in Gong Pildu's hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"As you can see from the way those guys fought earlier, they're very tenacious and strong</p>
<p class="orv_line">monsters. We're going to train him and use him as a guard dog. Anyone with a complaint, come</p>
<p class="orv_line">out now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">One of the men, who had been glaring at the pup the whole time, held up a hand in frustration.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What if it isn't well trained and attacks us?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"In that case, I will be responsible for killing it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu said firmly, and several men nodded. Some even hesitantly approached and took a</p>
<p class="orv_line">closer look at Max.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The pup is kind of cute in his own way."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh, is that what he'll be like when he grows up?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi, who was watching the scene from the sidelines, said.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">"When Jiyoon stayed in her room and read web novels."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I was in the living room watching old movies."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi, who rarely talks about himself, brought up the topic for the first time in a long</p>
<p class="orv_line">time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What kind of movies do you watch?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"King Kong, Godzilla, King Kong vs. Godzilla......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The daughter read Omniscient Reader in her room, while the father watched King Kong vs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Godzilla in the living room. With a firmly closed door between them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"When you watch a monster movie, there's always someone who takes pity on the monster and</p>
<p class="orv_line">tries to raise it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Every once in a while, Jiyoong would walk by and say something like, 'There are no humans</p>
<p class="orv_line">like that. How could people who were about to be eaten a moment ago want to raise the</p>
<p class="orv_line">monster'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, Gong Pildu was teaching Max, a ground rat, how to 'give the paw'. Max looked</p>
<p class="orv_line">up at him and licked his hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I wish I could have shown her this view."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu frowned, and the people in Chungmuro Station smirked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">People were laughing, like actors backstage after a curtain call. As if everything that happened</p>
<p class="orv_line">under that tarp was a lie.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some people got hurt, some people got killed, but some people laughed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They know that if they don't, they won't get to play the next scene.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Mate."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't want to watch a movie where my mate dies."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stare at the people laughing and talking, unable to answer.</p>

<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">As a reward for risking my life, I was mentally attacked by Kyung Sein for a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi, you're just like Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, I mean, who in their right mind would suddenly jump into a mischief of ground rats in that</p>
<p class="orv_line">situation? Aren't you actually Kim Dokja? Do you have the King of No Killing or something?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">That comment complicated my feelings quite a bit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I mean, I like Kim Dokja, but this was kind of.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Hey.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a small spark in the air, and Bihyung's voice called out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Are you up?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, Bihyung was also waiting for me to wake up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Yes, I'm awake.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung cleared his throat several times, then continued with a solemn voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I'm really surprised this time. I didn't think you'd start a story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time as he spoke, the logs that had been pushed aside suddenly appeared.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have accomplished an achievement that never existed before.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are beginning your first 'story' in the 3rd scenario.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A few constellations doubt your accomplishment.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some constellations are interested in your achievement.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A very small number of constellations have noticed your existence.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[10,000 coins have been sponsored.]</p></div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">It's an achievement that made the nebulae pay attention to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Considering this is only the third scenario, that's quite an accomplishment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Don't get cocky. Oh, do you even know what a story is?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I kind of know. If you collect them, you get stronger.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Well, it doesn't matter if you know that now....... Anyway, don't get carried away. You don't</p>
<p class="orv_line">have a story yet, just the germination of the first one, okay?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Yes.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't help but smile bitterly, it was as if he was trying to calm down a writer who was</p>
<p class="orv_line">excited about an unexpected box office hit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, as Bihyung said, I couldn't get cocky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My first story was still a seed, and I wasn't sure if it would ever bloom. And even if it did, there</p>
<p class="orv_line">was a chance it would be a bad one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You're the worst because you look obedient on the outside. Damn it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I listened to Bihyung's rambling, I remembered the beginning of Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The novice dokkaebi Bihyung was surprised and horrified by Kim Dokja's behavior.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Anyway, there will be additional rewards after the scenario is completed, since no other</p>
<p class="orv_line">incarnation has solved the 'Emergency Defense Battle' like you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What kind of ending will this world's Bihyung have?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will he become the Dokkaebi King of this world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Ha, by the way, this is really unusual. I can't believe there are already three people</p>
<p class="orv_line">germinating stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I paused for a moment, then asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'There's other ones?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who is it? Yoo Joonghyuk?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Yes. They're pretty famous now. One dark person, one white person.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">The dark person is definitely Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who is the white one?</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">'Can you tell me who they are?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Naturally, I can't give you that kind of information, but I think they're a little crazy. They keep</p>
<p class="orv_line">buying lemon candy from the 'dokkaebi bag'. It costs like 200 coins a piece.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Lemon candy?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Anyway, I have to go. I've got a lot of other noisy places to be right now. Damn, I shouldn't</p>
<p class="orv_line">have opened the Hidden Dungeon at a time like this.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, Bihyung disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I turned to Kyung Sein, who was still talking about Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sein-ssi. Has Yoo Joonghyuk returned yet?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, and you're still looking for Yoo Joonghyuk. Inho-ssi, you're really—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sein-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That bastard didn't even show his nose. Why?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As far as I can tell, there's only one place Yoo Joonghyuk could have gone if he wasn't</p>
<p class="orv_line">participating in the 'Emergency Defense Battle'.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The Theater Dungeon.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I had an ominous feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, Yoo Joonghyuk is strong in this world, so he won't die in the 'Theater Dungeon'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At least, that's how it was supposed to be.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Yoo Joonghyuk is stuck on the sunfish route again」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That comment from a few hours ago stuck with me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced at my surroundings and secretly opened my phone. The battery was almost dead.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new chapter has been updated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A new chapter already?</p>

<div class="orv_window">

</div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as I saw the title, Bihyung's words ran through my head.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「They keep buying lemon candy from the 'dokkaebi bag'.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I absentmindedly shoved my hand in my pocket.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since when?</p>
<p class="orv_line">In my pocket, there was something I'd never put there before.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Take it. And.......」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Too late, I remembered the words from my dream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took the object out of my pocket. Slowly, a chill ran down my spine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A small candy wrapped in a yellow shell.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surely, that's what Kim Dokja said.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Give it to him.」</p></div>
