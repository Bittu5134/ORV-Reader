<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Everything is white. An empty, blank space, like a manuscript page with nothing written on it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My thoughts blinked like a cursor.</p>
「&quot;Inho-ssi, how did you become a writer?&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked me that question when we were trapped inside the ichthyosaur.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Strangely, the answer didn&#39;t come to me immediately.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How did I become a writer?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The memory was distant and fuzzy.</p>
「You&#39;re here?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I forced my eyes open and saw a snowy sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately realized where I was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A snowfield covered in white.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I slowly raised myself up, I saw the face of the protagonist I knew so well.</p>
「Kim Dokja.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja nodded. Just like the last time we met, he was still standing alone in the snowfield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He waved lightly at me, then squatted down and stared at the ground. He was looking so intently</p>
<p class="orv_line">at the ground that I couldn&#39;t help but approach and ask.</p>
「Is there something there?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja shook his head and smirked. His finger pointed down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a pitch black footprint.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#39;t the original footprint.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were clearly recent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at my feet, then back up at the print.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then I slowly squatted down next to Kim Dokja.</p>
「I wanted to be strong like you.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know why I said that, it just came out of my mouth.</p>
「Like you.......」</p></div>
「You know.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja said.</p>
「I&#39;m not that strong.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As he said this, he slowly turned around and saw the vague trail of footsteps behind him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja, as if counting the footprints, said.</p>
「I just kept walking.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Keep walking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja continued.</p>
「It&#39;s going to be very hard from now on.」</p></div>
「......」</p></div>
「It will be lonely.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After hearing those words, I felt really lonely. I said.</p>
「This story won&#39;t have a happy ending.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja didn&#39;t answer for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We looked at the footprints. Footprints that had disappeared. Footprints that were being made.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And footprints that would be made.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja asked.</p>
「Will you be alright?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded slowly.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">「As long as you keep reading.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja&#39;s eyes were on me. I felt awkward and averted his gaze.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He said.</p>
「Well, it&#39;s not supposed to be like that.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He hesitated, rummaged through his coat pockets, and placed something in my hand.</p>
「Take it. And.......」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my eyes with a sight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Chungmuro Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I put a hand on my forehead and raised my upper body. Kyung Sein&#39;s face came into view.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Everyone.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s okay, everyone&#39;s okay.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein squeezed my hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey, Inho-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that Dansoo ahjussi came to my side. He sat on his knees and stared at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His face looked like he was scolding me, or maybe he was worried.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But he didn&#39;t ask me anything, just hugged me quietly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then Kyung Sein next to us suddenly burst into tears and hugged us both.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In their arms, I looked out at the scenery of Chungmuro Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see the faces of the survivors.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu, Ye Hyunwoo and other people were building a fort at the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could also see a large tarp over the entrance to the stairwell to prevent the poisonous gas from</p>
<p class="orv_line">rising.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">On the bench, injured people were tending to their wounds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some incarnations fell asleep after eating the [Elaine Forest Essence].</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could also see Jung Heewon lying on the ground and Lee Jihye sitting on the bench, staring at</p>
<p class="orv_line">the tarp.</p>
[There are 3 hours and 39 minutes remaining until the end of the &#39;Emergency Defense Battle&#39;.]</p></div>
[The &#39;Bureau&#39; is currently considering an early end to the &#39;Emergency Defense Battle&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A faint cheer erupted from the people building the fort.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Early termination of the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was an option the Bureau was considering.</p>
<p class="orv_line">obvious.]</p>
[Some constellations are asking if the results are out already.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations were getting tired of the scenario, and it was clear that more time here wasn&#39;t</p>
<p class="orv_line">going to change the outcome.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even now, behind that tarp, monsters were dying in real time from the poisonous fog.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at the thin membrane that separated the life and death of humans and monsters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah, Inho-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo spotted me and waved at me. I hesitantly waved back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A large shadow fell over my head. I looked up and saw a head glistening in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu frowned and ran his eyes down my arms and legs, each one scarred with the bite</p>
<p class="orv_line">marks of ground rats.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What were you going to do if you died?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I thought I wouldn&#39;t die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu stared at my face for a long time, as if he didn&#39;t like my answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thanks to you, we all lived.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swallowed hard.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#39;t anyone else, it was Gong Pildu. The Ten Evil of Chungmuro Station. The second most</p>
<p class="orv_line">proud person in the entire Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He had just expressed his gratitude to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Gong Pildu&#39;s expression was a little strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What is that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I turned around and saw a ground rat&#39;s pup with its nose stuck in my side, calmly</p>
<p class="orv_line">breathing .</p>
<p class="orv_line">Several people freaked out when they saw it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No wonder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They had just been in a fight for their lives with the ground rats, and now they were seeing a</p>
<p class="orv_line">baby monster right in front of them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently frightened by their stares, the pup scurried into my arms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why did you bring it here?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I put my hand on the frightened pup&#39;s head and thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could have said I did it out of pity, or I could have said I felt guilty.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could have plausibly argued that there was no one here today who fought because they wanted</p>
<p class="orv_line">to fight, and that would have been the same for the monsters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you like dogs?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu was silent for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if reading our minds, the pup stuck its head out and looked at him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu stared at the pup, then asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Will you raise it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hadn&#39;t thought about it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if I could raise him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu slowly bent down and squatted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Max.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu said in a scary voice. He spoke again, with a slight pause.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Max.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then with a whimper and a small cry, the ground rat pup hesitantly crawled out. After a</p>
<p class="orv_line">moment&#39;s hesitation, it scooted closer to Gong Pildu, sniffed, and wagged its tail.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu&#39;s pupils shook faintly. In his wrinkled face, the faintest hint of longing came and</p>
<p class="orv_line">went.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Have you ever had a dog?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead of answering me, Gong Pildu stared at the tarp-covered stairwell for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;A dog would be perfect for guarding the land.&quot;</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">After taking the ground rat pup away, Gong Pildu turned to the group and announced.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We&#39;re going to raise this guy.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Max yawned loudly in Gong Pildu&#39;s hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As you can see from the way those guys fought earlier, they&#39;re very tenacious and strong</p>
<p class="orv_line">monsters. We&#39;re going to train him and use him as a guard dog. Anyone with a complaint, come</p>
<p class="orv_line">out now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">One of the men, who had been glaring at the pup the whole time, held up a hand in frustration.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What if it isn&#39;t well trained and attacks us?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;In that case, I will be responsible for killing it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu said firmly, and several men nodded. Some even hesitantly approached and took a</p>
<p class="orv_line">closer look at Max.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The pup is kind of cute in his own way.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh, is that what he&#39;ll be like when he grows up?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi, who was watching the scene from the sidelines, said.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;When Jiyoon stayed in her room and read web novels.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I was in the living room watching old movies.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi, who rarely talks about himself, brought up the topic for the first time in a long</p>
<p class="orv_line">time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What kind of movies do you watch?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;King Kong, Godzilla, King Kong vs. Godzilla.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The daughter read Omniscient Reader in her room, while the father watched King Kong vs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Godzilla in the living room. With a firmly closed door between them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;When you watch a monster movie, there&#39;s always someone who takes pity on the monster and</p>
<p class="orv_line">tries to raise it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Every once in a while, Jiyoong would walk by and say something like, &#39;There are no humans</p>
<p class="orv_line">like that. How could people who were about to be eaten a moment ago want to raise the</p>
<p class="orv_line">monster&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, Gong Pildu was teaching Max, a ground rat, how to &#39;give the paw&#39;. Max looked</p>
<p class="orv_line">up at him and licked his hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I wish I could have shown her this view.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu frowned, and the people in Chungmuro Station smirked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">People were laughing, like actors backstage after a curtain call. As if everything that happened</p>
<p class="orv_line">under that tarp was a lie.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some people got hurt, some people got killed, but some people laughed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They know that if they don&#39;t, they won&#39;t get to play the next scene.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Mate.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t want to watch a movie where my mate dies.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stare at the people laughing and talking, unable to answer.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">As a reward for risking my life, I was mentally attacked by Kyung Sein for a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi, you&#39;re just like Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, I mean, who in their right mind would suddenly jump into a mischief of ground rats in that</p>
<p class="orv_line">situation? Aren&#39;t you actually Kim Dokja? Do you have the King of No Killing or something?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That comment complicated my feelings quite a bit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I mean, I like Kim Dokja, but this was kind of.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Hey.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a small spark in the air, and Bihyung&#39;s voice called out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Are you up?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, Bihyung was also waiting for me to wake up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Yes, I&#39;m awake.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung cleared his throat several times, then continued with a solemn voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I&#39;m really surprised this time. I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d start a story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time as he spoke, the logs that had been pushed aside suddenly appeared.</p>
[You have accomplished an achievement that never existed before.]</p></div>
[You are beginning your first &#39;story&#39; in the 3rd scenario.]</p></div>
[A few constellations doubt your accomplishment.]</p></div>
[Some constellations are interested in your achievement.]</p></div>
[A very small number of constellations have noticed your existence.]</p></div>
[10,000 coins have been sponsored.]</p></div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s an achievement that made the nebulae pay attention to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Considering this is only the third scenario, that&#39;s quite an accomplishment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Don&#39;t get cocky. Oh, do you even know what a story is?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;I kind of know. If you collect them, you get stronger.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Well, it doesn&#39;t matter if you know that now....... Anyway, don&#39;t get carried away. You don&#39;t</p>
<p class="orv_line">have a story yet, just the germination of the first one, okay?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Yes.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#39;t help but smile bitterly, it was as if he was trying to calm down a writer who was</p>
<p class="orv_line">excited about an unexpected box office hit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, as Bihyung said, I couldn&#39;t get cocky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My first story was still a seed, and I wasn&#39;t sure if it would ever bloom. And even if it did, there</p>
<p class="orv_line">was a chance it would be a bad one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You&#39;re the worst because you look obedient on the outside. Damn it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I listened to Bihyung&#39;s rambling, I remembered the beginning of Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The novice dokkaebi Bihyung was surprised and horrified by Kim Dokja&#39;s behavior.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Anyway, there will be additional rewards after the scenario is completed, since no other</p>
<p class="orv_line">incarnation has solved the &#39;Emergency Defense Battle&#39; like you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What kind of ending will this world&#39;s Bihyung have?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will he become the Dokkaebi King of this world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Ha, by the way, this is really unusual. I can&#39;t believe there are already three people</p>
<p class="orv_line">germinating stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I paused for a moment, then asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;There&#39;s other ones?&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who is it? Yoo Joonghyuk?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Yes. They&#39;re pretty famous now. One dark person, one white person.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">The dark person is definitely Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who is the white one?</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Can you tell me who they are?&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Naturally, I can&#39;t give you that kind of information, but I think they&#39;re a little crazy. They keep</p>
<p class="orv_line">buying lemon candy from the &#39;dokkaebi bag&#39;. It costs like 200 coins a piece.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Lemon candy?&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Anyway, I have to go. I&#39;ve got a lot of other noisy places to be right now. Damn, I shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p class="orv_line">have opened the Hidden Dungeon at a time like this.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, Bihyung disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I turned to Kyung Sein, who was still talking about Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sein-ssi. Has Yoo Joonghyuk returned yet?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, and you&#39;re still looking for Yoo Joonghyuk. Inho-ssi, you&#39;re really—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sein-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That bastard didn&#39;t even show his nose. Why?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As far as I can tell, there&#39;s only one place Yoo Joonghyuk could have gone if he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p class="orv_line">participating in the &#39;Emergency Defense Battle&#39;.</p>
「The Theater Dungeon.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I had an ominous feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, Yoo Joonghyuk is strong in this world, so he won&#39;t die in the &#39;Theater Dungeon&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At least, that&#39;s how it was supposed to be.</p>
「Yoo Joonghyuk is stuck on the sunfish route again」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That comment from a few hours ago stuck with me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced at my surroundings and secretly opened my phone. The battery was almost dead.</p>
[A new chapter has been updated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A new chapter already?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I absentmindedly scrolled through the list and stopped when I saw the new episode title.</p>
<br>
<div class="orv_window">
<p></p>
<p>Episode 10. Writer (1)</p>
<p></p>
</div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as I saw the title, Bihyung&#39;s words ran through my head.</p>
「They keep buying lemon candy from the &#39;dokkaebi bag&#39;.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I absentmindedly shoved my hand in my pocket.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since when?</p>
<p class="orv_line">In my pocket, there was something I&#39;d never put there before.</p>
「Take it. And.......」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Too late, I remembered the words from my dream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took the object out of my pocket. Slowly, a chill ran down my spine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A small candy wrapped in a yellow shell.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surely, that&#39;s what Kim Dokja said.</p>
「Give it to him.」</p></div>
