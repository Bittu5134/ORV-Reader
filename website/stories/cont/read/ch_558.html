<p class="orv_line">&quot;What the hell are you talking about?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first one to react to my declaration was the big guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#x27;ve written a lot of characters like him throughout my entire writing career, so I know what to do</p>
<p class="orv_line">when this happens.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tried to paraphrase Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;ve been fighting against an impenetrable wall, and now you&#x27;re done. As you&#x27;ve probably</p>
<p class="orv_line">realized by now, that&#x27;s not going to get you out of this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What? How do you know that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#x27;t turn a blind eye to reality.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Meeting my gaze, the big guy shivered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Unless you really want to die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A chill ran through the station as if someone had poured it with cold water.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The station&#x27;s incarnations are startled by your words.]</div>[The station's incarnations are startled by your words.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your exclusive attribute&#x27;s effect is strongly activated.]</div>[Your exclusive attribute's effect is strongly activated.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your influence in the scenario area becomes slightly stronger.]</div>[Your influence in the scenario area becomes slightly stronger.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">So this is my character&#x27;s attribute.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surprisingly, he&#x27;s not a bad character.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You might want to listen to this guy, he knows something about the situation.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the ahjussi added his well-timed comment, people turned to look at me and shook.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t miss the moment when the mood changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Now, as you all know, this is real. It&#x27;s not a movie shoot, it&#x27;s not a dream. Neither the police nor</p>
<p class="orv_line">the army will come running to save you, and if you mess up, you could really die. However, if</p>
<p class="orv_line">you listen to me, you&#x27;ll all be safe.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At last, a few people hesitantly gathered around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">About ten people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#x27;t a bad start.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A young man in the front row asked.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you, ahjussi, a soldier or a cop?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I used to be.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">My words added to the uproar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#x27;t a lie, as I had retired as a sergeant in the army.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that the deacon, who had been listening from afar, approached.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you really know something about this situation?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, I do.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There&#x27;s no point in going into detail, because frankly, no matter how I explain it, it&#x27;s not an easy</p>
<p class="orv_line">situation. If I suddenly told you that God was angry at your sins and sent you a trial, would you</p>
<p class="orv_line">believe me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I gave a lighthearted example, but the deacon&#x27;s eyes narrowed and he mumbled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sins...... trials......?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I must have touched the wrong switch.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The big guy who was listening to the conversation beside me got angry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you kidding me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Normally, his gruff demeanor would have intimidated me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But today&#x27;s Lee Hakhyun was different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Anyway, if you want to listen to me, listen to me, and if you don&#x27;t, go over there and keep</p>
<p class="orv_line">pushing against the wall. Honestly, I don&#x27;t care if only this ahjussi and I survive.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This kind of brazenness would have impressed even Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps the persuasion worked, a few people looked at each other and shared their opiniones.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The most active was the deacon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Brothers and sisters, let&#x27;s hear what he has to say.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s do it. We&#x27;re all going to live with it, aren&#x27;t we?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the mood shifted slightly in my direction, the big guy bit his lip and glanced at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, when we were being beaten up, we &#x27;deserved it&#x27;, but now we were all going to live</p>
<p class="orv_line">together?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took a breath and began to speak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Something happened that we can&#x27;t understand with our common sense. We were suddenly</p>
<p class="orv_line">trapped inside by an invisible wall, and we were given this thing called a &#x27;scenario&#x27;. First of all,</p>
<p class="orv_line">we need to start by acknowledging this as a reality. Do we agree on that?&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">People nodded hesitantly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If we don&#x27;t clear this scenario, we will die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do we really have to kill? No matter whatᅳ&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You have to believe that for now, as surreal as it seems. It&#x27;s better than making a bad decision</p>
<p class="orv_line">and dying. Have you checked the conditions for clearing the scenario?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kill one or more creatures.....&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Watching the people in front of me timidly close the distance between us, I took a step forward,</p>
<p class="orv_line">trying to be defiant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Gather a group of humans and ask them to kill a creature, which of course sounds like asking</p>
<p class="orv_line">them to kill each other, but there&#x27;s a trap in that statement.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What trap?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smirked, watching the big guy who said the same thing over and over again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You could have just told them to kill &#x27;humans&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Their eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then the solution is.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s simple. We just need to find another creature we can kill.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With that, I slammed the vending machine with all my might. Then I pointed to a cockroach that</p>
<p class="orv_line">scurried out from underneath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">People gasped as they realized.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If we all work together, we should be able to collect bugs quickly.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s do it, right now!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s all put down the vending machine!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">People now clung to the vending machine instead of the invisible wall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Their faces became livelier, perhaps because this time they had a sense of reality.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Push!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the vending machine was pushed, a can of soda fell out with the sound of shaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No one took the drink.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;One more time!&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The vending machine tilted, and soon I heard something break.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The next thing I know, bugs are falling out of the back of the machine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They&#x27;re out! Let&#x27;s catch them!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shouted to the rushing people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you catch a bug, don&#x27;t kill it, show it to me first!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What? Why?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued to speak firmly, despite their wary glances.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I need to see if it&#x27;s carrying eggs.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Eggs?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;An egg might qualify as a life form, so if we find one, we can all live.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah......!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Remember, you have other people&#x27;s lives in your hands. Only we can save each other.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">People glanced back at each other, then took off their shoes and socks and start catching bugs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some people hit the vending machines with their bags or fists, while others grabbed nearby fire</p>
<p class="orv_line">extinguishers and hit it with them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even the big guy who had been giving me a hard time joined in and kicked a vending machine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reader ahjussi —the one who&#x27;s daughter likes Kim Dokja— slowly came to my side and</p>
<p class="orv_line">asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you okay?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What about you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m fine.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We watched the bustling crowd.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wiping blood from the corner of his mouth, the reader ahjussi said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You decided to save them all.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">People scrambling to kill the bugs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This would change the story of Geumho Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Those who were supposed to kill people and survive would kill bugs and survive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe even that big guy who wasn&#x27;t in the original story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is it because of me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reader ahjussi lowered his head as if feeling guilty.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This will change the course of the entire novel, and we will face a future we don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I put my hand lightly on reader ahjussi&#x27;s shoulder.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#x27;t think about it. I was going to do this from the start.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The number of people who caught one, two, and more insects began to increase.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Among them was the deacon, who had already secured his share of bugs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s all thanks to you, brother. Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, it&#x27;s not.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps this deacon was meant to die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a strange pang of guilt at the thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How many people have died like this in my novel?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character &#x27;Kim Cheolyang&#x27; begins to trust you.]</div>[The character 'Kim Cheolyang' begins to trust you.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that I suddenly heard the character&#x27;s inner thoughts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart started to best fast.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt that something was finally coming.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, I had an exclusive skill.</p>

<p>personality and he&#x27;s crouching down.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Character Kim Cheolyang.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought the name sounded familiar, and then I remembered that I had written down a character</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">named Kim Cheolyang at some point.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, it was in one of over 10,000 notes, and I couldn&#x27;t recall any details since the character</p>
<p class="orv_line">was included in an abandoned setting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, for an extra character, his exclusive attribute is pretty interesting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Crouching Figure.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was originally Jung Heewon who had the Crouching Figure attribute in the original version of</p>
<p class="orv_line">the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Depending on the circumstances, this trait has the potential to put him on the list of the 100</p>
<p class="orv_line">strongest in the world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is he a great unknown character?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Cheolyang, who didn&#x27;t know what I was thinking, kept talking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s a good thing that this happened during the outdoor evangelism....... and I&#x27;m so glad we met</p>
<p class="orv_line">you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe the end of days has finally come, and like brother said, God is watching us.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He&#x27;s probably watching us pretty hard. Grabbing a handful of popcorn for every head that</p>
<p class="orv_line">explodes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think we&#x27;re doing pretty well with your help, though.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Shhh.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I understood why I abandoned this character.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How dare he say &#x27;pretty well&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That line is a trigger in &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Hoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shit. As expected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Here&#x27;s another one who&#x27;s playing tricks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The message was atypical.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A message that used the one-on-one dokkaebi communication instead of the official channels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was an ominous omen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no such development in the main story of &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Don&#x27;t make it obvious, just listen. I&#x27;m telling you this specifically because it&#x27;s funny.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I quickly lowered my gaze and pretended nothing happened, Bihyung continued talking</p>
<p class="orv_line">with satisfaction.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">—I see what you&#x27;re thinking, but you&#x27;d better use your judgment. The constellations don&#x27;t like</p>
<p class="orv_line">incarnations that are too smart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, Bihyung was talking because of his own personal benefit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe they didn&#x27;t like what I was doing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I laughed bitterly as I looked in the air where Bihyung might be.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What would you, a low level dokkaebi, know? I&#x27;m sure I know far better than you what the</p>
<p class="orv_line">constellations like.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Sometimes it&#x27;s wise not to think too hard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was all Bihyung said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Found it! I found another one!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We&#x27;re not quite there yet, we&#x27;ve got a lot of people left—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The trash can! Let&#x27;s look in the trash can, too!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The number of people trapped together was exactly twenty-two.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We needed to secure at least twenty-two bugs for everyone to survive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Found one!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Here, take another one!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were also people who had already caught bugs and were holding them for others. It was a</p>
<p class="orv_line">very moving scene.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was hard to believe that these were the same people who fought for food in the original</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The big guy picked up a large cockroach from afar and waved at me with a big smile on his face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey, is this one okay? It&#x27;s a living thing too, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There are 21 minutes remaining.]</div>[There are 21 minutes remaining.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The bustling crowd slowed down noticeably.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I turned to them and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is there anyone who hasn&#x27;t caught a bug yet?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">No one raised their hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Twenty-two bugs, to be exact. That was the same number of people trapped here. It was a clean</p>
<p class="orv_line">sweep, the best possible result, without having to search for bug eggs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey, can we kill it now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If we kill it, can we get out of here?&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Relief washed over their faces.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The pleasure that we had survived together without harming anyone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After carefully checking everyone&#x27;s hands for a bug, I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Brothers and sisters, let&#x27;s thank our insect brothers for their sacrifice!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With the deacon&#x27;s declaration, several people clapped their hands and slapped down the bugs</p>
<p class="orv_line">they held.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When the tension eased a bit, some people asked silly questions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Can I step on it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You don&#x27;t have to kill it with your hands, do you? You just have to kill it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I told them they could kill them any way they wanted, they started stomping on the bugs</p>
<p class="orv_line">like dirty children.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Squish!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Similar sounds echoed around the room.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even the big guy, who had torn off all the bugs&#x27; legs afraid that it would escape, crushed it with</p>
<p class="orv_line">his feet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Die! Die!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened the pocket that held the bug. The dead bug was there, along with some thick body</p>
<p class="orv_line">fluids. I must have squeezed it too tightly earlier when I tried to save the ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could hear the crowd cheering.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is it okay now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was a little worried about the change of the development at Geumho Station, but as I looked at</p>
<p class="orv_line">the reader ahjussi&#x27;s faintly smiling face, I realized that it was okay.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe now the people of Geumho Station will be able to live a completely different life from the</p>
<p class="orv_line">one I wrote.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Nothing happened, are you sure it&#x27;s over?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone asked anxiously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Has anything changed?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">People looked at each other and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This thing is dead, right? It&#x27;s it tough because it&#x27;s a bug?&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The big guy who had been trampling the bug in the corner questioned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know how many times he trampled on it because the giant bug was crushed by the sole of</p>
<p class="orv_line">his sneakers and I couldn&#x27;t find any trace of it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought back to the first scenario of &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27; and suddenly realized an eerie fact.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I turned to the reader ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ahjussi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you get the system message after you killed the bug earlier?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yeah. The scenario is cleared......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pulled out the dead bug from my pocket.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A bug that I couldn&#x27;t tell when it died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A chill ran down my spine.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I didn&#x27;t receive any system messages.」</div>「I didn't receive any system messages.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Author&#x27;s Note</p>
<p class="orv_line">Turn it off and on again.</p>
