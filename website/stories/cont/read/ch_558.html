            <div class="orv_title"><h1>558 Episode 2. Rewrite (3)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">"What the hell are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first one to react to my declaration was the big guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I've written a lot of characters like him throughout my entire writing career, so I know what to do</p>
<p class="orv_line">when this happens.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tried to paraphrase Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You've been fighting against an impenetrable wall, and now you're done. As you've probably</p>
<p class="orv_line">realized by now, that's not going to get you out of this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What? How do you know that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't turn a blind eye to reality."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Meeting my gaze, the big guy shivered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Unless you really want to die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A chill ran through the station as if someone had poured it with cold water.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The station's incarnations are startled by your words.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your exclusive attribute's effect is strongly activated.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your influence in the scenario area becomes slightly stronger.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">So this is my character's attribute.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surprisingly, he's not a bad character.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You might want to listen to this guy, he knows something about the situation."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the ahjussi added his well-timed comment, people turned to look at me and shook.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't miss the moment when the mood changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Now, as you all know, this is real. It's not a movie shoot, it's not a dream. Neither the police nor</p>
<p class="orv_line">the army will come running to save you, and if you mess up, you could really die. However, if</p>
<p class="orv_line">you listen to me, you'll all be safe."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At last, a few people hesitantly gathered around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">About ten people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't a bad start.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A young man in the front row asked.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you, ahjussi, a soldier or a cop?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I used to be."</p>
<p class="orv_line">My words added to the uproar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't a lie, as I had retired as a sergeant in the army.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that the deacon, who had been listening from afar, approached.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you really know something about this situation?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, I do."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There's no point in going into detail, because frankly, no matter how I explain it, it's not an easy</p>
<p class="orv_line">situation. If I suddenly told you that God was angry at your sins and sent you a trial, would you</p>
<p class="orv_line">believe me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I gave a lighthearted example, but the deacon's eyes narrowed and he mumbled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sins...... trials......?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I must have touched the wrong switch.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The big guy who was listening to the conversation beside me got angry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you kidding me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Normally, his gruff demeanor would have intimidated me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But today's Lee Hakhyun was different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Anyway, if you want to listen to me, listen to me, and if you don't, go over there and keep</p>
<p class="orv_line">pushing against the wall. Honestly, I don't care if only this ahjussi and I survive."</p>
<p class="orv_line">This kind of brazenness would have impressed even Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps the persuasion worked, a few people looked at each other and shared their opiniones.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The most active was the deacon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Brothers and sisters, let's hear what he has to say."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's do it. We're all going to live with it, aren't we?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the mood shifted slightly in my direction, the big guy bit his lip and glanced at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, when we were being beaten up, we 'deserved it', but now we were all going to live</p>
<p class="orv_line">together?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took a breath and began to speak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Something happened that we can't understand with our common sense. We were suddenly</p>
<p class="orv_line">trapped inside by an invisible wall, and we were given this thing called a 'scenario'. First of all,</p>
<p class="orv_line">we need to start by acknowledging this as a reality. Do we agree on that?"</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">People nodded hesitantly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If we don't clear this scenario, we will die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do we really have to kill? No matter whatᅳ"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You have to believe that for now, as surreal as it seems. It's better than making a bad decision</p>
<p class="orv_line">and dying. Have you checked the conditions for clearing the scenario?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kill one or more creatures....."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Watching the people in front of me timidly close the distance between us, I took a step forward,</p>
<p class="orv_line">trying to be defiant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Gather a group of humans and ask them to kill a creature, which of course sounds like asking</p>
<p class="orv_line">them to kill each other, but there's a trap in that statement."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What trap?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smirked, watching the big guy who said the same thing over and over again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You could have just told them to kill 'humans'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Their eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then the solution is......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's simple. We just need to find another creature we can kill."</p>
<p class="orv_line">With that, I slammed the vending machine with all my might. Then I pointed to a cockroach that</p>
<p class="orv_line">scurried out from underneath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">People gasped as they realized.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If we all work together, we should be able to collect bugs quickly."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's do it, right now!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's all put down the vending machine!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">People now clung to the vending machine instead of the invisible wall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Their faces became livelier, perhaps because this time they had a sense of reality.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Push!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the vending machine was pushed, a can of soda fell out with the sound of shaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No one took the drink.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"One more time!"</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The vending machine tilted, and soon I heard something break.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The next thing I know, bugs are falling out of the back of the machine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"They're out! Let's catch them!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shouted to the rushing people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you catch a bug, don't kill it, show it to me first!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What? Why?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued to speak firmly, despite their wary glances.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I need to see if it's carrying eggs."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Eggs?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"An egg might qualify as a life form, so if we find one, we can all live."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah......!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Remember, you have other people's lives in your hands. Only we can save each other."</p>
<p class="orv_line">People glanced back at each other, then took off their shoes and socks and start catching bugs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some people hit the vending machines with their bags or fists, while others grabbed nearby fire</p>
<p class="orv_line">extinguishers and hit it with them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even the big guy who had been giving me a hard time joined in and kicked a vending machine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reader ahjussi —the one who's daughter likes Kim Dokja— slowly came to my side and</p>
<p class="orv_line">asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What about you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm fine."</p>
<p class="orv_line">We watched the bustling crowd.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wiping blood from the corner of his mouth, the reader ahjussi said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You decided to save them all."</p>
<p class="orv_line">People scrambling to kill the bugs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This would change the story of Geumho Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Those who were supposed to kill people and survive would kill bugs and survive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe even that big guy who wasn't in the original story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is it because of me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reader ahjussi lowered his head as if feeling guilty.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This will change the course of the entire novel, and we will face a future we don't know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I put my hand lightly on reader ahjussi's shoulder.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't think about it. I was going to do this from the start."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The number of people who caught one, two, and more insects began to increase.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Among them was the deacon, who had already secured his share of bugs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's all thanks to you, brother. Thank you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, it's not."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps this deacon was meant to die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a strange pang of guilt at the thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How many people have died like this in my novel?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Kim Cheolyang' begins to trust you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that I suddenly heard the character's inner thoughts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart started to best fast.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt that something was finally coming.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, I had an exclusive skill.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Character List' has been activated.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Character List.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A skill that allows you to view the information of the characters in 'Omniscient Reader'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a skill that Kim Dokja, the main character of Omniscient Reader, also had.</p>

<p>leader who is recognized by the people, but he has been unable to overcome his natural</p>
<p>personality and he's crouching down.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Character Kim Cheolyang.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought the name sounded familiar, and then I remembered that I had written down a character</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">named Kim Cheolyang at some point.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, it was in one of over 10,000 notes, and I couldn't recall any details since the character</p>
<p class="orv_line">was included in an abandoned setting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, for an extra character, his exclusive attribute is pretty interesting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Crouching Figure.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was originally Jung Heewon who had the Crouching Figure attribute in the original version of</p>
<p class="orv_line">the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Depending on the circumstances, this trait has the potential to put him on the list of the 100</p>
<p class="orv_line">strongest in the world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is he a great unknown character?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Cheolyang, who didn't know what I was thinking, kept talking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's a good thing that this happened during the outdoor evangelism....... and I'm so glad we met</p>
<p class="orv_line">you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Maybe the end of days has finally come, and like brother said, God is watching us."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He's probably watching us pretty hard. Grabbing a handful of popcorn for every head that</p>
<p class="orv_line">explodes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I think we're doing pretty well with your help, though."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Shhh."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I understood why I abandoned this character.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How dare he say 'pretty well'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That line is a trigger in 'Omniscient Reader'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Hoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shit. As expected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Here's another one who's playing tricks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The message was atypical.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A message that used the one-on-one dokkaebi communication instead of the official channels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was an ominous omen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no such development in the main story of 'Omniscient Reader'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Don't make it obvious, just listen. I'm telling you this specifically because it's funny.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I quickly lowered my gaze and pretended nothing happened, Bihyung continued talking</p>
<p class="orv_line">with satisfaction.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">—I see what you're thinking, but you'd better use your judgment. The constellations don't like</p>
<p class="orv_line">incarnations that are too smart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, Bihyung was talking because of his own personal benefit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe they didn't like what I was doing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I laughed bitterly as I looked in the air where Bihyung might be.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What would you, a low level dokkaebi, know? I'm sure I know far better than you what the</p>
<p class="orv_line">constellations like.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Sometimes it's wise not to think too hard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was all Bihyung said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Found it! I found another one!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We're not quite there yet, we've got a lot of people left—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The trash can! Let's look in the trash can, too!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The number of people trapped together was exactly twenty-two.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We needed to secure at least twenty-two bugs for everyone to survive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Found one!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Here, take another one!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were also people who had already caught bugs and were holding them for others. It was a</p>
<p class="orv_line">very moving scene.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was hard to believe that these were the same people who fought for food in the original</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Omniscient Reader'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The big guy picked up a large cockroach from afar and waved at me with a big smile on his face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey, is this one okay? It's a living thing too, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There are 21 minutes remaining.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The bustling crowd slowed down noticeably.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I turned to them and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is there anyone who hasn't caught a bug yet?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">No one raised their hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Twenty-two bugs, to be exact. That was the same number of people trapped here. It was a clean</p>
<p class="orv_line">sweep, the best possible result, without having to search for bug eggs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey, can we kill it now?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If we kill it, can we get out of here?"</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Relief washed over their faces.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The pleasure that we had survived together without harming anyone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After carefully checking everyone's hands for a bug, I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Brothers and sisters, let's thank our insect brothers for their sacrifice!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">With the deacon's declaration, several people clapped their hands and slapped down the bugs</p>
<p class="orv_line">they held.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When the tension eased a bit, some people asked silly questions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Can I step on it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You don't have to kill it with your hands, do you? You just have to kill it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I told them they could kill them any way they wanted, they started stomping on the bugs</p>
<p class="orv_line">like dirty children.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Squish!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Similar sounds echoed around the room.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even the big guy, who had torn off all the bugs' legs afraid that it would escape, crushed it with</p>
<p class="orv_line">his feet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Die! Die!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened the pocket that held the bug. The dead bug was there, along with some thick body</p>
<p class="orv_line">fluids. I must have squeezed it too tightly earlier when I tried to save the ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could hear the crowd cheering.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is it okay now?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was a little worried about the change of the development at Geumho Station, but as I looked at</p>
<p class="orv_line">the reader ahjussi's faintly smiling face, I realized that it was okay.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe now the people of Geumho Station will be able to live a completely different life from the</p>
<p class="orv_line">one I wrote.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Nothing happened, are you sure it's over?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone asked anxiously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Has anything changed?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">People looked at each other and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This thing is dead, right? It's it tough because it's a bug?"</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The big guy who had been trampling the bug in the corner questioned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know how many times he trampled on it because the giant bug was crushed by the sole of</p>
<p class="orv_line">his sneakers and I couldn't find any trace of it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought back to the first scenario of 'Omniscient Reader' and suddenly realized an eerie fact.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I turned to the reader ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you get the system message after you killed the bug earlier?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yeah. The scenario is cleared......"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pulled out the dead bug from my pocket.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A bug that I couldn't tell when it died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A chill ran down my spine.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I didn't receive any system messages. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Author's Note</p>
<p class="orv_line">Turn it off and on again.</p>
