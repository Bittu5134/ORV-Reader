<p class="orv_line">At first, of course I thought it was a joke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Hit Yoo Jonghyuk in the back of the head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because no sane person would make such a suggestion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Then I will help you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, seriously?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Because I miss it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why do you want to see that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a difficult question to ask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I guess he said he wanted to see it because it was fun. The 'Demon King of Salvation' is a constellation after all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, before he was a constellation, that person actually liked hitting Yoo Jonghyuk in the back of the head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not only in the 3rd round, but also in the 1,863rd round, he was a heinous great man who hit Yoo Jonghyuk on the back of the head and made him eat dirt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you think about it, it was a strange thing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did Kim Dokja do such a thing?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is he naturally a bit sadistic?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Why? Can't you do it? Did you ask for help without that much courage?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, being courageous and being crazy are different."</p>
<p class="orv_line">—If you can’t do it, quit. You don't need my help, right?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No! I need it! I need it!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I calmed down and thought about this proposal again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you think about it, Kim Dokja’s actions were thoroughly calculated throughout the scenarios.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From an item picked up during a scenario to a paving stone laid in advance, Kim Dokja was the person who prepared for the very distant future.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That guy told me to hit Yoo Jonghyuk in the back of the head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If so, there must be a reason.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tak!</p>
<p class="orv_line">I believed so. Until I heard a clicking sound from my palm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment my eyes met with Yoo Jonghyuk’s, who slowly turned his head. I realized what I had done.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A terrifying look that seems to freeze even your heart. Pupils glowing with terrible heat glared at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">First of all, to make the facts clear, I did not properly hit Yoo Jonghyuk in the back of the head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be exact, I just hit the magic barrier between the back of Yoo Jonghyuk's head and my palm.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk'’s skill 'Self-Defense Lv.10' is being activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the seventh scenario, the self-defense level is as high as level 10.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was an opponent on whom an attack from the back of the head would not work.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'What should I do now?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, I kept my promise to Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From now on, it’s up to Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You really did this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Yes?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I didn't know you would really do it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Are you crazy?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lately, another piece of information about Kim Dokja came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Clearly, Kim Dokja plans everything thoroughly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, did this person have a plan when he hit Yoo Jonghyuk?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you doing?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">My spine straightened and my spine went numb. It became clear to me that if this continued, I would die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What on earth have I done?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did I hit Yoo Jonghyuk in the back of the head?</p>
<p class="orv_line">To the guy who already has a grudge against me-</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive characteristics are activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Is it because I was in danger? Suddenly, my head became clear and my mind became clearer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This became clear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Let's live. I have to survive somehow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To Yoo Jonghyuk, I am now Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I were Cheon Inho, what would I say to Yoo Jonghyuk now?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.10' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Equipped with the special Cheon Inho mode, my narrowed eyes twirled in a gentle arc.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Your skill proficiency is amazing. I wouldn’t have been able to stop you in my last life."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk's expression, who had been rolling his eyes at my shameless tone, changed completely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you regain your memories from the last round?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I just shrugged my shoulders without answering. However, Yoo Jonghyuk’s answer was unexpected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Stop acting. I already know that you are not 'Cheon Inho'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swallowed my embarrassment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew that Yoo Jonghyuk was suspicious of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I never thought he would bring that up out loud.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why do you think that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you were really Cheon Inho, you would have aimed for a more obvious vital point."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then let’s use the fake Cheon Inho. After all, who I am doesn't matter, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It wasn’t important. Originally."</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, Yoo Jonghyuk put on his coat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After that, he sat down on a chair and started gulping down the drink on the table. Even as he drank his drink, he did not take his eyes off the clear sky outside the window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see what Yoo Jonghyuk was looking at.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the center of the cloudless sky, there remained traces as if someone had grabbed the space itself and ripped it away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was from the award ceremony 45 days ago, when the 'Great Hall' disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Beyond the sky, me and Yoo Jonghyuk fought Asmodeus, then I faced off against the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Does Yoo Jonghyuk remember what happened that day?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Also.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja, who was watching Yoo Jonghyuk with me, said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—He’s not killing you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was dumbfounded. Did he make me hit the head of Yoo Jonghyuk just to test it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You've learned that he won't kill you anyway. This is important. I don't know how many more times I'm going to have to hit that guy in the back of the head from now on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I won't hit him anymore.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk, who must have sensed my gaze, put down his glass and opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Fake Cheon Inho."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why did you stop me from taking the Absolute Throne?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You took it in the end."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know what you did."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk's whole body slowly looked back at me, showing the power of a king.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that was only a matter of momentum, and it didn't actually have any influence on me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this round, it was proof that the 'Absolute Throne' was not functioning properly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How did you kill the 'God of Another World'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I was lucky."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why on earth did you do that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You will never see a proper ending if you take the throne."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How do you know that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You’re a regressor and you still don’t know that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the meantime, did the 'Demon King of Salvation' Kim Dokja's tone of voice change? Without realizing it, I came up with a sharp answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk’s reaction was clear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk acted as if he was going to kill him this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I started gulping on my saliva without realizing it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Don’t be scared. He won’t kill you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I also agreed with what Kim Dokja said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk can't kill me now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, Yoo Jonghyuk's murderous spirit, who was glaring at me, slowly subsided. Yoo Jonghyuk made his decision.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Rather than killing me here and now. It's better to use me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It's not a very bad situation. You have been recognized by Jonghyuk, right?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Recognized by Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That sounds like I haven't lived very wrongly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't feel bad inside.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk continued speaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That day, there was someone other than you who stopped me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could immediately tell who Yoo Jonghyuk was talking about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was a story about Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"She planted a memory in my head."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What memory?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A memory from another world line."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though it was something I expected, I got goosebumps again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not another Yoo Jonghyuk, but Yoo Jonghyuk of the 41st round learned about the world line of 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was curious about Kim Dokja's reaction, but he didn’t say anything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you know that world line too?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I do."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I became curious for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How does Yoo Jonghyuk in the 41st round view the world of 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What did he feel when he saw the story of that world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Can you do something similar to that woman?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m asking if you can plant the memories of that world line in my head."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Like Han Sooyoung, I did not have the complete story of Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But if I were to simply inject what happened in that world line, I might be able to imitate it similarly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because I have [Incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you turn off [mental barrier], I can do it, however clumsily. Are you curious about the story of that world line?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was worried for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Yoo Jonghyuk says he wants to know that world line, should I tell him the story?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If that happens, what will happen to this 41st round?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m not curious about the story."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk said that and frowned again, I wondered what he was thinking. Then he opened his mouth as if sighing lightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I received a call from Anna Croft a little while ago."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a name I hadn’t heard in a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The representative incarnation of Asgard. She is the representative of the American group.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That woman’s group will join the final battle of the seventh scenario."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You mean Zarathustra?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It seems like you know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, I had used the Specter's Stone to meet Anna Croft.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had a brief conversation with her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you planning to join forces with her?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be honest, I was surprised.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know what happened in the 40th round, but the Yoo Jonghyuk I know was never the type of person to join forces with 'Anna Croft'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, things will change when we enter the later episodes of 'Ways of Survival', but this is only the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk, who has not forgotten any of the tragedy that occurred in the last round... will he be able to cooperate with that 'Anna Croft'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If I ever meet Anna Croft, I’ll probably kill her."</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, a strange sensation arose throughout Yoo Jonhyuk's body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a sense of an unsettling story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, Kim Dokja’s voice was heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Damn, that kid got that tattooed on his body in only the seventh scenario?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja seemed to recognize what Yoo Jonghyuk's story was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Anna Croft is still useful. She has work to do, at least until the world ends. So if I'm going to kill her..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk took a slow breath as if to calm himself down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You should stop it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Infuse me with memories of another world line."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What… if I do something like that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then I can stop."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goosebumps slowly appeared down my spine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did I start to understand why Yoo Jonghyuk kept me alive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don’t really know why, but when I receive these memories, I stop acting."</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Happy memories. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I don’t know what happened to Yoo Jonghyuk’s inner self after receiving his memories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Yoo Jonghyuk was speaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don’t know if you are Cheon Inho or not. But you will stay next to me and stop me when I give you an order."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Stop him when he orders me to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That’s your usefulness."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I understood what Yoo Jonghyuk meant. That's why I couldn't believe it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Congratulations, youngest. Looks like this is going to work out well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just now, I was officially recognized by Yoo Jonghyuk of the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This is an order. Join this scenario."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Become his companion to prevent the destruction of this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Constellation.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Huh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment when the first ray of light shone in the 41st world, which was filled with all kinds of gloomy prospects.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it is not too late for the 41st round. This story can still be changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, Kim Dokja spoke in an even more excited voice as if he was moved.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Next time you hit him in the back of the head, let’s inject a memory where I made him eat dirt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I ignored Kim Dokja’s nonsense and checked my smartphone. That was because a vibration rang at that moment.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new episode of 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' has been updated on the platform.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And then I realized I had forgotten I had this ability.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ability to check 'comments' on episodes posted on the platform. If I used this ability, not only what happened in the last 45 days. I may also be able to get hints about future events.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With that in mind, I clicked on the platform app… How did this happen?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The series from the last 45 days in which I fainted did not exist.</p>
