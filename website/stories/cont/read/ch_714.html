<p class="orv_line">As my vision narrowed, I realized what was about to happen.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The Demon King of Salvation wants to sacrifice himself. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The situation is desperate. The Washington Dome was under siege by great-grade constellations, and there was no constellation to help us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To make matters worse, he was sentenced by [fate].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja made a decision in a situation where death was inevitable no matter what he did.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only through his death can this obstacle be overcome.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Stop!’</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I couldn't leave it like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is my [fate]. It's my share to bear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Stop!'</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is no reason why the Demon King of Salvation should receive it instead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Kim Dokja!'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You're not ready to fight them yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like someone was supporting me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I turned my head and saw Christina Page.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as I was about to say thank you, my eyes met hers with a faint hint of guilt. Her fingers moved with an ominous foreboding.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My vision went dark.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Christina Page.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft's closest associate who leads 'Zarathustra'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She is an FBI forensic hypnosis expert and is called 'Finger Snapper' in 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just before she possessed this character, Olivia was playing TRPG with her friends.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Kevin, Jim, Amelia.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Olivia thought about her own friends.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She had friends who liked subculture.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kevin only read webtoons with 'SSS' in the title.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jim loved martial arts novels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Amelia loved virtual idols.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' was a Korean web novel brought by Kevin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Guys, how are we supposed to survive once we enter this novel?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Oh, Kevin. It's starting again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—This is set in Korea. I think we'll be at a bit of a disadvantage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—No, America is also included.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Kevin, but the title of this novel doesn’t include 'SSS'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">ㅡ As you read, SSS appears. Olivia, can you write an email to the author? You said before that you have a Korean friend. Let's add this novel's world view in the next session.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What would it have been like if she hadn't listened to Kevin at that time?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If she hadn't sent the email to the author, all of this wouldn't have happened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Oh my God.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was sheer luck that she survived.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It turns out that the person who she possessed was 'Christina Page'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She has always enjoyed playing TRPGs, so it wasn't difficult for her to play the role of 'Christina Page'. She was glad the task wasn't difficult.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Olivia was able to forget who she was, at least while she was playing 'Christina Page' .</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She could forget Kevin, forget herself, forget Amelia, forget her dead friends.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Can you really save my friends?</p>
<p class="orv_line">A message from the 'Demon King of Salvation' delivered through the exclusive skill, [Nightmare].</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Yes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If she grants his request, he will definitely save her dead friends.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the request is—</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Daily Invoice Lv.5' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Christina hurriedly helped Cheon Inho, who fell in front of her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was startled to see Anna Croft stumbling in the distance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Christina! What are you doing?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It is the order of the Demon King of Salvation."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He told me to place a [Daily Invoice] on his incarnation."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What the hell is that—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">She doesn't know why the Demon King of Salvation made such a request.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It doesn’t matter. This person can ignore my [daily invoice] and move his incarnation."</p>
<p class="orv_line">She doesn't know, but she thought they were planning to use [Daily Invoice] to fight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The strange thing is why he communicated directly through [Nightmare] rather than using his incarnation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then why doesn’t Cheon Inho wake up? Last time he woke up right away."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know that too—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that a bright beam of light burst from the Capitol.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was the area where the 'sub-scenario' occurred earlier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The place where the fake 'Demon King of Salvation' and the ‘black beast’ appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the false Demon King of Salvation was defeated, and Yoo Jonghyuk, who became the Black Beast, also fainted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The scenario has already ended.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But why are sparks flying around the Capitol?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Christina. The cost is incorrect."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dark clouds filled the sky and covered the Capitol.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A pitch-black thunderbolt falling between dark clouds.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Demon King of Salvation' is resurrected in the scenario.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The demon king, who was thought to be dead, appeared in Washington.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Dark Keeper', hugged in the warm abyss, thought.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A question that has been asked for a very long time.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Who am I? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That moon gate was all that explained him. The answer he couldn't get even though he gave up all his resources.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order to find it, the 'Dark Keeper' contracted with the dokkaebi and became part of the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless,</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I was not the Demon King of Salvation. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He couldn't find the answer he wanted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There couldn't be an exact answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The stars turned away from him and the script abandoned him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is just a nameless character.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Or a monster that didn't even become a character. A consumable to make the main character shine.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 That’s fine. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He already knew that this world was a playground for constellations. Even if it was just a sand castle that was built for a short time on the playground and then collapsed, he wanted to have his own name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He wanted to be a proper part of the playground.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He wanted to become the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Do you really want to become the 'Demon King of Salvation'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Dark Keeper' looked up blankly at the Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Whatever the cost?</p>
<p class="orv_line">He wants to have a name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He wants to have a proper role and die after fulfilling it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Dark Keeper' nodded with all his might.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He's good even if it's just one sentence, so if there's a story given to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Then let’s give it a try.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He wants to write down that story.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Demon King of Salvation' begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The cold snow covered him.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The dark sentinel soon became one with distant eternity.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 We are the Demon King of salvation. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">His tattered body was once again filled with probability and filled with the story of the constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the midst of wild sparks, Kim Dokja, the 'Demon King of Salvation', opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When he lightly tilted his head, his body screamed along with a crunching sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A demonic body full of traces of being cut to pieces by Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though no limb was intact, it was important that the plan was successful.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of &lt;Asgard&gt; are astonished!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A plan that was dramatically successful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This could not have been realized if several probabilities had not been interlocked like cogs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A giant nebula uttered [fate].</p>
<p class="orv_line">That [fate] was given to him, a narrative-grade constellation, instead of an incarnation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The probability ran wild due to a calculation error in the twisted [fate]. </p>
<p class="orv_line">Under the pretext of extra probability, he was given the right to move to a new body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Above all, the plan could not have succeeded if it had not been for the help of the demon 'Dark Keeper' who impersonated the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The incarnation body is quiet with your story.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The synchronization rate between you and the incarnation body increases.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps this will be his last story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s him! He’s over there!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations who sensed his status began to flock to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The great constellations belonging to the giant nebula that were chasing Lee Hakhyun just a moment ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"W-what is that—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why in a body other than your own incarnation..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Could it be that you were trying to protect the incarnation?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations looked at each other in disbelief.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone said with a sly smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"They say he’s a fragment of a discarded god, but he’s incredibly stupid."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Stupid.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was correct.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the nebula &lt;Ghost&gt; shake their heads at your foolishness.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the nebula &lt;Guardian Tree&gt; are saddened by your choice.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the nebula &lt;Olympus&gt; laugh at your judgment.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The body of the resurrected demon species creaked. The word was resurrection, but the body was already dead. An incarnation that can't last even 10 minutes at best.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From afar, the 'Gatekeeper of Thebes' shouted loudly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You've finally been caught, Demon King of Salvation! There's nowhere to run now!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if victory had already been achieved, the 'Gatekeeper of Thebes' walked towards him with great strides and spoke in a triumphant voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You have no idea how much effort I put into catching you. I persuaded the nebulae one by one…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that [fate] has been declared, it will be difficult to avoid death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The situation might have been a little better if there had been a story like 'I, the Opponent of Fate', and Cheok Junkyung’s 'The One Who Fights Against Fate', which the 1,865th round of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; had.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was no such story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were many stories that he does not have today.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Maybe the youngest will find everything. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The youngest was a strange guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Among the 'Kim Dokjas' he knows, he is the only one who can write.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was curious at first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was curious about what the guy who possessed this petty villain would talk about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy who clumsily imitated 'Kim Dokja' was cute, and he was a little proud of the guy who took care of the things that 'Kim Dokja' didn’t do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sometimes he was so frustrated that he wanted to say something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, it was fun to see the story of such a guy.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 But he’s the youngest. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe that's why he's here now.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 This damned world won’t read the story you wrote. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Gatekeeper of Thebes', who had been talking for a while, frowned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…So, are you listening to my story?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation looked at him for a moment and laughed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Among the tales of the 'Gatekeeper of Thebes', there was the 'final cubic crystal'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A tale that makes one confess one's desires at the last moment in exchange for raising one's status.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uh, go ahead."</p>
<p class="orv_line">While the 'Gatekeeper of Thebes' was talking, the Demon King of Salvation looked through the coat the demon servant was wearing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a cigarette pack in the coat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As he took out a cigarette, the idea of a guy who liked cigarettes came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who was it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Memories dispersed like smoke. The place where the memories disappeared hurt. That pain immediately proved that he was Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Gatekeeper of Thebes', who came to his senses belatedly, blushed and shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kill him! Retrieve the fragment!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Incarnations rushing towards him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation said, tossing away his cigarette.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Youngest, let me borrow some weapons."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Silver light flew from somewhere and settled in the right hand of the Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The tale 'The One Who is Loved by All Things' begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The item 'Thoughts of Almost Everything' is suitable for your story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In a flash of bright light, one of the incarnations that was running at the front was split in half.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kaaaaaaak!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Thoughts' mimicked 'Broken Faith'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I activate 'Blade of Faith'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How can you still—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations retreated in awe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The power to kill the incarnation of a great constellation with increased synchronization.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Gatekeeper of Thebes', with his eyes wide open as if torn apart, screamed loudly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s just a fluke! Keep pushing! Even he’s at his limit!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The hesitating constellations rushed forward again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation swung his sword without hesitation. Cut off their arms, cut off their legs, and slit their throat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Every time that happened, the wounds on the demon species' body also increased.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 This world is an obvious tragedy. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He pulled out the arrow stuck in his shoulder and kicked away the spear that grazed his thigh.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 A world created to cause pain to Yoo Jonghyuk. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment he removed the blade aimed at his side, a pain arose in his back. The torn wings of the demon species fluttered across the floor.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 A story marred by big and small failures and never-ending despair. This world was the fate given to Yoo Jonghyuk. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the torn wing fell to the ground, lightning struck again from the sky.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Therefore, anyone who tries to share that responsibility will surely be cursed. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The void curtain fluttered and another star fell into the white shining night sky.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some great fate is wishing for your death.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He is the Demon King of Salvation who cannot feel emotions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, at this moment, he was also Kim Dokja. Maybe it was because I met the youngest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Okay. Are you fighting too?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk couldn’t answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as the writing on the monitor does not respond.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some communication never happens. And where communication is impossible, there is just a story.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The Demon King of Salvation lives to read that story. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation smiled like a prisoner accepting a deserved punishment.</p>
