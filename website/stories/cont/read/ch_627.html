<p class="orv_line">"I am."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't answer right away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Obviously, I wasn't that 'Cheon Inho'. Their way of thinking was different, and their likes and dislikes were different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Their soul was different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But can I really say that I have nothing to do with that 'Cheon Inho'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I possessed his body, and before I possessed it, I wrote a sentence about him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I made 'Cheon Inho' with my own hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if Han Sooyoung wrote the first draft, I had plenty of opportunities to change the sentences.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If so, maybe I—</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You are a different person."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon frowned as if she didn't understand why I was taking so long.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No matter how you look at it, you're a different person. I also saw that world. You have different personalities, and you look closely... Cheon Inho here is more attractive."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't figure out what the hell she was talking about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi said, 'Another world'. Then, isn't it a world that doesn't exist on this side? It's like a world in a novel."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A world of fiction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The reason I asked is because I just wanted to hear a set answer. That's all. So tell me. Inho-ssi, are you the same person as Cheon Inho in that world?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly came to my senses.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The hand that Jung Heewon reached out to first. If I didn't hold this hand, that wasn't polite either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm not like him. At least I think so."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">But is that really enough?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will she be able to understand and move on with that alone?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The Cheon Inho I believe in is only the Cheon Inho in front of me right now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if [inciting] herself, Jung Heewon said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"So Inho-ssi too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who came towards me, said while putting the blade on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Think of the me in front of you right now as Jung Heewon. Except for Jung Heewon from 'The Future You Know'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did I know why she brought up this topic.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The Jung Heewon in front of me is not the Jung Heewon of 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who was the sword of Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who killed Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, the only incarnation of the Demon-like Judge of Fire and the guardian of <Kim Dokja’s Company>.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That Jung Heewon is not here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I am not 'Cheon Inho', she is also in the stories of the apostles.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She is not that 'Jung Heewon'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There is only one Jung Heewon in the 41st turn.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I sincerely nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon smiled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If I fall off a bridge again, will you save me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A few times."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon sighed lightly, bent down to pick up her sword from the floor, and lightly tilted her head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I said something too complicated, not like me. Actually, I don't want to think difficult things right now. I like simple things."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Certainly, the Jung Heewon I knew wasn't one to talk about things like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I just want to cut, stab, and somehow survive. That's all I want to do."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's enough for now. Instead, please do it by my side."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At those words, Jung Heewon lifted her head at a subtle angle and looked at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I could stab Inho-ssi by mistake?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then I'll die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon thought it was a joke and laughed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That can't be done. Inho-ssi, please come so that I don't stab the wrong person."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Of course. By the way."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I slowly looked around the restaurant, I asked a question I had been wanting to ask all along.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Haven't you already stabbed one?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was only one other person in the restaurant besides us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be precise, at Jung Heewon’s feet.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The man was still breathing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was a man whose peculiarities were hard to find except that he was pretending to be homeless.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well, even that is a feature that has little meaning at this point when everyone is homeless.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The sniper you just caught? Was there a real sniper?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There is."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man, whose whole body was tightly bound, let out intermittent moans as if he were trying to detach himself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even though the gun was a toy gun."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I checked [character list].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although he didn't have any particularly great stats or characteristics, there was one skill that stood out.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Strengthen bullets.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A skill that changes toy bullets into power comparable to normal bullets. It seemed that he was targeting us with this skill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After hitting the man on the cheek several times, the man who suddenly came to his senses began crying and begging her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sa-save me! Please!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Which group do you belong to?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slammed the pot on the floor next to the man's head and asked. After all, this guy is the one who tried to shoot on us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was wondering if I should pretend to torture him, but the man shouted in a fit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Damn, Beggar! Beggar Sect!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">He spit it out easier than I thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way... Beggars?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked if she had read my expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A group you know?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I subtly nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is probably no web novelist who is unaware of the concept of the Beggar Sect.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because it is the name of the Bangpa that appears regularly in martial arts novels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Beggar Sect was a place that represented 'one of the old sects' in Murim.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That is to say, if it was set at a normal time, it was like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If there's a problem, I know that the 'Beggar Sect' doesn't come out in Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Where are your headquarters?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That, that's..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who was by his side, picked up a knife.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Above, the location! It's hard to tell because it's so wide, but the main base is on the Seoul Station side!</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who is the head of the group?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s Cheongae!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Opening, Cheongae, Seoul Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first two were never described in detail even when reading the book, but it was different for Seoul Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to my memory, it is because Kim Dokja once monologued as follows.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Still, that's cute enough. Compared to those in Chungmuro or Seoul Station.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That was the only description of 'Seoul Station' I read in all of the novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tried to think of other notes, but nothing particularly came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because the vicinity of Seoul Station was only mentioned, but no specific framework was established.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, it means that Han Sooyoung did not convey it to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why were you spying on us?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Chew, the commander told me to keep an eye on the road to expand our power. That's really all. I didn't mean to hurt you!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at his expression, I thought it was real. After thinking for a while, I suddenly looked down at the man's waist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Three knots hanging from the waist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Look at this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the knot, I pondered and asked the man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Can you specify?"</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The man could only be released from us after repeated [oaths of existence].</p>
<p class="orv_line">The specifications were simple.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「About us, don't report it to the representative no matter what.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The leaving man kept bowing his head this way and repeating his thanks.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently, a number of targets have contracted the 'Oath of Existence’.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[As the number of targets of the 'Existence Specification' increases, the power of the 'Oath' weakens.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This is another penalty I didn't know about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe that's why they didn't make the 'Oath to Existence' often in the main story?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who watched him walk away, asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Can we let him live?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is startled by your behavior.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you think my judgment is wrong?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I just think it's Inho-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There is a reason I saved him."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps that group has already obtained permission for [group chat].</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, there was a high possibility that the man did not give information to nearby group members the moment he was caught by Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, in some way, the information has already been passed on to the other group.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's not an ordinary group. The hierarchy within the organization has already been established."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A hierarchy?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I explained about the knot tied around the man's waist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Originally, the group called 'Beggars Sect' is the group of 'beggars' in martial arts novels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unusually, they reveal their rank with a 'knot' on their waist. For example, regular members have one 'knot'. Buntaju-class knot 'three'. Dangju’s level is the same as 'five'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That person had three knots. That means he's on the Buntaju level."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What is Buntaju?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That… In terms of a company, you can roughly think of it as an assistant manager or a manager."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Isn't it high?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, but it is important that there is a rank."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As far as I know, there are up to nine open knots in total.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just now, since that guy was in the middle ranks, it means that there are six more levels above him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's only in the early stages of the scenario, but it was truly surprising that they had already created a group of that size.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is this a group created by people who like martial arts novels?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It could be that way, or-"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It could be that the constellation is related to Murim.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Either way, it was an opponent that could not be good because we were now hostile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Above all, 'Kim Dokja' had a group comparable to Chungmuro, so it must be judged that they have at least ten medicines.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, this side has Jung Heewon, but Jung Heewon's real skills are displayed when dealing with monsters rather than people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What if he brings a gang? He said he swore, but you never know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It'll be all right if he comes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">If they still come to attack us, then it is a war with clear intentions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"At that time, you'll be free to kill them."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if I had made a great remark, but Jung Heewon smiled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I like that."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Somehow, it felt like a very bloody duo was created.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I replied with a wry smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then let’s set off. Did you say Yoo Jonghyuk went north?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, there’s one thing I didn’t tell you about earlier," Jung Heewon added, scratching her cheek.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That person, Yoo Jonghyuk, said one more word before he left."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it might be. Yoo Jonghyuk looks cool on the outside, but he is secretly a guy with a lot of lingering feelings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The current Cheon Inho cannot be recognized as Cheon Inho. But-"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If we recruit a person as a colleague, he says he will think about recognizing you as 'Cheon Inho'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's not about acknowledging me, thinking about acknowledging me is also good.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The mad butcher... he said you would understand."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A mad butcher?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A sentence came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, there was one incarnation with such a nickname.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>["One of the 100 strongest people in Ways of Survival, the 'Mad Butcher', eventually evolved from the 'Crouching Figure'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Surprisingly, however, this person was only mentioned once and passed by. After that, it is not even mentioned whether he is dead or alive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's the 100 strongest people in Ways of Survival...</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, Han Sooyoung didn't tell me this, so there's probably no mention of it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, Yoo Jonghyuk is looking for that mad butcher...</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story turns out in a fun way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Anyone you know?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's what I've heard of."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as I was about to say, "I don't know him," I felt a slight pain in my head once again.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new skill is active]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">New skill?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「'Mad Butcher' was born at 'Seoul Station' that day.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A thought that came to my mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since when was it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goosebumps slowly formed on my forearms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't a sentence that I came up with in particular, nor was it a sentence that originally came out in 'Omniscient Reader'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't even a setting I made, and it wasn't a sentence I would write in the future.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill, 'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World' is active.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That is the story that Kim Dokja loved more than anyone else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a sentence of 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
