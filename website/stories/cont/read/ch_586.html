<p class="orv_line">Demon-Like Judge of Fire.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was momentarily overcome with nostalgia at the sight of a modifier I hadn't seen in such a long</p>
<p class="orv_line">time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Archangel Uriel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One of the '4 main constellations' of Bihyung's channel, along with Prisoner of the Golden</p>
<p class="orv_line">Headband, Abyssal Black Flame Dragon, and Secretive Plotter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellation who loved the protagonist, Kim Dokja, more than any other.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire' makes a sour face.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, without Kim Dokja, Uriel, who entered the channel, didn't seem to be interested in the</p>
<p class="orv_line">incarnations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps that was Uriel's original self before she met Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who had seen Uriel's entry message from afar, waved her hand in this direction. I</p>
<p class="orv_line">saw the shape of her mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Hurry up and do something! She's here!'</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's what she seemed to be saying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what could I do?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja was born to be loved by all things, but I'm the Ten Evil Cheon Inho.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even if you suddenly look at me like that, I don't have anything to show you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Would you like to be incited?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.4' is activated!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I am Kim Dokja.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I tried to incite myself to become Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I couldn't feel any change, other than a couple of 'Ways of Survival' settings coming to mind.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking at you with strange eyes.]</p></div>

<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I looked around and saw Dansoo ahjussi resting on the platform, probably tired from</p>
<p class="orv_line">his kendo practice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Mate."</p>
<p class="orv_line">For some reason, his expression was strangely dark.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, I'm fine, but......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He stuttered, but by this point, I knew without him saying anything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I'm sure he was thinking about Jiyoon again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi smiled weakly at me and muttered as if speaking to himself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If only I liked stories that were a little less dangerous."</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart suddenly felt heavy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We sat side by side and stared into the darkness of the platform.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did your daughter always like novels?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"She read them occasionally, but she especially liked this story."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What did she like about this story?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi looked as serious as Yoo Joonghyuk thinking about regressing, and then answered in a</p>
<p class="orv_line">serious voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Probably that there are a lot of handsome characters."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"My daughter once told me. She said it's good that those handsome companions save each other</p>
<p class="orv_line">all the time."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I ran out of things to say and stared blankly into the darkness of the tunnel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's a pretty good summary.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is curious about what you are talking about.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I could hear the people gathered on the platform laughing raucously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi spoke after a pause.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I hope Jiyoon has friends like those...... by her side now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm sure she does."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Probably, no amount of consolation would reach him now.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, Dansoo ahjussi smiled faintly, gladly accepting my poor consolation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's a relief I met Inho-ssi. If you hadn't saved me back then, I would have been dead already."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's not true."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi was the first reader I'd met, and maybe that's why I wanted him to meet his</p>
<p class="orv_line">daughter and return to reality safely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I dusted myself off and stood up, extending my hand toward him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll do my best to save you until you meet your daughter."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi, who clasped my hand and stood up, nodded and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. I'll do my best to help you too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Seeing his warm smile, I felt my heart warm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The next moment, I heard a message.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked up into the air and thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">......Why did she sponsor me?</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Just before leaving the station, we said goodbye to everyone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo, who came to see us off, was the first to speak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hyung-nim. Are you leaving?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Isn't it dangerous? It's better to see how things go from here and move together......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I have to go. Do you remember everything I told you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'food acquisition' scenario only gave 500 coins, which would only last five days if you paid</p>
<p class="orv_line">your daily survival fee.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you want to escape the survival fee penalty, you'll have to move eventually. Finish the sub</p>
<p class="orv_line">scenario as soon as you can, and get the people to Chungmuro. I'll take care of the monsters on</p>
<p class="orv_line">the way."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hyung-nim......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The members of the Cheoldoo Group bowed their heads towards me. I felt like I really was the</p>
<p class="orv_line">boss of the organization.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo spoke up.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">"To be honest, I was suspicious of you at first."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You know, there's such a thing as people-watching. You looked a little cowardly, and had an</p>
<p class="orv_line">annoying smile."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I still don't fully trust you. I've been living in this world for a long time, so I don't trust people."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo, unlike himself, rambled for a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Still, watching you, I reflected on myself a bit. On what a person is. You shouldn't judge a</p>
<p class="orv_line">person by what they look like......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was about to punch him in the head, but then I stopped. Don't judge a book by its cover.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if I deserved to hear that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, I had judged Bang Cheolsoo based on a few lines in his 'Omniscient Reader'. Then I</p>
<p class="orv_line">suddenly had a strange thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How much truth does Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint contain?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Okay. I'll see you again, so don't talk too much."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' admires your noir vibe!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[100 coins have been sponsored.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"And this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"And this......?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's the Magic Power Stove we used earlier. You take care of it and use it to cook."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Magic Power Stove', the only cooking utensil here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo quickly understood what I meant by giving it to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"H-Hyung-nim......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I turned my back on them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi had finished greeting the people and quickly joined me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Take care, hyung-nim!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">We walked through the chorus of the Cheoldoo Group and entered the Yaksu Station tunnel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What a bittersweet feeling."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi kept looking back. Perhaps he had already gotten attached to the people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who kept looking back at him, called out to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey, Inho-ssi. By the way......."</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I knew what she was going to say, so I simply replied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"She'll be here soon."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then I heard the sound of someone running after us. I didn't have to turn around to know who it</p>
<p class="orv_line">was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I knew you'd come."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I turned around to see Jung Heewon standing there, pouting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why didn't you ask me if I wanted to come with you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead of answering, I scanned our group. Two scrawny men, one girl with only a muscular</p>
<p class="orv_line">soul.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon sighed heavily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Whatever, really."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's not for free."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon hesitated, then added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You seem like a smart guy, Inho-ssi, so I'm just trying to get some benefit by hanging out with</p>
<p class="orv_line">you for a while."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you looking at?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Nothing, I'm just a little moved."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What moved......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon pursed her lips as she unnecessarily looked ahead, and for some reason, Kyung</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sein looked at me with envy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi was walking a couple of steps away, looking at us with a heartwarming smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon glanced over and asked as if the atmosphere was uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"By the way, where are we going?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard that question, I suddenly had a question.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「How far can we really go?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The darkness beyond the tunnel looked like a pitch black snowfield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What's beyond, only Kim Dokja, who will read the whole story, knows.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"For now, let's go to Chungmuro."</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">It was time to meet the second member of &lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt;.</p>
<hr>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Main Scenario #2 - Meeting&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Main</p>
<p>Difficulty: E</p>
<p>Clear Conditions: Cross the tunnel and meet the survivors in the first main base.</p>
<p>Time Limit: None</p>
<p>Reward: 500 coins</p>
<p>Failure: ???</p>
</div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The next 'main base' is 'Chungmuro'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">About halfway through the tunnel, a new scenario window popped up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The second scenario had finally begun in earnest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We moved forward, lightly dealing with the occasional ground rats, and soon arrived at our first</p>
<p class="orv_line">stop, Yaksu Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't think there are any survivors here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as it had been on the 3rd turn, Yaksu Station was empty in this turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the center of the platform, there were traces of people's bodies that were collected and burned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ugh, here......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Through the scattered ashes and bits of clothing, I could see the words someone had written on</p>
<p class="orv_line">the ground with charcoal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I miss my mom and dad.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein whispered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There wasn't anything like this in Omniscient Reader, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it was left here by a reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi stared at the words for an unusually long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a quick check of the area, Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's all empty."</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's go straight to Dongdae Station, we'll rest there."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Okay."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon took the lead, and we started moving again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein whispered in a low voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi, Dongdae Station...... You remember that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">After about thirty or forty minutes of walking, we finally arrived at the Dongdaemun platform.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no sign of life here either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps because we had traveled through the two stops at a much faster pace than the original,</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was a little tired.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This is harder than I thought."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was no wonder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While passing through the two stations, she had single-handedly killed one hundred and fifty</p>
<p class="orv_line">ground rats.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is interested in the incarnation 'Jung Heewon'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This level of combat power without the [Judgement Time] was phenomenal. At this level, aside</p>
<p class="orv_line">from Yoo Joonghyuk, there shouldn't be any incarnation that could defeat her now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll take a break. I'll meet you here in 20 minutes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is the toilet water still —available? I'm just going to wash my face. Do you want to come with</p>
<p class="orv_line">me, Sein?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein shook her head in surprise. Jung Heewon nodded slightly and headed straight to the</p>
<p class="orv_line">bathroom.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"See you later, then."</p>
<p class="orv_line">After she disappeared, Kyung Sein and I glanced at each other.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"10 minutes should be enough, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"5 minutes will do."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is intrigued by your plan.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Only Dansoo ahjussi, who had forgotten most of Omniscient Reader, looked puzzled, unable to</p>
<p class="orv_line">understand our conversation.</p>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">A few moments later, we stood in front of Exit 6 of Dongdae Station.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have been exposed to a poisonous fog.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">We poured the 'poisonous rhinoceros horn powder' that remained after treating Killer King into</p>
<p class="orv_line">our mouths, and ran straight up the escalator leading to Dongdaemun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There it is!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein was the first to spot our destination.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A bronze colored statue in the distance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi exclaimed as he realized.</p>
<p class="orv_line">惟政四溟大師像</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yujeong Samyeongdang.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was unmistakable. It was the statue of Samyeongdang, whose modifier was 'Bald General of</p>
<p class="orv_line">Justice' in the original story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Here, Kim Dokja smashed this statue to get a hidden skill and an item.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"As expected, someone has already smashed it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the statue we found was already broken.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation wearing a straw mat glares at you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' chuckles at your misfortune.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled bitterly at the statue that had been cut exactly in half.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know who did it, but they cut it in half so neatly. Judging from the workmanship, it could</p>
<p class="orv_line">be Yoo Joonghyuk, or it could be Killer King or some other reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The pale-faced Kyung Sein called out to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I was expecting it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">We weren't the only readers in this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were people who had gone through a much more difficult 'ichthyosaur scenario' than mine,</p>
<p class="orv_line">people who couldn't get the 'Broken Faith' because of the queue, and people who had even had</p>
<p class="orv_line">So, naturally, I expected that someone would have preempted Samyeongdang's items.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly lifted the upper half of the statue from the ground.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation wearing a straw mat is puzzled by your actions.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Still, with my level 20 strength, I could easily lift a weight that I normally wouldn't have been</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">able to.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' has realized your actions and it's surprised.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I pointed to the other side of the statue and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sein-ssi, could you please hold that for me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein hesitantly approached.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"L-Like this?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. Lift it up to the top of your head like this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll try. Hop."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Together, we lifted the upper half of Samyeongdang's body above our heads.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While doing the scenario for a few days, I realized something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">You will never survive in this world by performing scenarios in the exact same way as in</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Omniscient Reader'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Dansoo ahjussi, get up on the stone and balance it!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a few minutes of struggle, we succeeded in barely placing Samyeongdang's upper half on</p>
<p class="orv_line">top of his lower half.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I cut off the clothes I'd brought in advance from Geumho Station and tied them tightly around the</p>
<p class="orv_line">cracked area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There you go."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The statue looked like it had a bandage around its waist, but it still didn't look too bad.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein's mouth dropped open as she realized my intentions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi, this can't be......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, that's right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">This world is the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A world where everything is a story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">You don't have to beat something up and break it to make a good story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smirked, looked at the two of them, and gave a short salute to the statue.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is deeply moved by your heart!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As I looked up, I saw something shiny fall from the sky.</p>
