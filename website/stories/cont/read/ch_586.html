<p class="orv_line">He stuttered, but by this point, I knew without him saying anything.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I'm sure he was thinking about Jiyoon again.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi smiled weakly at me and muttered as if speaking to himself.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"If only I liked stories that were a little less dangerous."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">My heart suddenly felt heavy.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">We sat side by side and stared into the darkness of the platform.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Did your daughter always like novels?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"She read them occasionally, but she especially liked this story."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What did she like about this story?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"That's......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi looked as serious as Yoo Joonghyuk thinking about regressing, and then answered in a</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">serious voice.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Probably that there are a lot of handsome characters."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"My daughter once told me. She said it's good that those handsome companions save each other</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">all the time."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I ran out of things to say and stared blankly into the darkness of the tunnel.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">That's a pretty good summary.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is curious about what you are talking about.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I could hear the people gathered on the platform laughing raucously.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi spoke after a pause.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I hope Jiyoon has friends like those...... by her side now."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm sure she does."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Probably, no amount of consolation would reach him now.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, Dansoo ahjussi smiled faintly, gladly accepting my poor consolation.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's a relief I met Inho-ssi. If you hadn't saved me back then, I would have been dead already."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"That's not true."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi was the first reader I'd met, and maybe that's why I wanted him to meet his</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">daughter and return to reality safely.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I dusted myself off and stood up, extending my hand toward him.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll do my best to save you until you meet your daughter."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi, who clasped my hand and stood up, nodded and said.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. I'll do my best to help you too."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Seeing his warm smile, I felt my heart warm.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The next moment, I heard a message.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I looked up into the air and thought.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">......Why did she sponsor me?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Just before leaving the station, we said goodbye to everyone.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo, who came to see us off, was the first to speak.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Hyung-nim. Are you leaving?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yeah."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Isn't it dangerous? It's better to see how things go from here and move together......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I have to go. Do you remember everything I told you?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The 'food acquisition' scenario only gave 500 coins, which would only last five days if you paid</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"If you want to escape the survival fee penalty, you'll have to move eventually. Finish the sub</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Hyung-nim......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The members of the Cheoldoo Group bowed their heads towards me. I felt like I really was the</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">boss of the organization.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo spoke up.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"To be honest, I was suspicious of you at first."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What do you mean?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"You know, there's such a thing as people-watching. You looked a little cowardly, and had an</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">annoying smile."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I still don't fully trust you. I've been living in this world for a long time, so I don't trust people."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo, unlike himself, rambled for a long time.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Still, watching you, I reflected on myself a bit. On what a person is. You shouldn't judge a</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">person by what they look like......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I was about to punch him in the head, but then I stopped. Don't judge a book by its cover.......</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if I deserved to hear that.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After all, I had judged Bang Cheolsoo based on a few lines in his 'Omniscient Reader'. Then I</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">suddenly had a strange thought.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">How much truth does Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint contain?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Okay. I'll see you again, so don't talk too much."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' admires your noir vibe!]</p></div>

<p class="orv_line">"And this."</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's the Magic Power Stove we used earlier. You take care of it and use it to cook."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Magic Power Stove', the only cooking utensil here.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo quickly understood what I meant by giving it to him.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"H-Hyung-nim......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I turned my back on them.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi had finished greeting the people and quickly joined me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Take care, hyung-nim!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">We walked through the chorus of the Cheoldoo Group and entered the Yaksu Station tunnel.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What a bittersweet feeling."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi kept looking back. Perhaps he had already gotten attached to the people.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who kept looking back at him, called out to me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey, Inho-ssi. By the way......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I knew what she was going to say, so I simply replied.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"She'll be here soon."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Then I heard the sound of someone running after us. I didn't have to turn around to know who it</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">was.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I knew you'd come."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I turned around to see Jung Heewon standing there, pouting.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Why didn't you ask me if I wanted to come with you?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Instead of answering, I scanned our group. Two scrawny men, one girl with only a muscular</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">soul.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon sighed heavily.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Whatever, really."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's not for free."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon hesitated, then added.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"You seem like a smart guy, Inho-ssi, so I'm just trying to get some benefit by hanging out with</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">you for a while."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you looking at?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Nothing, I'm just a little moved."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What moved......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon pursed her lips as she unnecessarily looked ahead, and for some reason, Kyung</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Sein looked at me with envy.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi was walking a couple of steps away, looking at us with a heartwarming smile.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon glanced over and asked as if the atmosphere was uncomfortable.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"By the way, where are we going?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard that question, I suddenly had a question.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 How far can we really go? 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The darkness beyond the tunnel looked like a pitch black snowfield.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">What's beyond, only Kim Dokja, who will read the whole story, knows.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"For now, let's go to Chungmuro."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was time to meet the second member of &lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt;.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_window">

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">About halfway through the tunnel, a new scenario window popped up.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The second scenario had finally begun in earnest.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">We moved forward, lightly dealing with the occasional ground rats, and soon arrived at our first</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">stop, Yaksu Station.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't think there are any survivors here."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Just as it had been on the 3rd turn, Yaksu Station was empty in this turn.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In the center of the platform, there were traces of people's bodies that were collected and burned.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Ugh, here......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Through the scattered ashes and bits of clothing, I could see the words someone had written on</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">the ground with charcoal.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—I miss my mom and dad.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein whispered.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"There wasn't anything like this in Omniscient Reader, right?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it was left here by a reader.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi stared at the words for an unusually long time.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After a quick check of the area, Jung Heewon.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's all empty."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's go straight to Dongdae Station, we'll rest there."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Okay."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon took the lead, and we started moving again.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein whispered in a low voice.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi, Dongdae Station...... You remember that?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. I know."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After about thirty or forty minutes of walking, we finally arrived at the Dongdaemun platform.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">There was no sign of life here either.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps because we had traveled through the two stops at a much faster pace than the original,</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was a little tired.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"This is harder than I thought."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was no wonder.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">While passing through the two stations, she had single-handedly killed one hundred and fifty</p>

<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein shook her head in surprise. Jung Heewon nodded slightly and headed straight to the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"See you later, then."</p>

<p class="orv_line">Here, Kim Dokja smashed this statue to get a hidden skill and an item.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"As expected, someone has already smashed it."</p>

<p class="orv_line">I smiled bitterly at the statue that had been cut exactly in half.</p>

<p class="orv_line">I don't know who did it, but they cut it in half so neatly. Judging from the workmanship, it could</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi."</p>

<p class="orv_line">"I was expecting it."</p>
<br>

<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">We weren't the only readers in this world.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">So, naturally, I expected that someone would have preempted Samyeongdang's items.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. Lift it up to the top of your head like this."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll try. Hop."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Together, we lifted the upper half of Samyeongdang's body above our heads.</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After a few minutes of struggle, we succeeded in barely placing Samyeongdang's upper half on</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">top of his lower half.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I cut off the clothes I'd brought in advance from Geumho Station and tied them tightly around the</p>
