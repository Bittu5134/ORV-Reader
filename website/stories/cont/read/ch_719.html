            <div class="orv_title"><h1>719 Episode 27 Recycling Center (2)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">The place I fell into was a dense forest area.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Enter the eighth scenario area.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The will-o'-the-wisp guides you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The will-o'-the-wisp buzzed before me like a little firefly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I didn't move right away. Because I needed to know where this place was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's late at night. The forest with lush broadleaf trees covering the sky felt somewhat mountainous and scary.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were no stars in the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even indirect messages were not heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I came up with a hypothesis in my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">First, this is an area that the constellations cannot yet see.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Second, the constellations are not interested because the area I am in is outside the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Whatever the theory, it was best to avoid battle as much as possible in my current state.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The cries of animals were often heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I crouched as low as I could and went into the bushes holding my breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Dokkaebi bag."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, the 'Dokkaebi Bag' worked normally.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I bought items needed for the homeless from the bag.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You purchased the item 'Body Odor Removal Spray'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You purchased the item 'Small Bed'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You purchased the item 'Someone’s old blanket'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A total of 800 coins were used.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">These were the things that the Demon King of Salvation once told me were 'great items for homeless people'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After spraying the surrounding area, I set up a 'bed' and covered it with 'someone's old blanket'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blanket fluttered like ectoplasm and slowly seeped into the background. From the outside, there was no way to tell that there was a hiding place in the bushes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The hidden item combination has been completed.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The special option 'It’s dangerous outside the blanket' is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When I squeezed inside the transparent blanket, I could clearly see outside.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The downside is that the interior is so narrow that one adult male can barely lie down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It didn't matter because I was the only one in the group anyway.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I slowly curled up under the thick blanket, for some reason, a familiar memory came to mind.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "If you look at books there, your eyes will get worse!" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Memories of hiding under a blanket and reading a book with a small light on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it my memory or Kim Dokja’s memory?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Is it okay?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Is it really that important to reveal the origins of anyone's memories?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "You have to sleep not too late." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I turned on the smartphone that Kim Dokja left behind and started reading 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">One day passed, and then two days passed. My daily routine was simple.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The will-o'-the-wisp guides you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When the sun rose, I followed the ghostly fire through the forest area, and at night, I took a nap in a blanket tent while reading 'Ways of survival'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sometimes I encountered monsters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Grrrr—!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The monster species encountered are mainly 7th grade or 8th grade species.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After two days of camping, my body recovered quite a bit and I was able to fight against monsters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The main thing I encountered was a huge wild boar.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[7th grade monster species 'Forest Wild Boar' has appeared.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As I was trying to take out my weapon as usual, I suddenly realized that the Demon King of Salvation had borrowed my thoughts of almost everything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, there was one weapon left to replace it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Unbroken faith.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja's main weapon, and the weapon left behind by the disappeared Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The bright blade of [Baekcheonganggi], which was now quite proficient, flashed.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Youngest, how do you use [Baekcheonganggi]? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I narrowly avoided the giant forest boar and refined my sword using the story 「Persistent Murin Master」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The wild boar fell down in an instant, blood pouring from its side.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 7th grade monster species 'Forest Wild Boar' has been defeated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After collecting its core, I immediately started butchering it. Because I haven't eaten anything for two days already.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 You can never starve. If you don't have enough energy, your head won't work well. Yoo Jonghyuk eats eight meals a day. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked for and read about the 'Forest Wild Boar’s butchering' in 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The poisonous horns were removed, the skin was removed, the intestines were taken out, and the meat was sliced along the spine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I gathered twigs and lit a fire.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no [Magic Brazier], but now it is possible to light a cooking flame without a brazier.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Youngest, Yoo Jonghyuk, the best cook, what number of sessions did he say? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">For cooking wild boar, refer to Yoo Jonghyuk's recipe from the 81st round. However, even though I followed Yoo Jonghyuk's recipe, the dish did not turn out well for some reason.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Probably because I am not Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Yoo Jonghyuk thought. 'Is it possible to achieve transcendence through cooking?' 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There are some obvious facts I learned while living alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, not all monster species are as delicious as 'Ground Puppy' or 'Yana Spreta'.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Yoo Jonghyuk thought as he watched Kim Namwoon spitting up what he just ate. 'You can’t eat these ingredients by cooking them'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Monsters must be slaughtered three or four times a day, and emergency food must be stored in case the hunt fails.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Yoo Jonghyuk thought as he looked at Kim Namwoon foaming at the mouth. 'If you eat this fruit, you will die within 1 minute'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even in the apocalypse, you have to maintain hygiene and occasionally wash your body under running water.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Kim Namwoon, you smell bad." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then Lee Jihye held her nose and walked away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Eww..…"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you don't have a place to wash, you can purchase [Clean Body] from the 'Dokkaebi Bag' and use it.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Kim Namwoon used [Clean Body] right away. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Use the item 'Clean Body'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[50 coins were consumed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Three days, then four days passed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's been a long time since I've been alone like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, memories of the day I first started living here came to mind.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Kim Namwoon prayed. "Captain, can’t I eat first this time?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The fact is that humans need to eat something every day to survive.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Yoo Jonghyuk gave the order. "No. From now on, you will be in charge of doing the laundry, Kim Namwoon!" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The fact is that someone has to constantly run the washing machine in order to wear clean clothes.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Yoo Jonghyuk gave the order. 'It’s your responsibility to clean up after monsters, Kim Namwoon." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The fact is that if you don't clean up what you eat right away, bugs will be attracted.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Yoo Jonghyuk gave the order. "And pay back 10,000 coins a day, Kim Namwoon." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The fact is that you have to work and earn money to pay rent and resident tax.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By experiencing those extremely obvious facts firsthand, I managed to grow into a decent member of society.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Yoo Jonghyuk gave the order, "Practice cutting 20,000 times a day!" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Things that must be done to become an ordinary adult.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Namwoon asked, "Damn it, how can I do all that!" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Since when did Kim Dokja start doing things like that on his own?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Yoo Jonghyuk answered, "I did it!" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I often thought about Kim Dokja, who endured his childhood alone without the help of his parents—the Demon King of Salvation at a time when no one could yet save him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A boy who worked to earn money, did laundry, cooked meals, washed dishes, occasionally paid rent, and read Ways of Survival before going to sleep.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Yoo Jonghyuk answered, "You can do it too." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Thinking of that boy, I also read 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And a week has passed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now monster hunting has become much more natural. The speed of butchering has also increased, and the skill proficiency has also increased.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I read 'Ways of Survival' repeatedly, looking for the information I needed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was able to properly distinguish between what was edible and what was not.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Whenever there was a stream, the water quality was checked and drinking water was stored.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I often washed my face with cold water. My face was reflected in the eerily clear stream.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' is looking at you blankly.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">For some reason, my face seemed to have changed a little. Is it an illusion?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Collect the new 'Kim Dokja Fragments'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Time remaining until death: 9 days 12:53]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I guess I’ll have to go get some new fragments soon."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Recycling Center' responds to your self-talk.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Recycling Center.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Over the past week, I've searched through the entire 'Ways of Survival' and found every bit of information about the eighth scenario.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Recycling Center' senses the potential for a new 'main character' in you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Originally, the eighth scenario on the Korean Peninsula was 'Black Castle'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">New Demon World—A stage that exists to elect the 73rd Lord of the Demon World.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the eighth stage of the 41st round was 'Recycling Center'.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 If 'Black Castle' is a stage for electing a new Demon King, then 'Recycling Center' is a stage for electing a new Constellation. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">An area that can only be reached through the 'Star Ladder'.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Any incarnation that graduates from the 'Recycling Center' can definitely become a 'Constellation' regardless of their origin. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">According to the explanation of the 'Ways of Survival', it was possible to rise to the status of a constellation with a sponsor by using the 'Recycling Center'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you look at it up to this point, it wasn't a bad scenario.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 But Yoo Jonghyuk almost never used the 'Recycling Center'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is that the level of difficulty of this 'Recycling Center' is such that even regressor Yoo Jonghyuk shakes his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was understandable that the Demon King of Salvation was reluctant about this scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But he eventually sent me here.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Guide ends.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Arrived at the 'assembly point'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, the wisp's guidance came to an end. I looked around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The place we arrived was the entrance to somewhere. At the entrance stood an usher holding a small attendance board in her hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hmm."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a guide wearing a sheep-shaped mask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is there anyone who hasn’t come in yet?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The receptionist looked me up and down and spoke in a bored voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It looks like you’re from the Frontier Nebula. Is that right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am not affiliated with any Nebula."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh. Oh my. There’s no nebula?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The receptionist must have felt sympathy for my answer, and suddenly started saying something strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It looks like some crazy sponsor is pushing their incarnation to death again. Were you also deceived by a story like 'A dragon arises in a stream'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There seems to be a story like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don’t know where you came from and what you heard, but if possible, it would be best to just go back. An incarnation like you will become prey as soon as you enter."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you, but I would like to go to the 'Recycling Center'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The receptionist, who didn't know my situation, shook his head as if another pathetic fool had appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yeah, well. It’s your life. I have to ask you a few questions to pass, is that okay?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Where are you from?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Seoul Dome."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you have any stories?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How many stories do you have?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There are three that I have accumulated myself."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You accumulated three stories yourself…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guide who had written down that far stopped and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Count the stories. You piled it all up? Who recommended this?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The Demon King of Salvation."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought he might know my background, but the guide was wearing sheep's clothing so I couldn't tell his expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guide who checked something nodded and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Your name is?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was about to answer Cheon Inho, but hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Your name is?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know why.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, I had a feeling that I shouldn't say that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I asked your name. I’m sure you didn’t forget it, right?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The guide doubts your identity.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[If you answer the wrong name, you will be immediately kicked out.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"There are a lot of unusual friends today. Including the black haired(?) clothed(?) kid who came in earlier…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of the Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’ll tell you in advance, if you say the wrong name, you will be immediately expelled. Only invited incarnations can come here—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">My playful constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was he who let me in here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"My name is—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly said one person's name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guide looked at me for a moment and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That’s a strange name."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I hear that a lot."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Welcome to the 'Recycling Center', Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
