<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why did you come?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a chance to finally make up for their long years.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, Yoo Jonghyuk abandoned the opportunity and came here with Biyoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If he’s here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk looked at the door of the hospital room and continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"And I had a hunch that he was going to do something strange."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You know you can’t return, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A regressor who has lived for a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk, who has now stopped even returning, made the same choice as her at the end of this story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung couldn't help but open her mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, even if you go through the first door, you'll end up unemployed again. You say you don't even play games anymore?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will open it this time."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk's rough palm touched the doorknob of the hospital room.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the door moved slowly, Han Sooyoung grabbed Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait for a sec."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk looked at Han Sooyoung and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Anyway, there will be no one."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">This world is 'the world that Kim Dokja did not return to'. So even if he opens the door to the hospital room, Kim Dokja will not be there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After completing her mental preparation, Han Sooyoung sighed lightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Open it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, in order to get Kim Dokja back, they have to start from 'losing Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, Han Sooyoung could not completely fool herself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe the analogy was misunderstood. If all of this is a prank by Kim Dokja, like a sentence that was forgotten and added belatedly, if there is the person she has been looking for for a long time in the unfolding scenery…</p>
<p class="orv_line">The wind blew through her hair through the open window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, no one was on the bed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it wasn't anything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung, like someone who spilled something on herself, approached the bed with gravity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A small note was left on the sunken bed, as if someone had been sitting there a while ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A memo neatly written in a familiar handwriting</p>
<p class="orv_line">—There's a story I haven't read yet. I'll be right back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung read the note over and over again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This sentence was not a lie.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She heard Yoo Jonghyuk breathe lightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung sat down holding the memo in her arms without even realizing it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja did not return.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, Han Sooyoung seemed to forgive him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You damn child..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was obviously alive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They can't see him, but somewhere far away in the universe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja is still reading an unfinished story.</p>

<p class="orv_line">In the faint spark, I read the story of Han Sooyoung.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I will find him with Biyoo. Now that the system is open, I can search the bottom of the world line again." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Stories that are heard in sparsely fragmented forms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Among them, there was the voice of Yoo Jonghyuk , the voice of Han Sooyoung, and there was also a voice whose identity was unknown.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Then check the world line over there..." 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I think if you’re a real reader hyung, you’ll definitely be here." 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "If it's the price to tell you where Kim Dokja is, how about it?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung's hardened face could be seen over the flowing story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth as I heard Seolhwa's voice slowly diminishing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It would have been fine if you had chosen the first 'portal'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">She could be happy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She could have met Kim Dokja again and have the long-awaited ending.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There must be an ending like that somewhere."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung answered while watching the disappearing sentences.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A 'happy ending' already existed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, she did not choose that option.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There are two options. One is the end for anyone to see, and the other is somewhat suspicious. In such a situation, it is obvious what the real Kim Dokja would choose. Because that damn guy likes 'stories' more than anyone else."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a sense, her choice was not wrong. She eventually found the traces of Kim Dokja and came this far.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dok-ja can make his imagination become real. Because his dream is reality. Kim Dokja in 'The First Portal' must have been real too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Maybe it was."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung nodded her head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since she acknowledged that possibility as well, she probably did not force her choice on Jung Heewon or the other members of Kim Dokja’s company.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Han Sooyoung must have come up with another possibility.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A possibility that Kim Dokja is alone with the tragedy of the far-off universe, with &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; confined in happy memories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She, with her great imagination, couldn't bear to turn away from that possibility.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I just picked the one I thought was more like Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was a bit envious of Kim Dokja at the upright confidence felt in her tone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja is in this world?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't know either. but..... At least you can see this world."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At last her grand story stopped talking. The wound I inflicted on the story had been repaired.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't like it. Because this isn't a story I wrote."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her story, which she once started, is now flowing into a development she does not know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung and I looked up at the sky at the same time. The color was slowly returning to the sky of the snowfield, which had been full of achromatic colors.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The skill's time limit was already running out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"For him to come back, this story must end."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because it was right after seeing the giant story, I could agree with her words to some extent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that wasn't the end, at least not now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's why I constantly wrote sentences in my head.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have described a content lacking in probability.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The success rate of reproducing this description is 8%.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have described the content lacking in probability.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The success rate of reproducing this description is 1%.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Throughout the fight with Han Sooyoung, I repeatedly wrote and erased sentences.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order to find a 'sentence' that will convince Han Sooyoung in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How many sentences did I edit and rewrite?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Possible contents have been described.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The description has a 78% success rate of reproduction.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I gambled to increase my success rate. Just like the day I first met Yoo Jonghyuk in the 41st turn, I raised my probability by sacrificing my arms.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The title of the scene is changed due to the sentence you added.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I bet everything I could write.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The success rate of reproducing this description is 95%.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can no longer increase your success rate.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Read reader feedback.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[No reader feedback exists.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Every 'reader' in the theater checks out your story.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have secured additional probability with more than a certain number of recommendations.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I said while looking at the sentence of the snow field I wrote.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja may want to continue watching the story."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Maybe, but this story is not worth it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What if Dokja Kim’s taste has changed? The story you wrote is no longer interesting."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Soo-young smiled and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you serious?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The scenery of the snowfield collapsed with a cooing sound.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exiting the  'Snowfield'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The stopped time started to flow again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Taking advantage of Han Sooyoung's surprise, I shouted at Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who was still resisting the mental attack, turned to me with a creak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wasn't sure if I could give more mental load to the target who had already used [Incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon's lips said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Inho-ssi. Hurry.'</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.6' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I took a deep breath and spoke all at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You are unaffected by 'mind attack' from now on!"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation 'Jung Heewon' receives the effect of 'Incite'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation 'Jung Heewon' is already under the effect of 'incite'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The effect of 'Incite' is multiplied and the penalty is raised!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The duration of 'Incite' is extremely short!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who vomited blood from her mouth, swung her sword forward again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The mental attacks from the Theater’s Owner couldn't bother her any more.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's amazing, can you do something like this with 'Incite'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung said while blocking Jung Heewon's sword with her left hand wrapped in [Black Flame].</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But this is how Jung Heewon dies, you know?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung HeeWon, whose complexion turned pale, growled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm not dying."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps realizing that she couldn't approach the Theater’s Owner without dealing with Han Sooyoung, Jung Heewon's [Kendo] twisted its trajectory.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Judgment Time poured out explosive fighting power in a short period of time. In addition, Kendo, which had risen, had been added.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Her swordsmanship, which cuts the level 7 monsters in an instant, launched an all-out offensive at Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Look at this"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's good that Han Sooyoung was pushed away for a moment by that non-stop offensive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I ran quickly and shouted. I’m</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.6' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Turn into 'Broken Faith'!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Along with my words, 'Thoughts of almost everything' emitted a bright light and formed the shape of a sword. It was the mimicry form obtained when defeating the script writer.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Thoughts of almost everything' mimics Broken Faith (mass production type)!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Before I knew it, the simulation was right in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung, who found me belatedly, narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I-"</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Broken Faith''s special option was 'Blade of Faith'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I didn't have strong qigong skills, so I couldn't use 'Blade of Faith'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it was before, it would have been the case.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I raised the mana of my whole body and focused it on my broken faith.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Please save my brother." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It is a skill that Literature Girl 64 passed on to me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Activates the exclusive skill 'White Blue Steel Lv.1'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Activates 'Blade of Faith'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The ether blade moved, scattering dazzling white light, and the Theater Owner reflexively crouched.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a bright flash, both arms of the Theater Owner flew in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued to wield my sword while reciting an incantation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Activates the exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.6'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"… am Yoo Jonghyuk."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the trail of the sword finally reached the neck of the Theater Owner, someone pulled my back strongly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When were they summoned?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Two of Han Sooyoung's [avatars] were holding onto my shoulders. What followed was a strong jolt in my side and shin. The blade flew through the air in an instant, and I knelt on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I sat down with dizziness, I saw Jung Heewon, who vomited blood from her mouth, also lost consciousness and passed out.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Incite'’s effect ends.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">An enormous recoil engulfed Jung Heewon's entire body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It was a failure." She said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Despite fighting against her strong limitations, it was not enough to defeat Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung let out a light sigh and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It was a little dangerous."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized how big the difference between her and my capabilities was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Feeling her victory, Han Sooyoung looked down at me and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Now you know the difference, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew from the beginning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I probably won't be able to beat Han Sooyoung even if a truck comes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So I thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It doesn't have to be me who wins."</p>
<p class="orv_line">An enormous reverberation felt from behind. Han Sooyoung, her eyes wide open, looked behind me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A man in a black coat was waking up from a deep depression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The person who ends the story is the protagonist of this story."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Incite'’s effect activates!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "You are Yoo Jonghyuk." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The effect of [Incite], which was used while cutting off the arms of the Theater Owner, was now gone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk started running. He didn't seem to be completely out of 'regressive depression' yet, but he seemed to know what he had to do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The spear held in his hand drew destructive magic in a straight line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung, in a hurry, pulled out her sword for the first time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I admired the pure white sword in her hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung also made that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Unbreakable Faith.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know how it was made.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, unlike me, her sword was neither mass-produced nor fake, but real.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I saw the dazzling brilliance of the sword, I shuddered.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The author of this story is also Han Sooyoung. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps I will never become a writer like her in my whole life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I let go of the [Avatar] that was holding me back, exploding my whole body's mana. Then, holding onto the 'Broken Faith' that had fallen on the floor, I ran towards Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung, who was facing Yoo Jonghyuk’s sword, looked back at me in surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did I ask you to convince me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The two blades of faith collided fiercely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you ready to be persuaded?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung's eyes shook.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk’s new type, who did not miss the opportunity, leisurely passed by us and moved to end the Theater Owner.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsutsutsutsu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Embarrassed, Han Sooyoung shouted at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it was usual, Han Sooyoung would be able to shake me off and stand her ground.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It would have been.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But this time it was impossible.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Because this is such a story. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung finally realized what was going on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You, please."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps my role in this story is, at best, a bridge.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you're a writer, you'd know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">But even that was enough.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If only one more reader could survive. If they can see the end of the story after going through the 'main story' and the 'side stories'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You're not trying to finish the story, you're giving up."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I am willing to be broken to complete this story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung's 'unbreakable faith' vomited black salt, and I desperately blocked her path.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blade of 'Broken Faith' crumbled helplessly, and soon I felt the Blade of Faith disappear.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 There is no such thing as one magic sentence that will convince someone. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Like a writer refining the end of a pre-determined story, I smiled at Han Sooyoung.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Because all miracles require the price of probability. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of Yoo Jonghyuk’s spear piercing the head of the Theater’s Owner was heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, Kim Dokja's face came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is that guy still reading this story?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, I always envied him.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Then, did I get a little closer to him? 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Succeeded in reproducing the scene.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the sharp blade pierced my chest, I remembered one thing I had forgotten.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Tell that guy. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I managed to get my hands into my pockets, but my arms weren't strong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, the Theater’s Owner disappeared, and Yoo Jonghyuk was seen collapsing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The dome surrounding the rooftop garden was lifted.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Someone has cleared the theater dungeon.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My vision was blurred.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart grew colder and my whole body lost strength. I just fell to the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of Han Sooyoung shouting something came like an echo.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The readers died and became 'kkomas Kim Dokja'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the slowly fading consciousness, I saw the scenery of the night sky.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Then what will I become after I die? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What came to my mind at the last moment was, unexpectedly, the last sentence of my debut work.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 He walked towards his origin like that. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I closed my eyes, holding the item in my pocket that I couldn't deliver.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There seemed to be a lemon scent somewhere.</p>
