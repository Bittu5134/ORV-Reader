<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why did you come?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a chance to finally make up for their long years.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, Yoo Jonghyuk abandoned the opportunity and came here with Biyoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If he’s here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jung-hyeok looked at the door of the hospital room and continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And I had a hunch that he was going to do something strange.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You know you can’t return, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A regressor who has lived for a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk, who has now stopped even returning, made the same choice as her at the end of this story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung couldn&#39;t help but open her mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, even if you go through the first door, you&#39;ll end up unemployed again. You say you don&#39;t even play games anymore?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will open it this time.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jung-hyeok&#39;s rough palm touched the doorknob of the hospital room.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the door moved slowly, Han Sooyoung grabbed Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait for a sec.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk looked at Han Sooyoung and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Anyway, there will be no one.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This world is &#39;the world that Kim Dokja did not return to&#39;. So even if he opens the door to the hospital room, Kim Dokja will not be there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After completing her mental preparation, Han Sooyoung sighed lightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Open it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, in order to get Kim Dokja back, they have to start from &#39;losing Kim Dokja&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, Han Sooyoung could not completely fool herself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe the analogy was misunderstood. If all of this is a prank by Kim Dokja, like a sentence that was forgotten and added belatedly, if there is the person she has been looking for for a long time in the unfolding scenery…</p>
<p class="orv_line">The wind blew through her hair through the open window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, no one was on the bed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it wasn&#39;t anything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung, like someone who spilled something on herself, approached the bed with gravity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A small note was left on the sunken bed, as if someone had been sitting there a while ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A memo neatly written in a familiar handwriting</p>
<p class="orv_line">—There&#39;s a story I haven&#39;t read yet. I&#39;ll be right back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung read the note over and over again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This sentence was not a lie.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She heard Yoo Jonghyuk breathe lightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung sat down holding the memo in her arms without even realizing it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja did not return.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, Han Sooyoung seemed to forgive him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You damn child...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was obviously alive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They can&#39;t see him, but somewhere far away in the universe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja is still reading an unfinished story.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In the faint spark, I read the story of Han Sooyoung.</p>
「&quot;I will find him with Biyoo. Now that the system is open, I can search the bottom of the world line again.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Stories that are heard in sparsely fragmented forms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Among them, there was the voice of Yoo Jonghyuk , the voice of Han Sooyoung, and there was also a voice whose identity was unknown.</p>
「&quot;Then check the world line over there...&quot;」</p></div>
「&quot;I think if you’re a real reader hyung, you’ll definitely be here.&quot;」</p></div>
「&quot;If it&#39;s the price to tell you where Kim Dokja is, how about it?&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung&#39;s hardened face could be seen over the flowing story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth as I heard Seolhwa&#39;s voice slowly diminishing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It would have been fine if you had chosen the first &#39;portal&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">She could be happy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She could have met Kim Dokja again and have the long-awaited ending.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There must be an ending like that somewhere.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung answered while watching the disappearing sentences.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A &#39;happy ending&#39; already existed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, she did not choose that option.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There are two options. One is the end for anyone to see, and the other is somewhat suspicious. In such a situation, it is obvious what the real Kim Dokja would choose. Because that damn guy likes &#39;stories&#39; more than anyone else.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a sense, her choice was not wrong. She eventually found the traces of Kim Dokja and came this far.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Dok-ja can make his imagination become real. Because his dream is reality. Kim Dokja in &#39;The First Portal&#39; must have been real too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe it was.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung nodded her head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since she acknowledged that possibility as well, she probably did not force her choice on Jung Heewon or the other members of Kim Dokja’s company.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Han Sooyoung must have come up with another possibility.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A possibility that Kim Dokja is alone with the tragedy of the far-off universe, with &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; confined in happy memories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She, with her great imagination, couldn&#39;t bear to turn away from that possibility.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I just picked the one I thought was more like Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was a bit envious of Kim Dokja at the upright confidence felt in her tone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Dokja is in this world?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t know either. but..... At least you can see this world.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At last her grand story stopped talking. The wound I inflicted on the story had been repaired.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t like it. Because this isn&#39;t a story I wrote.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her story, which she once started, is now flowing into a development she does not know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung and I looked up at the sky at the same time. The color was slowly returning to the sky of the snowfield, which had been full of achromatic colors.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The skill&#39;s time limit was already running out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;For him to come back, this story must end.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because it was right after seeing the giant story, I could agree with her words to some extent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that wasn&#39;t the end, at least not now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s why I constantly wrote sentences in my head.</p>

[You have described the content lacking in probability.]</p></div>
[The success rate of reproducing this description is 1%.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Throughout the fight with Han Sooyoung, I repeatedly wrote and erased sentences.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order to find a &#39;sentence&#39; that will convince Han Sooyoung in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How many sentences did I edit and rewrite?</p>
[Possible contents have been described.]</p></div>
[The description has a 78% success rate of reproduction.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I gambled to increase my success rate. Just like the day I first met Yoo Jonghyuk in the 41st turn, I raised my probability by sacrificing my arms.</p>
[The title of the scene is changed due to the sentence you added.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I bet everything I could write.</p>
[The success rate of reproducing this description is 95%.]</p></div>

[No reader feedback exists.]</p></div>
[Every &#39;reader&#39; in the theater checks out your story.]</p></div>
[You have secured additional probability with more than a certain number of recommendations.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I said while looking at the sentence of the snow field I wrote.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Dokja may want to continue watching the story.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe, but this story is not worth it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What if Dokja Kim’s taste has changed? The story you wrote is no longer interesting.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Soo-young smiled and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you serious?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The scenery of the snowfield collapsed with a cooing sound.</p>
[Exiting the  &#39;Snowfield&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The stopped time started to flow again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Taking advantage of Han Sooyoung&#39;s surprise, I shouted at Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Heewon-ssi!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who was still resisting the mental attack, turned to me with a creak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wasn&#39;t sure if I could give more mental load to the target who had already used [Incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon&#39;s lips said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Inho-ssi. Hurry.&#39;</p>
[Exclusive skill &#39;Incite Lv.6&#39; is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I took a deep breath and spoke all at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You are unaffected by &#39;mind attack&#39; from now on!&quot;</p>
[Incarnation &#39;Jung Heewon&#39; receives the effect of &#39;Incite&#39;!]</p></div>
[Incarnation &#39;Jung Heewon&#39; is already under the effect of &#39;incite&#39;!]</p></div>
[The effect of &#39;Incite&#39; is multiplied and the penalty is raised!]</p></div>
[The duration of &#39;Incite&#39; is extremely short!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who vomited blood from her mouth, swung her sword forward again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The mental attacks from the Theater’s Owner couldn&#39;t bother her any more.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s amazing, can you do something like this with &#39;Incite&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung said while blocking Jung Heewon&#39;s sword with her left hand wrapped in [Black Flame].</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But this is how Jung Heewon dies, you know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung HeeWon, whose complexion turned pale, growled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m not dying.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps realizing that she couldn&#39;t approach the Theater’s Owner without dealing with Han Sooyoung, Jung Heewon&#39;s [Kendo] twisted its trajectory.</p>
[Judgment Time poured out explosive fighting power in a short period of time. In addition, Kendo, which had risen, had been added.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Her swordsmanship, which cuts the level 7 monsters in an instant, launched an all-out offensive at Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Look at this&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s good that Han Sooyoung was pushed away for a moment by that non-stop offensive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I ran quickly and shouted. I’m</p>
[Exclusive skill, &#39;Incite Lv.6&#39; is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Turn into &#39;Broken Faith&#39;!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Along with my words, &#39;Thoughts of almost everything&#39; emitted a bright light and formed the shape of a sword. It was the mimicry form obtained when defeating the script writer.</p>
[&#39;Thoughts of almost everything&#39; mimics Broken Faith (mass production type)!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Before I knew it, the simulation was right in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung, who found me belatedly, narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I-&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Broken Faith&#39;&#39;s special option was &#39;Blade of Faith&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I didn&#39;t have strong qigong skills, so I couldn&#39;t use &#39;Blade of Faith&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it was before, it would have been the case.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I raised the mana of my whole body and focused it on my broken faith.</p>
「&quot;Please save my brother.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It is a skill that Literature Girl 64 passed on to me.</p>
[Activates the exclusive skill &#39;White Blue Steel Lv.1&#39;!]</p></div>
[Activates &#39;Blade of Faith&#39;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The ether blade moved, scattering dazzling white light, and the Theater Owner reflexively crouched.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a bright flash, both arms of the Theater Owner flew in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued to wield my sword while reciting an incantation.</p>
[Activates the exclusive skill &#39;Incite Lv.6&#39;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;… am Yoo Jonghyuk.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the trail of the sword finally reached the neck of the Theater Owner, someone pulled my back strongly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When were they summoned?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Two of Han Sooyoung&#39;s [avatars] were holding onto my shoulders. What followed was a strong jolt in my side and shin. The blade flew through the air in an instant, and I knelt on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I sat down with dizziness, I saw Jung Heewon, who vomited blood from her mouth, also lose consciousness and pass out.</p>
[&#39;Incite&#39;’s effect ends.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">An enormous recoil engulfed Jung Heewon&#39;s entire body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It was a failure.&quot; She said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Despite fighting against her strong limitations, it was not enough to defeat Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung let out a light sigh and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It was a little dangerous.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized how big the difference between her and my capabilities was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Feeling her victory, Han Sooyoung looked down at me and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Now you know the difference, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew from the beginning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I probably won&#39;t be able to beat Han Sooyoung even if a truck comes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So I thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It doesn&#39;t have to be me who wins.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">An enormous reverberation felt from behind. Han Sooyoung, her eyes wide open, looked behind me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A man in a black coat was waking up from a deep depression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The person who ends the story is the protagonist of this story.&quot;</p>
[&#39;Incite&#39;’s effect activates!]</p></div>
「&quot;You are Yoo Jonghyuk.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The effect of [Incite], which was used while cutting off the arms of the Theater Owner, was now gone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk started running. He didn&#39;t seem to be completely out of &#39;regressive depression&#39; yet, but he seemed to know what he had to do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The spear held in his hand drew destructive magic in a straight line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung, in a hurry, pulled out her sword for the first time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I admired the pure white sword in her hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung also made that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Unbreakable Faith.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know how it was made.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, unlike me, her sword was neither mass-produced nor fake, but real.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I saw the dazzling brilliance of the sword, I shuddered.</p>
「The author of this story is also Han Sooyoung.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps I will never become a writer like her in my whole life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I let go of the [Avatar] that was holding me back, exploding my whole body&#39;s mana. Then, holding onto the &#39;Broken Faith&#39; that had fallen on the floor, I ran towards Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung, who was facing Yoo Jonghyuk’s sword, looked back at me in surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did I ask you to convince me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The two blades of faith collided fiercely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you ready to be persuaded?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung&#39;s eyes shook.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk’s new type, who did not miss the opportunity, leisurely passed by us and moved to end the Theater Owner.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsutsutsutsu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Embarrassed, Han Sooyoung shouted at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it was usual, Han Sooyoung would be able to shake me off and stand her ground.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It would have been.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But this time it was impossible.</p>
「Because this is such a story.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung finally realized what was going on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You, please.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps my role in this story is, at best, a bridge.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you&#39;re a writer, you&#39;d know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">But even that was enough.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If only one more reader could survive. If they can see the end of the story after going through the &#39;main story&#39; and the &#39;side stories&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re not trying to finish the story, you&#39;re giving up.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I am willing to be broken to complete this story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung&#39;s &#39;unbreakable faith&#39; vomited black salt, and I desperately blocked her path.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blade of &#39;Broken Faith&#39; crumbled helplessly, and soon I felt the Blade of Faith disappear.</p>
「There is no such thing as one magic sentence that will convince someone.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Like a writer refining the end of a pre-determined story, I smiled at Han Sooyoung.</p>
「Because all miracles require the price of probability.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of Yoo Jonghyuk’s spear piercing the head of the Theater’s Owner was heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, Kim Dokja&#39;s face came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is that guy still reading this story?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, I always envied him.</p>
「Then, did I get a little closer to him?」</p></div>
[Succeeded in reproducing the scene.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the sharp blade pierced my chest, I remembered one thing I had forgotten.</p>
「Tell that guy.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I managed to get my hands into my pockets, but my arms weren&#39;t strong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, the Theater’s Owner disappeared, and Yoo Jonghyuk was seen collapsing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The dome surrounding the rooftop garden was lifted.</p>
[Someone has cleared the theater dungeon.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My vision was blurred.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart grew colder and my whole body lost strength. I just fell to the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of Han Sooyoung shouting something came like an echo.</p>
「The readers died and became &#39;kkomas Kim Dokja&#39;.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the slowly fading consciousness, I saw the scenery of the night sky.</p>
「Then what will I become after I die?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What came to my mind at the last moment was, unexpectedly, the last sentence of my debut work.</p>
「He walked towards his origin like that.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I closed my eyes, holding the item in my pocket that I couldn&#39;t deliver.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There seemed to be a lemon scent somewhere.</p>
