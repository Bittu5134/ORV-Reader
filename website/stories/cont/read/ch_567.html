            <div class="orv_title"><h1>567 Episode 3. Protagonist(?) (4)</h1></div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">There is an immutable law that those worthy know.</p>
「A man with narrow eyes is stronger when he opens his eyes.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I squeezed both eyes. Slowly, my eyelids rose.</p>
「I am Yoo Joonghyuk.」</p></div>
[&#39;Incite&#39; is effective.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Little by little, I began to have strange thoughts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe I really am Yoo Joonghyuk?</p>
[&#39;Incite&#39; is in full effect.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I felt skeptical of everything I was about to do. I don&#39;t know why, but I also felt like</p>
<p class="orv_line">finding and killing Kim Dokja.</p>
「No, you can&#39;t be that Yoo Joonghyuk.」</p></div>
[The effect of &#39;Incite&#39; is being adjusted.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I (lightly) became Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo&#39;s eyes widened as he met mine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you really think that Bluff would work?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was my voice, but it suddenly sounded cool.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is how Yoo Joonghyuk feels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo&#39;s [Bluff] didn&#39;t even tickle him.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Monarch of the Small Fries&#39; feels a bizarre fear from you.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Sneaking Schemer&#39; looks at you as if they&#39;re offended.]</p></div>
[A constellation who hasn&#39;t revealed their modifier is looking at you with strange eyes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It seems to have worked, as even the constellations were surprised.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo was visibly flustered when his [Bluff] didn&#39;t work, and he clenched his knuckled</p>
<p class="orv_line">fists tightly.</p>
[The character &#39;Bang Cheolsoo&#39; has used &#39;Threaten&#39;.]</p></div>
[For some unknown reason, &#39;Threaten&#39; doesn&#39;t work on you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, a bead of sweat formed on his forehead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re a very strong man.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even without the [Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint], I could see through him.</p>
「If you get caught here, you&#39;re done for.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Shall I just end it here?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#39;m comfortable with killing all of these guys.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A cursory glance tells me there aren&#39;t any other possessed here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But for some reason, I don&#39;t like the idea.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No one likes to kill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tried saying this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Lee Cheoldoo said he doesn&#39;t want you to waste your life in vain.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How do you know about him?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;ve heard a lot about you from Cheoldoo.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At my words, Dansoo ahjussi looked at me in surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo looked confused.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I accompanied him to Geumho Station. He said he would introduce me to you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I-I didn&#39;t hear anything like that from Cheoldoo hyung-nim.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;When did he report such things to you one by one?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheoldoo hyung-nim...... Where is he?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo&#39;s words suddenly became polite. It was evidence that he was shaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead of answering, I looked theatrically to my left, where the headless body of Lee Cheoldoo</p>
<p class="orv_line">lay.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo staggered toward Lee Cheoldoo&#39;s body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It was a fitting end for him. He died fighting.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;With whom—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Revenge.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">At the end of my gaze, the body of the Life Leader stretched out before me.</p>

[The constellation &#39;Monarch of the Samll Fries&#39; likes the sudden noir.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo stared at me blankly, then bit his lip tightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How can I believe that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It is your freedom to believe it or not.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you&#39;re the one who sent Cheoldoo hyung-nim to.......!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you are going to do it, then take revenge on me right now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo stood up, glaring at me with red eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, it didn&#39;t seem like the behavior of someone who was really motivated.</p>
[The character &#39;Bang Cheolsoo&#39; is looking at you.]</p></div>
[The character &#39;Bang Cheolsoo&#39; wants to do something unexpected.]</p></div>
[The activation condition for the exclusive skill &#39;□□&#39; has been met.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I see.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I think I know a little bit about this skill&#39;s activation condition now.</p>
[The exclusive skill &#39;□□&#39; is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The scenery around me turned colorless, and the people began to stiffen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I look at the letters floating around, I realize that it&#39;s time to create once again.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo can&#39;t be like Kim Cheolyang.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Life Leader Kim Cheolyang was originally part of the Ten Evils and also possessed</p>
<p class="orv_line">the attribute of the Crouching Figure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo, on the other hand, is just an ordinary junkie.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But when the system says it like that, it makes me wonder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It might be the author&#39;s arrogance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In &lt;Star Stream&gt;, how far can an ordinary extra villain really change?</p>

<p>* At your current skill level, you can write a total of 160 additional characters.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">160 characters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could write 10 more characters than last time.</p>
[You can stay in the &#39;Snowfield&#39; for a total of 3 minutes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This is definitely better than last time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because I now know a little bit about this skill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">First of all, this skill can&#39;t reproduce &#39;ridiculous&#39; changes in reality.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, a character can&#39;t suddenly awaken memories of a previous life as a martial arts</p>
<p class="orv_line">master and become your loyal servant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">You&#39;re more likely to succeed if you describe a behavior that matches the character&#39;s desires.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From the message I received before, it seems that I can make additional changes as I accumulate</p>
<p class="orv_line">probability.</p>
[Current Accumulated Probability: 10]</p></div>
[You can increase the reproduction success rate by getting more probability.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to make much of a difference with this amount.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#39;ll write for now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I painstakingly crammed in a sentence of about 160 characters.</p>
[This story&#39;s reproduction success rate is 88%.]</p></div>
[There&#39;s enough probability.]</p></div>
[Do you want to check the reader&#39;s feedback?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, there was this function too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">KimDokja37 or something replies.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder if he&#39;s the real Kim Dokja?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then what&#39;s the number 37?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Yes.&#39;</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>rlaehrwk37: I hear the sound of Bang Cheolsoo&#39;s washing machine running.</p>

<br>
<p class="orv_line">There was another Kim Dokja?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, judging by the reactions, it didn&#39;t seem like this development would cause any serious</p>
<p class="orv_line">problems.</p>
[Successfully recreating the scene.]</p></div>
[Leaving the &#39;Snowfield&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The letters disappeared into thin air, and the story began again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sucked in a breath and spat out the words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Life&#39;s boring....... Don&#39;t you think so?&quot;</p>
「Bang Cheolsoo listened to the words in a daze.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">over this world. Long before the scenario began, his world was doomed.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Extras also have their own stories. No matter how inscrutable and mundane it was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How long are you going to live as the Assault Force Captain of the Cheoldoo Group?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What? What do you know—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The world has changed. It&#39;s not the one you&#39;ve always resented, and it&#39;s time for the likes of you</p>
<p class="orv_line">to make peace with the past.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You have a choice. You can follow me, or you can continue to live your pathetic little life.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo&#39;s eyes shook faintly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">1,863 regressions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Throughout Yoo Joonghyuk&#39;s regressions in Ways of Survival, Bang Cheolsoo was always the</p>
<p class="orv_line">Assault Force Captain of Cheoldoo Group.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He lived as the Assault Force Captain and died as the Assault Force Captain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was not given a moment to think about the value or dignity of life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He should not have been rehabilitated. He should not have been rehabilitated, he had to be</p>
<p class="orv_line">pointed out by people and become a trophy for the protagonist to shine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hence, this sentence I wrote.</p>
「Do I still have a choice?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a possibility granted to the fabricated villain.</p>
「Could he be my cause?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo, his mind made up, stood up and said.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Prove it to me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo charged at me, fists pumping. It was a desperate move, like he was throwing his</p>
<p class="orv_line">life away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But he didn&#39;t mean it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He had made a choice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Peoeog!</p>
<p class="orv_line">I threw a light punch to the face of the running man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo let out an exaggerated scream and fell to the ground.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hadn&#39;t hit him that hard, but he was clever.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;H-hyung-nim!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the panicked Cheoldoo Group raised their pipes indignantly toward me, Bang Cheolsoo</p>
<p class="orv_line">raised his left hand to wipe his nose.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Stop.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He looked at me for a long moment, then opened his mouth as if he had been bound by the</p>
<p class="orv_line">punch.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Now that Cheoldoo hyung-nim is dead, I am the acting leader of the Cheoldoo Group. I decide</p>
<p class="orv_line">who to follow. Do you all have any complaints?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;W-we have no complaints.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">of an &#39;extra&#39;.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Until now, he was just an extra who lived a few sentences. If the writer wanted him to die, he</p>
<p class="orv_line">died, and if he wanted him to live, he lived.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But today, he used his imagination to think about the future.</p>

[The character &#39;Bang Cheolsoo&#39; is showing signs of slight evolution.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo stretched out his hand toward me and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I replied, helping such a Bang Cheolsoo to his feet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheon Inho.&quot;</p>

<br>
<p class="orv_line">[The constellation &#39;Prisoner of the Golden Headband&#39; finds your handling of the situation</p>
<p class="orv_line">interesting.]</p>
[The constellation &#39;Monarch of the Small Fries&#39; is impressed by the hot noir you showed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Monarch of the Small Fries, that bastard was like that in the main story, I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s</p>
<p class="orv_line">thinking. The incarnation he was raising was given to me, and he&#39;s still talking nonsense.</p>
<p class="orv_line">seriously injured.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced at Bang Cheolsoo, who was leading the way, and hit him in the back of the head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why, why did you do that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There was a bug.&quot;</p>
[The constellation &#39;Monarch of the Small Fries&#39; has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo glanced at me with trembling eyes, then began to lead me two steps ahead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There should be a group of people over there.&quot;</p>
[There are currently eleven people in Geumho Station who support you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I&#39;ve got the 10 people from the Cheoldoo Group on my side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This rate was not bad.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that Dansoo ahjussi, who was walking beside me, cautiously asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re not really Chen Inho, are you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled and replied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I am, for now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi sighed lightly at my joke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He looked at the Cheoldoo Group walking ahead of us and asked in a low voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Will it be all right? You know how those guys are like.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Earlier, you asked me if I would let everyone die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But those guys are.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I understood what he meant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know what the Cheoldoo Group is like. They are the ones who will commit the most heinous</p>
<p class="orv_line">crimes in the future.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason I spared them is simple.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">「If you&#39;re going to use them the same way, there&#39;s no point in using them at all.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m just using them. We need to collect them quickly to reduce unnecessary disturbances at</p>
<p class="orv_line">Geumho Station. If they&#39;re going to be enemies, it&#39;s easier to keep them under control than to</p>
<p class="orv_line">fight them.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There they are.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at Dansoo ahjussi nodding his head in understanding, I suddenly remembered a reader&#39;s</p>
<p class="orv_line">comment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—So he got beaten to death at Geumho Station every time Yoo Joonghyuk regressed?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at the back of Bang Cheolsoo&#39;s head, which looked a bit grim, and shook my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Forget it. Now is not the time for such complicated thoughts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Kim Dokja and the other main characters survived the first scenario, they will come to</p>
<p class="orv_line">Geumho Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Kim Dokja was eaten by the ichtyosaur like in Omniscient Reader, it would be the group and</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk that would arrive here first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If we wanted to give him a good impression, we&#39;d need to turn this Cheoldoo Group bastards in</p>
<p class="orv_line">the guards of Geumho Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo stopped walking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We&#39;re here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The survivors of the first scenario gathered in the stairwell.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took a deep breath and studied their faces, one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is where my &#39;rehabilitation project&#39; comes into play.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though Cheon Inho was a trashy demagogue villain in the original Omniscient Reader, he</p>
<p class="orv_line">needed to be reformed into a proper human being here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Okay, I&#39;ve decided it. First, let&#39;s take over Geumho Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Next, let&#39;s be Yoo Joonghyuk&#39;s subordinate.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And then, when Yoo Joonghyuk has had enough of being a sunfish, we&#39;ll become Kim Dokja&#39;s</p>
<p class="orv_line">men.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you understand unni? Be careful of that man.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The voice came from nowhere, and I reflexively turned around to see a very familiar face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was at Geumho Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I hadn&#39;t expected her to be the first &lt;Kim Dokja&#39;s Company&gt; member I encountered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I ran toward her with excitement.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She is the first sword of the Demon King of Salvation Kim Dokja, and the guardian of &lt;Kim</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dokja&#39;s Company&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Protected by the archangel Uriel, she is one of the strongest characters in Omniscient Reader.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, the Judge of Destruction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After catching my gaze, Jung Heewon looked back at me from afar. I greeted her first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hello!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, yeah...... Hi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon acknowledged my greeting with a faint smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She must have nerves of steel to be able to smile like that even though she had just performed the</p>
<p class="orv_line">first scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Which section are you from?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, we&#39;re in the 3-4.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You have...... Did something similar happen there?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Checking my bloody apron, Jung Heewon looked slightly wary.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just in time, Dansoo ahjussi approached.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;My friend and I didn&#39;t kill people, we killed other creatures.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, really? Actually, I also.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon stopped talking at that point, glancing around her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I realized something was wrong.</p>
「Jung Heewon didn&#39;t kill people?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It couldn&#39;t be. In the main story, she must have cleared the scenario normally.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How the hell did she—?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Excuse me, what&#39;s your name? I&#39;m Jung Heewon.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m Cheon Inho.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">For some reason, the moment she heard my name, her face hardened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As she looked at me with her cold eyes, I suddenly remembered something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the main part of Omniscient Reader, Jung Heewon killed Cheon Inho by stabbing him through</p>
<p class="orv_line">the head at Geumho Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I was touching the top of my head with a chill, Jung Heewon, who had taken a few steps</p>
<p class="orv_line">away from me, spoke to someone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He showed up just like you said.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Already? Where?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That guy. But is he the real deal?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow, he looks the part. Wouldn&#39;t you know it by looking at him?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Umm, I&#39;m not sure.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Looking closer, there was a girl about a foot shorter than Jung Heewon clinging to her side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Get a hold of yourself, unni, you shouldn&#39;t trust him. What did I say about him earlier? Tell</p>
<p class="orv_line">me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon nodded and replied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Bad guy. The guy to be teared to death. Someone to burn to death with Hellfire.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">......Where did I hear that before?</p>
