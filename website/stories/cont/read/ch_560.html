            <div class="orv_title"><h1>560 Episode 2. Rewrite (5)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">The people who watched the prime minister die in real time lost their minds and ran toward the</p>
<p class="orv_line">transparent wall they had pushed against earlier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We have to get out of here now! Break this wall!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Push it again, it might get pushed back!&quot;</p>
[Until the scenario in the area is completed, any kind of entry or exit is restricted.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Panicked people clung to the transparent wall. They reminded me of a swarm of insects in a</p>
<p class="orv_line">mosquito net.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took a short, deep breath and shouted in a loud voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Everyone, pull yourself together. There&#39;s still plenty of time.&quot;</p>
[The constellation &#39;Monarch of the Small Fries&#39; is looking at you with a strange look on his eyes.]</p></div>
[A few constellations are surprised by your calmness.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It was the lawmakers who died, not us.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The people look up at you with dazed faces.</p>
[Some incarnations begin to rely on you.]</p></div>
[Your influence in the scenario area has exceeded a threshold.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Now that their reason was paralyzed by fear, I had an opportunity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We can still choose how to survive.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">How way to survive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One by one, the people cowering nearby stood up, looking at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;B-but. But they&#39;re all dead! The president, the prime minister―&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They were just ordinary people too, who happened to wear those titles.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I heard someone hiccup.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Get a grip. If you lose your mind here, you&#39;ll be left with only one option.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;.......&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And that&#39;s going to kill most of us here. Of course, some of us will survive, but they&#39;ll be few.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced toward the big guy as I said that, and he growled and glared at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that was his mistake. One by one, the people nearby swarmed toward me, wary of the man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What the hell, you guys.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">They realized. How the weak survive in a predatory ecosystem where laws and rules are broken.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued speaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No one has to die. The strong, the weak, everyone can survive, and there&#39;s no need to be</p>
<p class="orv_line">disappointed that the bugs failed, it was just the &#39;first way&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">One by one, people&#39;s faces changed. Among them, the one whose expression changed</p>
<p class="orv_line">dramatically was the deacon&#39;s, Kim Cheolyang, who had made the mistake of saying &#39;pretty well&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">earlier.</p>
[The character &#39;Kim Cheolyang&#39; is convinced by your words.]</p></div>
[Character &#39;Kim Cheolyang&#39; feels a strong sense of trust in you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is there another way? Besides bugs or people...... What else could we kill.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">While people were confused, I thought and thought and thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If we couldn&#39;t use &#39;bugs&#39; anymore, now I had to find a new answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first thing I did was to open my phone and check the comments on the &#39;first episode&#39; of</p>
<p class="orv_line">Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—If a bug works out, what about bacterias? Bacterias are living things.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is a story I didn&#39;t write.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Doesn&#39;t stomach acid kill bacteria even if you don&#39;t move? Doesn&#39;t that mean you can survive</p>
<p class="orv_line">without doing anything?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Ah, that&#39;s ridiculous.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A world line that exists only as a possibility, imagined by the collective intelligence of readers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—What&#39;s the principle of hand sanitizer? Doesn&#39;t it kill germs?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Wouldn&#39;t using a hand sanitizer on your palm save your life?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—There&#39;s a lot of germs everywhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">......</p>
<p class="orv_line">—What happens if you kill yourself?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m going to tell you the &#39;second way.&#39;&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">*</p>
<p class="orv_line">rlaehrwk37: But does that really work?</p>
<hr>
[There are 16 minutes remaining.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Here&#39;s a lighter.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Clothes are made of fabric, so they&#39;ll burn fast, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter what it is, they&#39;re germs, they&#39;ll stick to it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">To execute the &#39;second way&#39;, people quickly obtained the supplies I asked for.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you sure this will work?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded gently and began stacking the bundles of old clothes people had collected in the center</p>
<p class="orv_line">of the station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Our plan was simple. If the bugs didn&#39;t work, we&#39;d kill something else. Something too small to</p>
<p class="orv_line">see that existed everywhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Deacon Kim Cheolyang asked with concern.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But do germs count? Aren&#39;t germs invisible?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;God is also invisible, isn&#39;t he?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Cheolyang seemed to get a little angry at my words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wondering if I had gone too far with the joke, I quickly added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;In biology class, we learn that bacteria are also living things. Even if you can&#39;t see it, it&#39;s still a</p>
<p class="orv_line">living thing.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could tell he wasn&#39;t convinced, so I explained a little more.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Think of it like aliens. There must be life on planets in the far universe, but we can&#39;t see them.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Brother, there are no aliens. Only pseudo-religions believes in that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Anyway, I&#39;m just giving you an example.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I see, so you&#39;re saying they&#39;re living things even if we can&#39;t see them.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded, but even I wasn&#39;t 100 percent convinced by this strategy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Does killing an invisible creature work to clear the scenario?</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, there is no clear answer to that even if you read the whole novel.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Monarch of the Small Fries&#39; is interested in your strategy.]</p></div>
[A few constellations wonder what you&#39;re trying to do.]</p></div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">However, there is a commonly accepted &#39;answer&#39; in all scenarios.</p>
「The one that will be interesting and convincing to the constellations.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I mutter to myself, staring at the ceiling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe it doesn&#39;t matter so much what you kill, but how it makes the person who observes it</p>
<p class="orv_line">feel.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe what we&#39;re killing is one of these germs.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my phone and showed him a list of the germs we were likely to kill and what they</p>
<p class="orv_line">looked like.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Germs that are always present in subway stations, but we&#39;ve never actually seen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Organisms you can&#39;t see with the naked eye, so you wouldn&#39;t normally care.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now people had to kill them to survive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I looked it up, and germs are actually living things.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This time we&#39;ll succeed, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, people&#39;s faces lit up a bit at the thought of a new breakthrough.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not everyone, of course.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;ve all lost your minds.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The big guy grumbled, glaring at me and the others as if he didn&#39;t like the situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But then he glanced away, and he opened his phone and began to surreptitiously search for</p>
<p class="orv_line">something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I peeked my head out to see what he was searching for.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—bacteria life</p>
<p class="orv_line">—insect life</p>
<p class="orv_line">—life</p>
<p class="orv_line">—athlete&#39;s foot</p>
<p class="orv_line">—propecia side effects</p>
<p class="orv_line">As he was excitedly perusing the list of search terms, reader ahjussi next to me whispered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Will this work? We won&#39;t be able to identify the germs we kill.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, we&#39;ll do what we can. Just because you can&#39;t find the bodies of the people you kill with</p>
<p class="orv_line">missiles doesn&#39;t mean you didn&#39;t kill them.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If we had an electron microscope, it would be possible to confirm the death of the bacteria</p>
<p class="orv_line">directly, but we didn&#39;t.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So for now, we had to do whatever we could.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If we can&#39;t see the bacteria, we have to at least do something that makes it clear that we intend to</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">kill them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That way, the constellations would understand what we were trying to do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Will burning really kill the germs? What if they don&#39;t die?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They&#39;re going to die. Why do you boil water? Because it sterilizes everything.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is that so?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Brothers, didn&#39;t you look it up earlier? You should know exactly how to kill them.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, deacon. We&#39;re old and don&#39;t know what you mean.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Cheolyang explained to them in frustration.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah, germs die because their proteins are denatured when they&#39;re heated, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced at Kim Cheolyang with a questioning glance, and he nodded wordlessly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A moment later, a small campfire blazed in the center of Geumho Station.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—rlaehrwk99: But by that logic, shouldn&#39;t you live because the bacteria in your stomach will die</p>
<p class="orv_line">even if you stay still?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—rlaehrwk24: The stomach is an involuntary muscle, so it&#39;s hard to say there was an intention to</p>
<p class="orv_line">kill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—rlaehrwk99 : Isn&#39;t it possible to kill by controlling the stomach with force?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—rlaehrwk24: The involuntary muscle is....</p>
<p class="orv_line">—rlaehrwk37: Yoo Joonghyuk would be able to control his stomach with force.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">People threw the bodies of dead bugs and other miscellaneous items they had into the fire.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Cheolyang threw his cell phone case into the fire, and reader ahjussi tore receipts from his</p>
<p class="orv_line">wallet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Others threw their shoes into the fire or pulled out their hair.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The big guy, who was wary of people, secretly took off his socks and threw them into the fire.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;My sock.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">No one brought up the last words of the big guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">10, 20......</p>
<p class="orv_line">The people stood still and watched the bonfire burn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sitting around the campfire with such a serious look in their eyes, it felt like we were at a</p>
<p class="orv_line">religious retreat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were praying to an invisible god, thinking about invisible germs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I did the same.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The invisible bacteria burned in the sacred flame.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were burning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I believed they were burning.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">However, imagining the death of unknown germs was as difficult as imagining the faces of</p>
<p class="orv_line">nameless readers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What happened to them?</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the reader ahjussi with his hands clasped together, muttering something, others must be alive</p>
<p class="orv_line">somewhere in this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judge Heewon who sat next to me in the theater, the girl who wondered if Kim Dokja was alive</p>
<p class="orv_line">or dead, the reader who knew the secret of 1,863, and the reader who memorized the number of</p>
<p class="orv_line">■.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">I closed my eyes and imagined them safely completing the first scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did anyone get a message or anything?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said, and they looked at each other. Eyes nervous, like worshippers waiting for a message from</p>
<p class="orv_line">God.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, there&#39;s something in front of me.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, God&#39;s message appeared in front of everyone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">scenario modification.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">expired.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone muttered in surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What the hell is this.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">No need to ask, the message was simple.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter what we do next, we won&#39;t know if the scenario is cleared until &#39;the end of the</p>
<p class="orv_line">scenario&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was stunned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No way, I didn&#39;t expect this from the administration.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was at that moment that a tsuchuchut went off in my head.</p>
[What the hell are you thinking?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The image of a tired face appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">germs...... You guys are causing the scenario system to crash. It&#39;s clogging up the message output</p>
<p class="orv_line">and won&#39;t let me preview the results!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging by what Bihyung said, the situation was not intended by the Bureau.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Meanwhile, people were also getting annoyed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What&#39;s up with that? We can&#39;t know if we&#39;ve passed this or not.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey, did we solve our scenario?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Bacterias are living things, right? Please answer me!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung frowned at the people.</p>
[That&#39;s.......]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Bihyung opened his mouth, sparks flew in the air once again.</p>
[The constellations of the &#39;absolute evil&#39; system warn the dokkaebi &#39;Bihyung&#39;.]</p></div>
[The constellations of the &#39;absolute good&#39; system warn the dokkaebi &#39;Bihyung&#39;.]</p></div>
[The constellations watching the scenario do not want the dokkaebi to intervene in the scenario.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Something doesn&#39;t feel right about this.</p>
[Hmm...... If the constellations say so.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung looked around at the incarnations with a frosty gaze.</p>
<p class="orv_line">service, I will tell you what will happen if you fail the scenario.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard that, I checked the timer.</p>
[There are 10 minutes remaining.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was time for &#39;that&#39; to show up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Author&#39;s Note</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thank you. There is one more.</p>
