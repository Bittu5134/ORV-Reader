<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">While people were confused, I thought and thought and thought.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If we couldn't use 'bugs' anymore, now I had to find a new answer.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The first thing I did was to open my phone and check the comments on the 'first episode' of</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Omniscient Reader.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—If a bug works out, what about bacterias? Bacterias are living things.</p>

<p class="orv_line">—Doesn't stomach acid kill bacteria even if you don't move? Doesn't that mean you can survive</p>

<p class="orv_line">—Ah, that's ridiculous.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There are 16 minutes remaining.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Here's a lighter."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Clothes are made of fabric, so they'll burn fast, right?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It doesn't matter what it is, they're germs, they'll stick to it."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">To execute the 'second way', people quickly obtained the supplies I asked for.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you sure this will work?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded gently and began stacking the bundles of old clothes people had collected in the center</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">of the station.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Our plan was simple. If the bugs didn't work, we'd kill something else. Something too small to</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">see that existed everywhere.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Deacon Kim Cheolyang asked with concern.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"But do germs count? Aren't germs invisible?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"God is also invisible, isn't he?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Cheolyang seemed to get a little angry at my words.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Wondering if I had gone too far with the joke, I quickly added.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"In biology class, we learn that bacteria are also living things. Even if you can't see it, it's still a</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">living thing."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I could tell he wasn't convinced, so I explained a little more.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Think of it like aliens. There must be life on planets in the far universe, but we can't see them."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Brother, there are no aliens. Only pseudo-religions believes in that."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Anyway, I'm just giving you an example."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I see, so you're saying they're living things even if we can't see them."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded, but even I wasn't 100 percent convinced by this strategy.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Does killing an invisible creature work to clear the scenario?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, there is no clear answer to that even if you read the whole novel.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' is interested in your strategy.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A few constellations wonder what you're trying to do.]</p></div>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">However, there is a commonly accepted 'answer' in all scenarios.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The one that will be interesting and convincing to the constellations. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I mutter to myself, staring at the ceiling.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Maybe it doesn't matter so much what you kill, but how it makes the person who observes it</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">feel."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Maybe what we're killing is one of these germs."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my phone and showed him a list of the germs we were likely to kill and what they</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">looked like.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Germs that are always present in subway stations, but we've never actually seen.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Organisms you can't see with the naked eye, so you wouldn't normally care.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Now people had to kill them to survive.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I looked it up, and germs are actually living things."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"This time we'll succeed, right?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Still, people's faces lit up a bit at the thought of a new breakthrough.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Not everyone, of course.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"You've all lost your minds."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The big guy grumbled, glaring at me and the others as if he didn't like the situation.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">But then he glanced away, and he opened his phone and began to surreptitiously search for</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">something.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I peeked my head out to see what he was searching for.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—bacteria life</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—insect life</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—life</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—athlete's foot</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—propecia side effects</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As he was excitedly perusing the list of search terms, reader ahjussi next to me whispered.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Will this work? We won't be able to identify the germs we kill."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, we'll do what we can. Just because you can't find the bodies of the people you kill with</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">missiles doesn't mean you didn't kill them."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If we had an electron microscope, it would be possible to confirm the death of the bacteria</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">directly, but we didn't.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">So for now, we had to do whatever we could.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If we can't see the bacteria, we have to at least do something that makes it clear that we intend to</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">kill them.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">That way, the constellations would understand what we were trying to do.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Will burning really kill the germs? What if they don't die?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"They're going to die. Why do you boil water? Because it sterilizes everything."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Is that so?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Brothers, didn't you look it up earlier? You should know exactly how to kill them."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, deacon. We're old and don't know what you mean."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Cheolyang explained to them in frustration.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah, germs die because their proteins are denatured when they're heated, right?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced at Kim Cheolyang with a questioning glance, and he nodded wordlessly.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A moment later, a small campfire blazed in the center of Geumho Station.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—rlaehrwk99: But by that logic, shouldn't you live because the bacteria in your stomach will die</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">even if you stay still?</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—rlaehrwk24: The stomach is an involuntary muscle, so it's hard to say there was an intention to</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">kill.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—rlaehrwk99 : Isn't it possible to kill by controlling the stomach with force?</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—rlaehrwk24: The involuntary muscle is....</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—rlaehrwk37: Yoo Joonghyuk would be able to control his stomach with force.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">People threw the bodies of dead bugs and other miscellaneous items they had into the fire.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Cheolyang threw his cell phone case into the fire, and reader ahjussi tore receipts from his</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">wallet.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Others threw their shoes into the fire or pulled out their hair.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The big guy, who was wary of people, secretly took off his socks and threw them into the fire.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"My sock......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">No one brought up the last words of the big guy.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">10, 20......</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The people stood still and watched the bonfire burn.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Sitting around the campfire with such a serious look in their eyes, it felt like we were at a</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">religious retreat.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">They were praying to an invisible god, thinking about invisible germs.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I did the same.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The invisible bacteria burned in the sacred flame.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">They were burning.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I believed they were burning.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">However, imagining the death of unknown germs was as difficult as imagining the faces of</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">nameless readers.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">What happened to them?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As the reader ahjussi with his hands clasped together, muttering something, others must be alive</p>

<p class="orv_line">"Did anyone get a message or anything?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I said, and they looked at each other. Eyes nervous, like worshippers waiting for a message from</p>

<p class="orv_line">God.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, there's something in front of me......."</p>

<p class="orv_line">No need to ask, the message was simple.</p>

<p class="orv_line">No matter what we do next, we won't know if the scenario is cleared until 'the end of the</p>

<p class="orv_line">scenario'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I was stunned.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">No way, I didn't expect this from the administration.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was at that moment that a tsuchuchut went off in my head.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Judging by what Bihyung said, the situation was not intended by the Bureau.</p>
