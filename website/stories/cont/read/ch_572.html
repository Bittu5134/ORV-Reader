<p class="orv_line">woken up yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I have no choice but to try to talk my way out of this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, there were many repertoires that could be used if the opponent was Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the early stages, Yoo Joonghyuk is a bit of a fool, so I might be able to get out of the situation</p>
<p class="orv_line">by claiming to be a prophet like Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Answer me, why are you hanging around in this place?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the moment I heard those words, I felt something strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">First, I noticed the weapon in his hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A spear that looked like it was carved from the bones of a monster species.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I felt goosebumps.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「3rd round Yoo Joonghyuk doesn&#x27;t use a spear.」</div>「3rd round Yoo Joonghyuk doesn't use a spear.」</p>

<p>An endless list of skills.</p>
<p>However, that&#x27;s not what surprised me.</p>
<p>The moment I saw Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s &#x27;attributes&#x27; and &#x27;Regressor&#x27; on the list, my head turned blank.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「How the hell could this happen?」</p>
<p>There was only one thought in my head.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「If I stay here, I&#x27;ll die.」</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>&quot;You must have met Anna Croft in the Chungmuro Tunnel. You recalled the memories of the</p>
<p>last round.......&quot;</p>
<p>I stared at Yoo Joonghyuk, dumbfounded.</p>
<p>What was he talking about?</p>
<p>&quot;Cheon Inho, why are you here? If you remembered, you would have remembered the promise</p>
<p>we made.&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, my head was spinning.</p>
<p>What the hell is this guy talking about?</p>
<p>When I didn&#x27;t answer, Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s expression hardened slightly.</p>
<p>&quot;Why did you come looking for me? Are you unhappy with our promise now?&quot;</p>
<p>It was a major crisis.</p>
<p>There was no mention of this development anywhere in Omniscient Reader. The same was true</p>
<p>for &#x27;Ways of Survival&#x27;.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[You want to do something unexpected.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The activation conditions for the exclusive skill &#x27;□□&#x27; has been met.]</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you can, you should experiment with all your options. Moreover, if your opponent is &#x27;Yoo</p>
<p>Joonghyuk&#x27;.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Your creativity is currently depleted and you can&#x27;t enter the &#x27;Snowfield&#x27;.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[You can take a penalty and enter the Snowfield once more.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[If you make an additional entry, you will no longer be able to enter today.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Do you want to enter the &#x27;Snowfield&#x27;?]</p>
<p>For a moment, I was worried.</p>
<p>Is this the last one of the day?</p>
<p>&#x27;I&#x27;m not entering.&#x27;</p>
<p>In the end, I canceled the skill.</p>
<p>There could be a bigger crisis than this, I couldn&#x27;t risk it hastily.</p>
<p>I had to trust my high level eloquence for now.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath and began my story.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think I came here for that appointment?&quot;</p>
<p>I could feel him pause for a moment. Whether he did or not, I acted shamelessly.</p>
<p>&quot;I was just looking around to see if there was any items to pick up nearby. How naive of you to</p>
<p>think I&#x27;d come to see you first.&quot;</p>
<p>As I said this, I rummaged through the body of the dead poisonous rhinoceros.</p>
<p>The poisonous rhinoceros was a 7th grade monster.</p>
<p>If I could get a piece of its body now, it would be very useful in the early stages.</p>
<p>&quot;You.......&quot;</p>
<p>I turned my head at the sound of the voice and saw Yoo Joonghyuk looking down at me with</p>
<p>disdain.</p>
<p>But why? Contempt is definitely contempt.</p>
<p>&quot;No matter how many rounds I do, your trashy behavior doesn&#x27;t change.&quot;</p>
<p>He was smiling strangely.</p>
<p>I felt my hopes rise a little.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m flattered.&quot;</p>
<p>As I began to cut off the tiny horn of the poisonous rhinoceros, Yoo Joonghyuk protested.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s mine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can keep the tiny horn.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;Have you always been greedy for things like this?&quot;</p>
<p>I felt hurt for a moment, but the water was already spilled anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not as strong from the beginning as someone.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk gave me a strange look.</p>
<p>&quot;This round is really weird. That happened in the first scenario too........&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What happened?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;None of your business.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What happened to Lee Hyunsung and Kim Namwoon? Why didn&#x27;t they come with you?&quot;</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s eyes turned cold at my questions.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t think too much of yourself, Cheon Inho, do you really think we&#x27;re colleagues or</p>
<p>something? I&#x27;m sure you didn&#x27;t forgot what happened last round.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#x27;m confused.</p>
<p>We made a promise, and now he says we&#x27;re not colleagues.</p>
<p>What is our relationship then?</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t forget what you&#x27;re supposed to do. Don&#x27;t make me regret hiring a scumbag like you.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk glared at me with a scary look, and I couldn&#x27;t help but widen my eyes.</p>
<p>Even narrow eyes can be open wide.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks for the rant.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re even more loudmouthed than last round. Stop procrastinating and go back. You have</p>
<p>work to do.&quot;</p>
<p>With those words, Yoo Joonghyuk gathered up several key parts of the &#x27;poisonous rhinoceros&#x27;</p>
<p>and turned back toward the tunnel.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t come looking for me until you&#x27;ve sorted out what I ordered you to do. Next time you</p>
<p>wander around, I&#x27;ll kill you.&quot;</p>
<p>I watched Yoo Joonghyuk walk away, step by step, and somehow it didn&#x27;t feel real.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「I survived.」</p>
<p>Relief washed over me.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know why, but I survived. I had succeeded in fooling that &#x27;Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27; safely.</p>
<p>It was then that I heard a rustling sound from the side. Jung Heewon, who suddenly came to her</p>
<p>senses, was sitting up a few steps away from me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;Ouch, it hurts. Inho-ssi. Are you okay? Did you get hurt?&quot;</p>
<p>In a moment of panic, I quickly rushed toward her. Through the thick dust, the sound of Yoo</p>
<p>Joonghyuk&#x27;s footsteps stopped.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s weird.&quot;</p>
<p>I felt my heart drop.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m sure it wasn&#x27;t part of your plan to take such a woman with you.&quot;</p>
<p>Goosebumps spread from head to toe. Standing over the ruins, Yoo Joonghyuk stared at me with</p>
<p>cold eyes.</p>
<p>I tried my best to hide my panic.</p>
<p>&quot;What does it matter who I take with me?&quot;</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Yoo Joonghyuk started walking back toward me.</p>
<p>An ominous feeling crept up on me. I instinctively felt a sense of crisis.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[You want to do something unexpected.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Describe your own behavior.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[You have spent 5 probability points.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The activation conditions for the exclusive skill &#x27;⬜⬜&#x27; have been met.]</p>
<p>My writer sense was telling me. I must use it now. If I fail to overcome this crisis, I will die.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[You have exhausted the number of additional entrances to the &#x27;Snowfield&#x27;.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[You will get a probability penalty.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[You have entered the &#x27;Snowfield&#x27;.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Describe the next action of &#x27;Cheon Inho&#x27;.]</p>

<p></p>
<p>The title of the scene was terrible.</p>
<p>&#x27;Cheon Inho&#x27;s Death&#x27;.</p>
<p>I quickly began to write a sentence. Roughly, it was about Cheon Inho convincing Yoo</p>
<p>Joonghyuk with his amazing speech, overcoming the crisis and becoming his colleague.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[This story is very unlikely.]</p>

<p>As I was writing this, I realized that this line could work, because it&#x27;s exactly what Kim Dokja</p>

<p>&lt;!&gt;[The Snowfield begins to doubt your talent.]</p>

<p>Maybe this is the end of a Lee Hakhyun&#x27;s life.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[There are 10 seconds remaining.]</p>
<p>I remembered Ji Eunyoo&#x27;s advice one last time.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「Now, what does Yoo Joonghyuk want?」</p>
<p>I closed my eyes and thought about it. And I realized.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Failed to recreate the scene.]</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no way I could know that. I can&#x27;t even understand what he&#x27;s saying right now, so how can</p>
<p>I know what he wants?</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Leaving the &#x27;Snowfield&#x27;.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Your creativity has been exhausted. You can no longer enter the &#x27;Snowfield&#x27; today.]</p>
<p>The colors returned to the world, and Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s steps began to move again.</p>
<p>I swallowed and kept an eye on the situation. I had failed to recreate the scene, but I wasn&#x27;t ready</p>
<p>to give up yet.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of weirdos this round, right from the start.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s dismal voice echoed through the cold night air.</p>
<p>&quot;They were nothing until the last round, but they all suddenly came up to me and said strange</p>
<p>things as if they were possessed.&quot;</p>
<p>I thought I knew what Yoo Joonghyuk was talking about now.</p>
<p>Wait. No way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;They said that I needed a companion to break through the 46th scenario, or that they were</p>
<p>prophets.&quot;</p>
<p>A cold sweat began to run down my back.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk was smiling with a strange expression.</p>
<p>&quot;There was also one who said he would take me to the end of the world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Inho-ssi, step back.&quot;</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, who noticed something was strange, stood in front of me, holding the ground rat</p>
<p>knife.</p>
<p>The next moment, Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s figure disappeared.</p>
<p>The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, and I heard the sound of wind blowing in the</p>
<p>distance. It was as if the Grim Reaper was speaking to me from the darkness. It was the</p>
<p>implacable language of death that I could not answer.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The character &#x27;Jung Heewon&#x27; has used &#x27;Kendo Lv.1&#x27;!]</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Jung Heewon answered him.</p>
<p>A creaking sound was heard in front of her, and dazzling sparks burst out in all directions.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon&#x27;s sword, which received Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s spear, was trembling precariously.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re good at Kendo. You&#x27;re a similar type as Lee Jihye.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Inho-ssi! Who is this person?&quot;</p>
<p>As I looked at the blood dripping from Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s spear pole, I had an eerie feeling.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask him, what happened to all those &#x27;prophets&#x27; you met?</p>
<p>&quot;Cheon Inho.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk turned to me.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you really Cheon Inho?&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The character &#x27;Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27; has used &#x27;Lie Detection Lv.7&#x27;!]</p>
<p>His [Lie Detection] is level 7.</p>
<p>Perhaps, this was my last chance.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The exclusive skill &#x27;Incite Lv.3&#x27; is strongly activated!]</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「I am Cheon Inho.」</p>
<p>In other words, as long as the acting was perfect, there was a possibility of deceiving it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;If I&#x27;m not Cheon Inho, then who the hell is Cheon Inho. What are you doing?&quot;</p>
<p>My heart was pounding.</p>
<p>And after a while,</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The character &#x27;Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27; has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p>
<p>That&#x27;s it. He&#x27;ll have no choice but to believe me.</p>
<p>However, Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s expression was strange.</p>
<p>&quot;[Lie Detection] isn&#x27;t always perfect, in the previous round you lied to me without using [Poker</p>
<p>Face].&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;.......&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cheon Inho. What was the first thing you decided to do?&quot;</p>
<p>I was speechless for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;That.&quot;</p>
<p>If I made a mistake here, I could be caught by [Lie Detection].</p>
<p>Should I use [Incite] once more? Or—</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk looked at me with an unreadable gaze and said.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll give you a chance.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s spear instantly flashed, sending Jung Heewon&#x27;s sword flying into the air.</p>
<p>Just as Jung Heewon reached out to grab the sword in surprise, Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s spear moved</p>
<p>once more.</p>
<p>The fight was quick to end.</p>
<p>Blood gushed from both her knees, and Jung Heewon, who lost her balance, fell forward.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s left hand moved.</p>
<p>&quot;Keok.&quot;</p>
<p>He lifted Jung Heewon&#x27;s neck and moved to the end of the bridge.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk looked back in my direction and said.</p>
<p>&quot;What I need is the great villain Cheon Inho, &#x27;The One Who Deceived the Stars&#x27;, the &#x27;Evil</p>
<p>Sophist&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know why Cheon Inho had such grandioses nicknames, but Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s purpose was</p>
<p>clear.</p>
<p>&quot;If you&#x27;re really the &#x27;Cheon Inho&#x27; I know, prove it.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s left hand moved slowly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jung Heewon&#x27;s complexion turned pale as she struggled. Beneath her feet, the hell road of the</p>
<p>Han River, where the ichthyosaur passed, unfolded.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Is this woman your colleague?&quot;</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk was testing me now.</p>
<p>Was I really the &#x27;Cheon Inho&#x27; he remembered?</p>
<p>Jung Heewon was looking at me with trembling eyes.</p>
<p>Perhaps, there was only one way to save her now.</p>
<p>I slowly closed my eyes and opened them again. The cold night air rushed into my lungs, and for</p>
<p>a moment, I felt like a different person.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The exclusive skill &#x27;Incite Lv.3&#x27; is strongly activated!]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The synchronization rate with the possessed target is increasing rapidly!]</p>
<p>&quot;Let me make one thing clear.&quot;</p>
<p>I said with my trademark mean smile, whispering the secret.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t have any colleagues.&quot;</p>
<p>Deep disappointment flashed through Jung Heewon&#x27;s eyes as she looked at me.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s definitely Cheon Inho.&quot;</p>
<p>I let out a breath of relief.</p>
<p>This was the right answer.</p>
<p>I was sure it was.</p>
<p>&quot;Then it wouldn&#x27;t matter if this woman died.&quot;</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s hand opened wide, and Jung Heewon&#x27;s body fell down.</p>
<p>I focused all my strength into my legs and flew toward her.</p>
<p>&quot;As expected, you aren&#x27;t Cheon Inho.&quot;</p>
<p>The world spun, and Jung Heewon and I began to plummet down the bridge.</p>
<p>The chilly breeze scratched my cheeks, and I could smell the fishy odor of water.</p>
<p>I looked up at the dizzying sight and saw Yoo Joonghyuk looking down at us from the bridge.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Release your hand and get lost, you son of a bitch.</p>
<p>The next thing I know, the cold water of the Han River assaulted my senses, and my vision</p>
<p>turned black with shock.</p>
<p>And then a message came in.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The dokkaebi &#x27;Bihyung&#x27; has agreed to a &#x27;Stream Contract&#x27; with you.]</p>
<p>Author&#x27;s Note</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t let go of that hand...</p>
