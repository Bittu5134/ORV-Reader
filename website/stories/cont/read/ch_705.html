            <div class="orv_title"><h1>705 Episode 26 Star Ladder (1)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">With Yoo Jonghyuk's roar, the atmosphere of the battlefield changed. The frightened incarnations began to leave the battlefield one by one.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Someone uses the 'star ladder'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Someone uses the 'star ladder'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This scenario was a 'sub-scenario' and did not necessarily need to be cleared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait a minute, you guys—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because they didn't come here to protect Washington in the first place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m sorry, Prophet."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the allies she trusted disappeared one by one, Anna Croft's expression became anxious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'star ladder' in the sky continued to emit bright light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Anna."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Selena Kim and Christina stood by her side. Her colleagues also knew that there was no chance of victory at this rate.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna and Zarathustra's elites have already completed the subjugation of the 4 grade disaster species. They could also use that star ladder if they wanted to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, Anna did not leave the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If she abandons Washington, America will collapse. The invasion of the demon world will continue and eventually hit Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the representative of 'Zarathustra', she had a duty to protect this continent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Cheon Inho."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft looked at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was so desperate that she had to resort to her least favorite scammer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will stop it. Instead—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">So, now was the only time for the scammer to set a 'condition'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Please lend me some of your skills."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Which..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know you have the 'Elixir Maker' trait."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The real reason I came to see Anna Croft.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took out the ´Lesser Dragon Heart' from her arms. A reward obtained from defeating a 4th grade earth dragon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, because the processing process for Dragon Heart is so complicated, there is currently only one way to refine it into an elixir.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I need your blood."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is to mix it with the blood of the 'elixir manufacturer'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A startled Anna Croft stared at me closely and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You know what happens if you drink my blood."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will become a member of your household."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said this, recalling Kim Dokja from the third round, who was revived after drinking Anna's blood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But that’s when I’m of a lower rank than you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you saying your level is higher than mine now?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Certainly, when I looked at me now, I was insignificant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I do not have a solid embodiment like Yoo Jonghyuk, nor does I have powerful mental skills like Nirvana.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I do not lead a powerful group like Anna, nor do she have a sponsor that everyone knows about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there is one thing I am confident about.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is hungry.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'Stories.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How can you—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna's eyes widened as she sensed the story flowing from my body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It has to be that way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because I have already collected three stories. And exactly in those three stories, there was a clear difference in class between me and the other incarnations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We don’t have time. What are you going to do?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft still seemed hesitant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fact that her 'blood' is an elixir is still a top secret. The moment this fact is revealed, incarnations from all over the world will target her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So for her to display this ability in front of me now was already a gamble.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna, who was worried, eventually received the Dragon Heart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It will take about 5 minutes. You are confident, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stepped in front of her with my back to Anna.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Of course."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk, trampling on  Nirvana, was crying towards the sky.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The attribute 'Cyclic Delay' is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly took a breath and circulated the magical energy throughout my body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Youngest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Yes. Is it possible now?'</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint’s cooldown has already ended.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint 'Stage 3' is in effect!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was probability.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint was at level 3, it was not completely free from the influence of probability.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Is it possible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it's different now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew it instinctively.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Like when Yamata no Orochi descended on [Peace Land], the 'probability aftermaths' do not blow in their normal form in this scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, this scenario works by putting each other's status on the 'scale' and canceling out each other's probabilities.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 This time, we may be able to use the true power of the 'Demon King of Salvation'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I activated [Incite] at the right time.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I am Kim Dokja. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Incite' goes hand in hand with 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The synchronization rate with the sponsor is increasing!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It feels like a layer of film is being placed on my soul, like wearing hard yet soft clothes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I slowly blinked, the scenery of the world changed. The high sky became even lower, and the gaze of the constellations felt more blatant.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some constellations are surprised by your status! ]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the National Tree pay homage to your status .]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Bald General' is surprised as to whether you actually have hidden powers.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is looking closely at your story.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' looks at you with his eyes wide open.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Christina, who was standing a few steps away, stumbled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As for her, if she really is an 'apostle', she will have no choice but to recognize who is possessing me now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"As expected of you…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, Yoo Joonghyuk looked this way. The moment our eyes met, I knew the bastard would move.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Come, Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time as control of the body was transferred to Kim Dokja, 'Unbreakable Faith' flashed in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk's flying front foot and the brilliantly rising 'Blade of Faith' collided with each other.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Coo coo coo coo!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blade and forepaw collided and a loud noise erupted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was taking the attack from that monstrous beast.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Woah! Are you that surprised? Even if I look like this, I am fable grade'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realize it again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That playful 'neighborhood brother' is actually a shining 'constellation' in the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I cannot properly use even 10% of my power in this incarnation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be exact, even that '10%' was difficult.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The muscles of my entire body were screaming, and I could feel my magic power quickly depleting in real time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The decision will be made within 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The tale began to tell its story on Kim Dokja’s behalf.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'King of a Kingless World' begins its storytelling !]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The first story obtained by Kim Dokja, the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 No king under the heavens of this world can call himself true. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 'King of a Kingless World' was declaring to the 'Supreme King'.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Only the king who denies the king will exist. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The power of the story exploded and I kicked the ground and ran. I felt confident that I could cut down anything that got in my way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Blade of Faith’ expanded explosively.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For the first time, a hint of confusion appeared in the eyes of that scary beast.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sugagak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The cut off black fur fluttered in the air and blood splattered. Yoo Jonghyuk's stance, which was focused on attack, was changing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A cautious defensive stance centered on [Strong Self-Defense].</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that brief moment, the beast made a decision. This 'story' cannot be used for very long.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Is it smart?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even Yoo Jonghyuk was instinctively suppressing the story of the 'Supreme King'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if he knew that the moment he used that story, 'King of Kingless World' would be used.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All he uses are 'beast' techniques that rely solely on instinct.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I don’t know if Yoo Jonghyuk is smart or if the demon possessing him is smart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story of 'King of a Kingless World' was spreading in real time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As he expected, my incarnation body could not maintain the power of a legendary story for long.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'What should I do now?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—We have to use other means.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Other means?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I was about to ask what else there was, a message rang in my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A sigh flowed from within.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is the technology that made 'Kim Dokja' into a 'reader'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He defeated numerous enemies with this technique and absorbed their power as his own.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In my head, I ran through a list of countless characters that Kim Dokja had read about so far.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some characters I knew, some I didn't even know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some characters were too weak to be appropriate for use at the moment, while others were so strong that it was impossible to know if probability would allow it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—There are people to choose from.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there was no hesitation in Kim Dokja's choice.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Bookmark number 11 has been activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">—If this guy is the '41st round', there is someone who must be chosen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like the magical energy in my whole body was shaking violently and I got goosebumps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized who I had become.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The pure white coat was covered with white fur. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I never thought I would see this scenery with my own eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Bookmark number 11 'Disaster of Floods Shin Yoosoung' is activated!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Beast King’s Sensitivity Lv.???'  is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">White fur fluttering like white snow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk's pupils wavered as he looked this way. Even someone with only instincts would have noticed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how strong the beast-turned-guy is, he can't defeat me now.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I am the 'Beast Lord'." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung, the Disaster of Floods.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "King of all 'monsters'." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja rushed over in an instant and hit Yoo Jonghyuk on the head with the side of the blade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One shot, two shots, three shots.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though it seemed like an attack that could be easily avoided, Yoo Jonghyuk could not avoid it. Like a subject who cannot disobey the king's orders.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Every time Yoo Jonghyuk's head was hit, 41st Shin Yoosoung's story was told.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "What on earth were we to the captain?" 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I hate you for living alone in this world." 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I will end your world in the most horrific way." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">No matter what anyone says, they cannot say that this pain is a lie.</p>
<p class="orv_line">41st round Shin Yoosoung's very existence was the crime of 41st round Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if receiving punishment for his crime, Kim Dokja delivered a powerful kick to Yoo Jonghyuk's stomach.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk flew about ten meters and fell, breaking the window of the National Assembly building.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Ahjussi… Can I call you that too?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Kim Dokja heard that voice again, he stopped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Whose memory is this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung, or Shin Yoosoung in the 41st round?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Or not,</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Are you okay?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this a memory of Kim Dokja, who was the 'Demon King of Salvation'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—What if I’m not okay?</p>
<p class="orv_line">For the first time, I felt a certain emotion in Kim Dokja's voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He spoke like a person who does not want to let go of those emotions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Isn't it okay to say that I miss her when I miss her?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why is he so cold? Was the Kim Dokja I knew really that kind of person?</p>
<p class="orv_line">No.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At least the 'Demon King of Salvation' I know is...</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Because that’s not my 'role'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Role?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It’s up to the other 'Kim Dokja' to feel sad when he sees people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard those words, all my questions suddenly seemed to make sense.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When he first saw Jung Heewon, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Jihye, and Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason why the words Kim Dokja used to call them felt somehow distant and unfamiliar, could not be—</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Why is that?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Any Kim Dokja has the right to be sad. It's nice to see someone you like and you can call them in a friendly way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">You can talk about your feelings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But he didn't do that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Because I am the 'first Kim, Dokja Kim'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja was looking at Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk, the beast that rose up from inside the Capitol, ran screaming.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He said, "Kim Dokja likes 'Ways of Survival'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">If seen from afar, it would have looked like black and white monsters swinging their claws at each other.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Kim Dokja is more cold-hearted than anyone else. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the moment when Yoo Joonghyuk's claws caught on the tip of the fur of the 'Beast King's sensitivity', 'Unbreakable Faith' radiated light.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Kim Dokja, who hates losses and hates constellations. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk stumbled after being hit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja pushed forward without giving him any time to rest.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 In order for all other 'Kim Dokjas' to exist, Kim Dokja had to survive before anyone else. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk, who was on the defensive, activated his skill.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Pacheonyuseonggyeol.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The strongest skill that Yoo Jonghyuk can use now was revealed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A bundle of force that tears the world apart poured towards me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Kim’Dokja chose to become the Demon King to save someone. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja was not embarrassed and slowly opened his arms. As if embracing a shattered world.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Monster Gate' is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Dozens of portals swirled in the air, and disaster-level monster species popped out at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The various breaths that poured out from the mouth of the monster species offset the bundle of strong energy of the broken meteor shower.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 He is the 'Demon King of Salvation'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As he slowly approached, a feeling of fear appeared in the black beast's pupils.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja smiled faintly, as if to appease Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’ll just take what’s mine back."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Kim Dokja fragment' that was stuck in Yoo Jonghyuk’s back was pulled out along with blood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And at that very moment, the forgotten memories of the 'Demon King of Salvation' returned.</p>
