<p class="orv_line">Christina pursed her lips and continued speaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I had to make decisions quickly,&quot; she said. &quot;Too many people died before we even got to the fifth scenario.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">How did she manage to get to the fifth scenario?</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the apostles who knew the ending of this story knew that if the scenarios continued like this, everything would go wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ultimate resolution of the scenarios were impossible in this world line where Kim Dokja does not exist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how well they clear the previous scenarios, they will end up frustrated in front of the &#x27;Final Wall&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So they decided to take a risk in the fifth scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Summoning the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; with the &#x27;Disaster Summoning Rights&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it was called crazy, it was a choice that I had nothing to say about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What were you going to do if you failed?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Besides, even if you succeed, it’s still a problem.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; had been summoned as a disaster, something truly absurd could have happened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, I could not find fault with the readers’ heart for looking for Kim Dokja at the most desperate moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it&#x27;s because I too had a similar experience like them.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;I will sign a contract behind the scenes.&quot;」</div>「"I will sign a contract behind the scenes."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just like searching for God, anyone who knows Kim Dokja&#x27;s name has no choice but to find him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is probably the same for all readers who came to this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked, looking down at Anna Croft, who was sleeping soundly on Christina&#x27;s lap.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;She was [hypnotized], so Anna doesn’t know the details of the situation.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft is the most cautious character in &#x27;Ways of Survival&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is no way she would suddenly agree to summoning a being that she has never heard of or seen, the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27;, as a disaster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, Christina and the apostles hypnotized Anna and they secretly summoned the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In return, the &#x27;Washington Dome&#x27; became a demon realm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;At first, we were planning to do whatever we could to stop it. We gathered all the apostles in America and headed to the Washington Dome. That happened a few weeks ago.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It would not have been possible to honestly say that Washington was destroyed because of their choices.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To make up for their mistakes, the apostles attempted to attack the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You failed.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;…Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is that why you brought me here?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m ashamed.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Christina must have thought the moment she confirmed my sponsor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; they were looking for was already in this world line, and maybe that&#x27;s why their &#x27;summoning&#x27; failed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is there really a &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; in this world? Is there a &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27; we know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is there a &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27; they know in this world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a moment and answered like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There is a friend who is much more real than the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; over there. What on earth is the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; over there?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t know. What’s certain is that he wasn’t the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; that we know. And…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The Demon King continued to grow stronger every time the apostles visited.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did he continue to get stronger every time the apostles visited him?</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a theory that came to mind, but I wasn&#x27;t sure yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I have one person who can confirm all these hypotheses.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Kim-ssi.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This guy said he was going to exchange coins, but where on earth did he go?</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, with a chirping sound, &#x27;Midday Tryst&#x27; was reconnected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;No, where did you go and why are you coming back only now?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Youngest, I’m in big trouble.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;A big problem happened here too.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was trying to explain what incredible things have happened while he was away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However,</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I think my modifier was stolen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed like something really big had happened over there too.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Everything in the &lt;Star Stream&gt; is a &#x27;story&#x27;, that is, a &#x27;tale&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, since the concept of &#x27;tale&#x27; seemed so abstract, &#x27;currency&#x27;, a practical processing of it, appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is the story of the &#x27;coin&#x27; we know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Constellations spend coins just by breathing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Do constellations need to breathe?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It means that coins are consumed just by existing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;I know, but I didn&#x27;t know that it costs money to maintain a modifier.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since Kim Dokja never mentioned it once, I never thought about it either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I never thought it would cost coins just by using a modifier. Is that why the constellations have always been keen on earning coins?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;But are you saying that your constellation modifier has been taken away?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Not a constellation modifier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Are you sure?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I also have a Demon King modifier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to Kim Dokja&#x27;s claim, constellations that suddenly came from other &#x27;world lines&#x27; like Kim Dokja had to pay additional fees to use the &lt;Star Stream&gt; system.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Kim Dokja was both a &#x27;constellation&#x27; and a Demon King, so the cost of maintaining the modifier was doubled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;How did you maintain the constellation modifier, but you couldn’t pay the cost of maintaining the Demon King modifier?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered why this person was so obsessed with &#x27;coins&#x27;…</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I was thinking of exchanging some of the story fragments and monster parts I got this time and buying the modifier again... but the management bureau had already sold off my Demon King modifier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly I felt like I knew how things were going.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I briefly explained to Kim Dokja about the events that occurred in the United States.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When he heard the story about the apostles of the American continent and the &#x27;right to summon disaster&#x27;, Kim Dokja let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Oh, that was the spam message from the administration. They said it was a disaster blah blah blah.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It looks like he didn&#x27;t even read the management bureau&#x27;s message.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Then the Demon King of Salvation who is currently in Washington...&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It’s probably the new &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; that the Management Bureau has found.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;This is the guy who bought the Demon King&#x27;s nickname.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; currently in Washington is a counterfeit, &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; in name only.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Is he also a &#x27;Demon King&#x27;?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It won’t be at the level of a Demon King. Because they have a lot of pride, they don&#x27;t steal and use other people&#x27;s modifiers. He&#x27;s probably a demon trying to use this opportunity to ascend to the throne of the Demon King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter what the guy&#x27;s identity was, for now I had no choice but to head to Washington.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had Christina wake Anna up and explain what was needed. Anna Croft looked very embarrassed, but she quickly calmly accepted the situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m angry, but I can’t help it. I’ll take strict action for this later, Christina.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m sorry, Anna.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Please swear an [Oath of Existence]. You will never [Hypnotize] me again.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I swear.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna did not press Christina any further. Maybe it&#x27;s because she knows that persecuting her now won&#x27;t solve her situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna had her artisans bring the completed &#x27;4th grade Earth Dragon&#x27; equipment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You’ve caused trouble. Cheon Inho, let’s leave right away.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">After completing preparations, we immediately opened the portal to the &#x27;Washington Dome&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the situation got to this point, I too became confused.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Are my companions still safe?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What happened to Yoo Jonghyuk, who met a marquis-level demon species?</p>
<p class="orv_line">How strong is the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; in the Washington Dome?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I sort out my complicated thoughts and stepped into the portal.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Someone has killed the ruler of &#x27;Washington East&#x27;.]</div>[Someone has killed the ruler of 'Washington East'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">A message was heard.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The &#x27;demon&#x27; had no name.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are a 7th grade demon species &#x27;Dark Sentinel&#x27;.]</div>[You are a 7th grade demon species 'Dark Sentinel'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">He, like most other demon species, existed only as a part of a scenario designed by dokkaebis. Killing the incarnations that come to the &#x27;Treasure Storehouse of the Earth River Lord&#x27; and offering their souls to the demon kings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The demon had no complaints about it. Just as gopher rats never question their breathing, breathing black ether, and collecting treasures, he also never once questioned his work.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The whole incident started with him killing some humans who were hiding in his &#x27;treasure warehouse&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;It is the Keeper of Darkness!&quot;」</div>「"It is the Keeper of Darkness!"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;It’s true. It’s just like the novel.&quot;」</div>「"It’s true. It’s just like the novel."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">He dealt with the incarnations as usual. Attack using tentacles.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But surprisingly, the duo skillfully repelled his attack.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Through! Kim Dokja&#x27;s method works! Push on!&quot;」</div>「"Through! Kim Dokja's method works! Push on!"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;If you attack the left ankle, the upper right tentacle moves!&quot;」</div>「"If you attack the left ankle, the upper right tentacle moves!"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not only did humans know his attack patterns, but they also used weapons with &#x27;divine attributes&#x27; to which he was vulnerable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He screamed every time his tentacles were cut.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;It’s over! Finish it!&quot;」</div>「"It’s over! Finish it!"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking back, if he had been an ordinary &#x27;dark sentinel&#x27;, he certainly would not have been able to withstand the attacks of that duo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the duo was unlucky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The period of time he lived as a &#x27;Dark Sentinel&#x27; was a little longer than other &#x27;Dark Sentinels&#x27;, and because of that, he was able to display a little more wisdom in battle than other entities.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When he pretended to be weak and stumbled, the humans attacked him with great force. He did not miss the gaps between the humans and radiated pitch-black darkness.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;What? This is a pattern that didn’t exist before!&quot;」</div>「"What? This is a pattern that didn’t exist before!"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Novels didn’t originally show detailed patterns! Damn it, run away!&quot;」</div>「"Novels didn’t originally show detailed patterns! Damn it, run away!"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">One of the duo was missed, but the other was caught in the tentacles and could not escape.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Save me! Please save me!&quot;」</div>「"Save me! Please save me!"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">An obvious appeal that he had always heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The demon, not interested in human tears, lightly pierced the human&#x27;s heart with its tentacle. The man who was crying and bleeding out died.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「It’s boring.」</div>「It’s boring.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment that thought occurred to him, he was surprised at himself.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「What is &#x27;boredom&#x27;?」</div>「What is 'boredom'?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s a feeling he&#x27;s never had before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He suddenly lowered his head and looked down at the tip of his tentacle. There was a small doll statue that gave off a faint light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An item he had never seen before while living as a demon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if he was possessed, he moved his tentacles and grabbed the doll, and countless emotions that he had never felt before came flooding back to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A very precious, sad, and nostalgic feeling. What followed was a very strong appetite.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He could not overcome his desire and eventually swallowed the doll.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What is &#x27;I&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s how the demon recognized his existence for the first time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I am the &#x27;keeper of darkness&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">No.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That is not an accurate expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I am an &#x27;extra&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though he didn&#x27;t really understand what &#x27;extra&#x27; was, he felt the nuance of the word.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He wanted to know. What is this feeling?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have evolved into a 5th grade demon species, &#x27;Dark Seeker&#x27;.]</div>[You have evolved into a 5th grade demon species, 'Dark Seeker'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">He participated in the scenario and started hunting. He learned to fight from the humans who came to hunt him. He no longer fought like a &#x27;Dark Sentinel&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He used weapons and wore equipment possessed by humans.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Oh my god! It’s a 5th grade demon!&quot;」</div>「"Oh my god! It’s a 5th grade demon!"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;There is no proper information about the Dark Seeker—&quot;」</div>「"There is no proper information about the Dark Seeker—"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Run! Everyone run!&quot;」</div>「"Run! Everyone run!"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just like that, one, two, three... killing people again and again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And very occasionally, he could get something from particularly strong humans.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Kim Dokja’s Fragment&#x27; has been acquired.]</div>['Kim Dokja’s Fragment' has been acquired.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">He didn&#x27;t understand the meaning of the message, but he understood at least one thing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The more of these &#x27;fragments&#x27; he acquires, the stronger he becomes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He began hunting humans at an increasingly faster rate. He became familiar with the habits of humans and learned their mannerisms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He set traps targeting humans looking for hidden items, and even deliberately disguised himself as a weak monster species.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How many fragments could he have eaten that way?</p>
<p class="orv_line">When he came to his senses, he had already become a demon noble.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have evolved into a &#x27;Demon Noble&#x27;.]</div>[You have evolved into a 'Demon Noble'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">And that &#x27;being&#x27; came to visit him.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Wow, this is my first time seeing a devil like you.]</div>[Wow, this is my first time seeing a devil like you.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">A group called &#x27;Administrative Bureau&#x27; by the public.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Don’t you want to have a &#x27;name&#x27;?]</div>[Don’t you want to have a 'name'?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The dokkaebi from the management bureau asked and he nodded.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[If you give me all your Coins, I will give you a &#x27;name&#x27;.]</div>[If you give me all your Coins, I will give you a 'name'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">He willingly paid with the coins he had collected after killing the incarnations.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[From now on, you are the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27;.]</div>[From now on, you are the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s how he became the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When he actually heard it, he felt like it was a name that suited him very well. The stories boiling inside him were saying so.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Collect the fragments.」</div>「Collect the fragments.」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Become the one and only &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27;.」</div>「Become the one and only 'Kim Dokja'.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a feeling of elation welling up from deep within his soul.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He will become the &#x27;Demon King&#x27; of this world. He will break away from being an &#x27;extra&#x27; and become a ‘being’ who longs for the real ◾️◾️.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, as if laughing at his efforts,</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You’ve just ascended to the rank of marquis.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The real hero of this story came to visit him.</p>
