            <div class="orv_title"><h1>701 Episode 25 Demon King (4)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Christina pursed her lips and continued speaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I had to make decisions quickly," she said. "Too many people died before we even got to the fifth scenario."</p>
<p class="orv_line">How did she manage to get to the fifth scenario?</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the apostles who knew the ending of this story knew that if the scenarios continued like this, everything would go wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ultimate resolution of the scenarios were impossible in this world line where Kim Dokja does not exist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how well they clear the previous scenarios, they will end up frustrated in front of the 'Final Wall'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So they decided to take a risk in the fifth scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Summoning the 'Demon King of Salvation' with the 'Disaster Summoning Rights'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it was called crazy, it was a choice that I had nothing to say about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What were you going to do if you failed?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Besides, even if you succeed, it’s still a problem."</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the 'Demon King of Salvation' had been summoned as a disaster, something truly absurd could have happened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, I could not find fault with the readers’ heart for looking for Kim Dokja at the most desperate moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it's because I too had a similar experience like them.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"I will sign a contract behind the scenes."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Just like searching for God, anyone who knows Kim Dokja's name has no choice but to find him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is probably the same for all readers who came to this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked, looking down at Anna Croft, who was sleeping soundly on Christina's lap.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"She was [hypnotized], so Anna doesn’t know the details of the situation."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft is the most cautious character in 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is no way she would suddenly agree to summoning a being that she has never heard of or seen, the 'Demon King of Salvation', as a disaster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, Christina and the apostles hypnotized Anna and they secretly summoned the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In return, the 'Washington Dome' became a demon realm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"At first, we were planning to do whatever we could to stop it. We gathered all the apostles in America and headed to the Washington Dome. That happened a few weeks ago."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It would not have been possible to honestly say that Washington was destroyed because of their choices.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To make up for their mistakes, the apostles attempted to attack the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You failed."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is that why you brought me here?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m ashamed."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Christina must have thought the moment she confirmed my sponsor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Demon King of Salvation' they were looking for was already in this world line, and maybe that's why their 'summoning' failed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is there really a 'Demon King of Salvation' in this world? Is there a 'Kim Dokja' we know?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is there a 'Kim Dokja' they know in this world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a moment and answered like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There is a friend who is much more real than the 'Demon King of Salvation' over there. What on earth is the 'Demon King of Salvation' over there?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don’t know. What’s certain is that he wasn’t the 'Demon King of Salvation' that we know. And…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"And?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The Demon King continued to grow stronger every time the apostles visited."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did he continue to get stronger every time the apostles visited him?</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a theory that came to mind, but I wasn't sure yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I have one person who can confirm all these hypotheses.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Kim-ssi.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">This guy said he was going to exchange coins, but where on earth did he go?</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, with a chirping sound, 'Midday Tryst' was reconnected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'No, where did you go and why are you coming back only now?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Youngest, I’m in big trouble.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'A big problem happened here too.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was trying to explain what incredible things have happened while he was away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However,</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I think my modifier was stolen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed like something really big had happened over there too.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Everything in the <Star Stream> is a 'story', that is, a 'tale'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, since the concept of 'tale' seemed so abstract, 'currency', a practical processing of it, appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is the story of the 'coin' we know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Constellations spend coins just by breathing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Do constellations need to breathe?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It means that coins are consumed just by existing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I know, but I didn't know that it costs money to maintain a modifier.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since Kim Dokja never mentioned it once, I never thought about it either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I never thought it would cost coins just by using a modifier. Is that why the constellations have always been keen on earning coins?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'But are you saying that your constellation modifier has been taken away?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Not a constellation modifier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Are you sure?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I also have a Demon King modifier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to Kim Dokja's claim, constellations that suddenly came from other 'world lines' like Kim Dokja had to pay additional fees to use the <Star Stream> system.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Kim Dokja was both a 'constellation' and a Demon King, so the cost of maintaining the modifier was doubled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'How did you maintain the constellation modifier, but you couldn’t pay the cost of maintaining the Demon King modifier?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered why this person was so obsessed with 'coins'…</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I was thinking of exchanging some of the story fragments and monster parts I got this time and buying the modifier again... but the management bureau had already sold off my Demon King modifier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly I felt like I knew how things were going.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I briefly explained to Kim Dokja about the events that occurred in the United States.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When he heard the story about the apostles of the American continent and the 'right to summon disaster', Kim Dokja let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Oh, that was the spam message from the administration. They said it was a disaster blah blah blah.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It looks like he didn't even read the management bureau's message.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Then the Demon King of Salvation who is currently in Washington...'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It’s probably the new 'Demon King of Salvation' that the Management Bureau has found.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'This is the guy who bought the Demon King's nickname.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, the 'Demon King of Salvation' currently in Washington is a counterfeit, 'Demon King of Salvation' in name only.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Is he also a 'Demon King'?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It won’t be at the level of a Demon King. Because they have a lot of pride, they don't steal and use other people's modifiers. He's probably a demon trying to use this opportunity to ascend to the throne of the Demon King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter what the guy's identity was, for now I had no choice but to head to Washington.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had Christina wake Anna up and explain what was needed. Anna Croft looked very embarrassed, but she quickly calmly accepted the situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m angry, but I can’t help it. I’ll take strict action for this later, Christina."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m sorry, Anna."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Please swear an [Oath of Existence]. You will never [Hypnotize] me again."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I swear."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna did not press Christina any further. Maybe it's because she knows that persecuting her now won't solve her situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna had her artisans bring the completed '4th grade Earth Dragon' equipment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You’ve caused trouble. Cheon Inho, let’s leave right away."</p>
<p class="orv_line">After completing preparations, we immediately opened the portal to the 'Washington Dome'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the situation got to this point, I too became confused.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Are my companions still safe?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What happened to Yoo Jonghyuk, who met a marquis-level demon species?</p>
<p class="orv_line">How strong is the 'Demon King of Salvation' in the Washington Dome?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I sort out my complicated thoughts and stepped into the portal.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Someone has killed the ruler of 'Washington East'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A message was heard.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The 'demon' had no name.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are a 7th grade demon species 'Dark Sentinel'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He, like most other demon species, existed only as a part of a scenario designed by dokkaebis. Killing the incarnations that come to the 'Treasure Storehouse of the Earth River Lord' and offering their souls to the demon kings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The demon had no complaints about it. Just as gopher rats never question their breathing, breathing black ether, and collecting treasures, he also never once questioned his work.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The whole incident started with him killing some humans who were hiding in his 'treasure warehouse'.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"It is the Keeper of Darkness!"」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"It’s true. It’s just like the novel."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He dealt with the incarnations as usual. Attack using tentacles.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But surprisingly, the duo skillfully repelled his attack.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Through! Kim Dokja's method works! Push on!"」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"If you attack the left ankle, the upper right tentacle moves!"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Not only did humans know his attack patterns, but they also used weapons with 'divine attributes' to which he was vulnerable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He screamed every time his tentacles were cut.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"It’s over! Finish it!"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Looking back, if he had been an ordinary 'dark sentinel', he certainly would not have been able to withstand the attacks of that duo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the duo was unlucky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The period of time he lived as a 'Dark Sentinel' was a little longer than other 'Dark Sentinels', and because of that, he was able to display a little more wisdom in battle than other entities.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When he pretended to be weak and stumbled, the humans attacked him with great force. He did not miss the gaps between the humans and radiated pitch-black darkness.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"What? This is a pattern that didn’t exist before!"」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Novels didn’t originally show detailed patterns! Damn it, run away!"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">One of the duo was missed, but the other was caught in the tentacles and could not escape.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Save me! Please save me!"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">An obvious appeal that he had always heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The demon, not interested in human tears, lightly pierced the human's heart with its tentacle. The man who was crying and bleeding out died.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「It’s boring.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment that thought occurred to him, he was surprised at himself.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「What is 'boredom'?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It's a feeling he's never had before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He suddenly lowered his head and looked down at the tip of his tentacle. There was a small doll statue that gave off a faint light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An item he had never seen before while living as a demon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if he was possessed, he moved his tentacles and grabbed the doll, and countless emotions that he had never felt before came flooding back to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A very precious, sad, and nostalgic feeling. What followed was a very strong appetite.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He could not overcome his desire and eventually swallowed the doll.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What is 'I'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's how the demon recognized his existence for the first time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am the 'keeper of darkness'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">No.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That is not an accurate expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am an 'extra'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though he didn't really understand what 'extra' was, he felt the nuance of the word.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He wanted to know. What is this feeling?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have evolved into a 5th grade demon species, 'Dark Seeker'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He participated in the scenario and started hunting. He learned to fight from the humans who came to hunt him. He no longer fought like a 'Dark Sentinel'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He used weapons and wore equipment possessed by humans.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Oh my god! It’s a 5th grade demon!"」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"There is no proper information about the Dark Seeker—"」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Run! Everyone run!"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Just like that, one, two, three... killing people again and again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And very occasionally, he could get something from particularly strong humans.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Kim Dokja’s Fragment' has been acquired.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He didn't understand the meaning of the message, but he understood at least one thing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The more of these 'fragments' he acquires, the stronger he becomes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He began hunting humans at an increasingly faster rate. He became familiar with the habits of humans and learned their mannerisms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He set traps targeting humans looking for hidden items, and even deliberately disguised himself as a weak monster species.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How many fragments could he have eaten that way?</p>
<p class="orv_line">When he came to his senses, he had already become a demon noble.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have evolved into a 'Demon Noble'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And that 'being' came to visit him.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Wow, this is my first time seeing a devil like you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A group called 'Administrative Bureau' by the public.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Don’t you want to have a 'name'?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The dokkaebi from the management bureau asked and he nodded.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[If you give me all your Coins, I will give you a 'name'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He willingly paid with the coins he had collected after killing the incarnations.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[From now on, you are the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That's how he became the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When he actually heard it, he felt like it was a name that suited him very well. The stories boiling inside him were saying so.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Collect the fragments.」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Become the one and only 'Kim Dokja'.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was a feeling of elation welling up from deep within his soul.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He will become the 'Demon King' of this world. He will break away from being an 'extra' and become a ‘being’ who longs for the real ◾️◾️.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, as if laughing at his efforts,</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You’ve just ascended to the rank of marquis."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The real hero of this story came to visit him.</p>
