<p class="orv_line">By the way, I think this is the first time I&#x27;ve gotten an update message.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was tempted to open my phone, but I couldn&#x27;t afford to right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a bloody battle between humans and monsters going on a dozen meters away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No. What is that—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo&#x27;s eyes widened at the sight of Jung Heewon&#x27;s battle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Come to think of it, wasn&#x27;t Cheon Inho originally killed by Jung Heewon? That&#x27;s when she</p>
<p class="orv_line">became the &#x27;Judge of Destruction&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then how did Jung Heewon awaken now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s a long story, so let&#x27;s just watch for now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Covered in crimson blood, Jung Heewon had already cut off more than a third of the centipede&#x27;s</p>
<p class="orv_line">legs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Demon Slaying Judge.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Judge&#x27;s trait of causing an explosive increase in combat power against monsters resonated</p>
<p class="orv_line">with Jung Heewon&#x27;s Kendo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sugagagagak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With each swing of Jung Heewon&#x27;s sword, half-dozen centipede legs were sliced off at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A precise and swift swordplay, dodging out of the centipede&#x27;s line of sight, cutting only its feet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein waved his shield and shouted.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Uaaah! Heewon&#x27;s the best!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye, who had been lying idle in the stairwell, was also watching the battle with fascination.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow, she&#x27;s killing it.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The majesty of single-handedly defeating a 7th grade monster species, a King at that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a battle that only Yoo Joonghyuk was capable of, and now Jung Heewon was showing it</p>
<p class="orv_line">in front of our eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was so focused on the battle that her inner voice echoed vividly in my ears.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I will never lose.」</div>「I will never lose.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">What was in front of her now was a monster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But in a sense, it wasn&#x27;t the monster she was fighting.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Next time, surely.」</div>「Next time, surely.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was alone, fighting an imaginary enemy, a man who was better with a sword than anyone</p>
<p class="orv_line">she knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Imagining his sword, she swung, and swung, and swung again.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I have to be faster.」</div>「I have to be faster.」</p>

<p class="orv_line">tell what happened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A man who had been catching the ground rats a few moments earlier was being torn apart by</p>

<p class="orv_line">The fort collapsed with a single explosion.</p>

<p class="orv_line">&quot;Help me! Help me!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu&#x27;s shattered turrets could be seen in the dust, his proud [Private Property] and [Armed</p>

<p class="orv_line">With a snap, it was sliced in half.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye was in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Master told me to keep you alive.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">She spat out the gum she&#x27;d been chewing, and didn&#x27;t even look back at me as if she was bothered.</p>

<p class="orv_line">&quot;I can&#x27;t catch that kind of thing either. I&#x27;ll just buy time, so pull yourself together and go upstairs</p>
<p class="orv_line">now.&quot;</p>

<p class="orv_line">The writer of this story knows it, and the reader knows it.</p>

<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Please take care of Heewon-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye, who received Jung Heewon without hesitation, looked at me in surprise.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I ignored her and started walking forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stuck a thorn into the head of an approaching ground rat and kept walking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What the hell! Ahjussi! Do you really want to die?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Die?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I won&#x27;t die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this really was a life-threatening situation, time would have stopped and the world would have</p>
