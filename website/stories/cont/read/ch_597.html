            <div class="orv_title"><h1>597 Episode 9. Words That Can't Be Said (3)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">The timing was perfect.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Enter the platform now to check the new chapter of 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, I think this is the first time I've gotten an update message.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was tempted to open my phone, but I couldn't afford to right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a bloody battle between humans and monsters going on a dozen meters away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No. What is that—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo's eyes widened at the sight of Jung Heewon's battle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Come to think of it, wasn't Cheon Inho originally killed by Jung Heewon? That's when she became the 'Judge of Destruction'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then how did Jung Heewon awaken now?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's a long story, so let's just watch for now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Covered in crimson blood, Jung Heewon had already cut off more than a third of the centipede's legs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Demon Slaying Judge.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Judge's trait of causing an explosive increase in combat power against monsters resonated with Jung Heewon's Kendo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sugagagagak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With each swing of Jung Heewon's sword, half-dozen centipede legs were sliced off at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A precise and swift swordplay, dodging out of the centipede's line of sight, cutting only its feet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein waved his shield and shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uaaah! Heewon's the best!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye, who had been lying idle in the stairwell, was also watching the battle with fascination.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wow, she's killing it......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The majesty of single-handedly defeating a 7th grade monster species, a King at that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a battle that only Yoo Joonghyuk was capable of, and now Jung Heewon was showing it in front of our eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was so focused on the battle that her inner voice echoed vividly in my ears.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I will never lose. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What was in front of her now was a monster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But in a sense, it wasn't the monster she was fighting.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Next time, surely. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">She was alone, fighting an imaginary enemy, a man who was better with a sword than anyone she knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Imagining his sword, she swung, and swung, and swung again.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I have to be faster. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk's sword was the essence (精髓) of martial arts, forged by the time and effort of countless masters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She couldn't follow its trajectory now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, she could see where it was headed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A sword forged to shatter the heavens of this world and make the stars fall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship (破天劍道).</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Jung Heewon's skill proficiency is rising rapidly!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Her sword was blossoming from the bitter defeat. A bluish aura was now permeating her ground rat knife.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dedicated Sword Force (罡氣功).</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was unmistakable. Though it was still faint, it was the Dedicated Sword Force used by the masters of Murim.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is surprised by the talent of the incarnation 'Jung Heewon'.]</p></div>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Goryeo's First Sword' is looking at the incarnation 'Jung Heewon' with interest.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A technique that she learned on her own, without being taught by anyone, without even learning a superlative skill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, Jung Heewon was also extraordinarily talented in the original.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Could she reach the level of Yoo Joonghyuk in this turn?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your 'Free Comments Daily Pass' will disappear soon!]</p></div>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[Free Comments Daily Passes accumulate up to a maximum of 2, and will expire if not used within today.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My head spun. I looked at my watch and it was almost midnight. The pass cost a whopping 3,000 coins.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just in time, Ye Hyunwoo signaled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Everyone in the front, except for Jung Heewon, please step back for a moment! Let's work on the line with concentrated fire from now on!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">With Jung Heewon and the giant centipede fighting it out, all the ground rats and grolls' formation in the area collapsed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo didn't miss the opportunity and ordered the fire.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dududududu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a brief pause in the back-and-forth battle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It would be fine to check the comments for a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I joined the crowd and slipped into the rear, then quickly opened my phone and turned on the platform app.</p>

<p class="orv_line">That's a lot of chapters in a short time. At first glance, there are over 40 chapters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What did I do to get this far already? I haven't even finished 'Emergency Defense Battle' yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, I still haven't figured out who wrote this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The people on the back, please check your equipment! We'll be back in action in five minutes!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was running out of time, so I decided to check out the recent comments.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe they'd have some useful information.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Luckily, I still had five free passes left.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[1 free daily pass will be deducted.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>—Uh</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">I think it should be illegal in Korea to leave a one syllable comment.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[1 free daily pass will be deducted.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">

<p class="orv_line">If the next comment I see is 'Hyuk', I might actually want to die.</p>

<p class="orv_line">1,000 coins.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's a bit expensive, but.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">At least if a comment is highly recommended, it's more likely to contain nutritious information, right?</p>

</div>
<p class="orv_line">Sunfish is the nickname of Yoo Joonghyuk, who often dies and regresses.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My head was spinning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did it mean that Yoo Joonghyuk was going to die?</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it couldn't be.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Yoo Joonghyuk I saw in the 41st turn was more like a 'scumbag' than a 'sunfish'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, I could see Jung Heewon, who had cut off all the legs of the giant centipede, delivering the final blow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Get ready to go in one minute!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The five minutes were already coming to an end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hesitated for a moment and used up the last pass.</p>

<p class="orv_line">I looked around with anxiety for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu was firing shells steadily, and the line of ground rats had been completely pushed outward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After finishing off the giant centipede, I could see Jung Heewon running towards me, stomping on a ground rat's head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was nothing weird.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Time hadn't stopped, and the world hadn't turned colorless, so—!</p>
<p class="orv_line">———!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The floor of the platform exploded in front of me, sending me flying through the air as debris scrawled and scattered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With my ears ringing, I spit out dust and stood up. My vision hadn't recovered yet, so I couldn't tell what happened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A man who had been catching the ground rats a few moments earlier was being torn apart by them, his body separated from the waist down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Horrified people crawled on their asses.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fort collapsed with a single explosion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ground rats had broken through the turret line and were tearing the incarnations apart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Help me! Help me!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu's shattered turrets could be seen in the dust, his proud [Private Property] and [Armed Zone] both destroyed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo was shaking the bleeding Gong Pildu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi! Ahjussi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">What the hell happened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surely everything was going well. There wasn't even a warning from '■■'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What the hell.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kkukukukuku.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A monster species emerged from the settled dust.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Emergency Defense Battle' has entered a new phase.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[An additional 7th grade monster species has appeared!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Giant Centipede.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was even bigger than the one Jung Heewon had caught. Jung Heewon stretched out her hand and called out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was another explosion from the ground.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[An additional 7th grade monster species has appeared!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The tail of the beast protruding from the ground collided directly with Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I barely caught the body of Jung Heewon that was sent flying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon let out a painful breath. It seemed that she had received a heavy blow to her back when [Hour of Judgement] was released.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A middle-aged man crawling on the ground next to me shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"E-everyone, run!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The middle-aged man stepped on my phone, which had fallen to the ground. Above the cracked screen, the platform screen I was looking at floated.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>Episode 9. Words That Can't Be Said (3)+[34]</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">The comments grew in real time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All I could see was the comments of my readers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know how the chapters are actually written.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "You've all thought about it at least once: In that world, what kind of life will those who are not chosen by Kim Dokja live?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the 5,000 characters of text, I wonder if our story is being written properly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How many people died in this 'Emergency Defense Battle' that Kim Dokja couldn't see until the end. How many suffered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What stories were told.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will the reader of this chapter know that now?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I believe you know the truth about what it's like to be an 'extra' in this world." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Probably not.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because their deaths are not stories people want to read.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' yawns and says he's getting a little bored.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' wants a novel scenario solution.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Because a generic extra's death doesn't attract any of the stars' attention.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is watching your choice.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As I stood up with Jung Heewon in my arms, a ground rat pounced through the dust.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you doing? Are you out of your mind?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a snap, it was sliced in half.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye was in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Master told me to keep you alive."</p>
<p class="orv_line">She spat out the gum she'd been chewing, and didn't even look back at me as if she was bothered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The giant centipede that had spotted us was coming this way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I can't catch that kind of thing either. I'll just buy time, so pull yourself together and go upstairs now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye is strong. This kind of adversity won't kill her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The writer of this story knows it, and the reader knows it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps Lee Jihye herself knows this.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 But what about Cheon Inho? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I slowed my pace and stood beside Lee Jihye.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye's eyes widened as she killed the approaching ground rats.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Please take care of Heewon-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye, who received Jung Heewon without hesitation, looked at me in surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I ignored her and started walking forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stuck a thorn into the head of an approaching ground rat and kept walking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What the hell! Ahjussi! Do you really want to die?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Die?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I won't die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this really was a life-threatening situation, time would have stopped and the world would have turned colorless.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And I would have a manuscript opening with all sorts of negative scene titles, like 'The Death of the Villain', 'The Villain's Crisis', 'The Villain's End', and so on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So this silence was a clear opening line for me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Cheon Inho won't die here. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah, stop! You're really going to die!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The platform was littered with the bodies of dead ground rats and humans.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I blinked slowly, as if taking a photograph.</p>
