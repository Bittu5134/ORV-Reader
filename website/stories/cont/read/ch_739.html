<p class="orv_line">—『Understanding the Unemployed』</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After the scenario began, most people stayed up all night with their eyes wide open.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A situation where you never know when and where a monster or enemy will appear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fatigue can be alleviated by consuming 'Elaine Forest Spirit' or restorative medicine, so there was no need to take risks unless there was a sleep penalty.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A world where sleep has become a luxury.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that sense, all incarnations living out the scenario had lost their dreams.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The same was true for the incarnations in front of me right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The prisoner, who had been trapped in the prison of a scenario for a long time and had forgotten to dream, asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A-are you really going to change the story?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The crane owner looked at me with a nervous expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I can change it for you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If the &lt;Zodiac&gt; finds out..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The &lt;Zodiac&gt; can’t come."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pointed to the entrance of the inn with my chin. Lycaon was sitting there, cross-legged, with his eyes closed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Several beastmen looked at each other and nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They also confirmed Lycaon's power. There was no fear of not believing what I said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What story can I change?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That is…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Is it 'The Fox and the Crane'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How did you know?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">How do I know? There is nothing to do.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'The Fox and the Crane' has been discontinued.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This is because after repairing the story fragment 「Brick House」, I could gradually see the flow of stories floating around this 'Zone 13'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The crane owner sighed lightly and opened his mouth again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Recently, the status of my story has become unstable."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order for a 'story' to maintain its original function, the actual owner of the story must be continuously active in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;, or the story must be continuously talked about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"So, I tried to tell the story through a 'staging', but I couldn’t stage it on my own."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I guess so. That's because the story isn't just about the crane.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are there no foxes in Zone 13?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The crane owner nodded his head with a sigh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There used to be one, but the last fox disappeared a few months ago."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What happened to the last fox?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We stopped hearing from him after he was captured by the Zodiac."</p>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Zodiac&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was obvious why they did what they did.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The presence of the story 'The Fox and the Crane' opens up.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This is probably because it would be difficult if someone who has built up a legend in Zone 13 threatens their position.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly looked around at the beastmen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps some of these were Constellations, like the 'wolf' in 「The Three Little Pigs」, or were beings that came close to being Constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's just that as time goes by, they lose their own story and their original status.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The owner muttered in a weak voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The fox is probably dead."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps that's what the 'story' said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because he and the fox are tied together by stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"At first, I thought about disposing of the stories in the &lt;Zodiac&gt;. If I hand over the stories there, even if the stories are deformed, their status will be maintained."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of the wolf Constellation struggling to maintain 「The Three Little Pigs」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But I couldn’t do that. I didn’t want to bow down to the guys who captured the fox, even if it meant losing the story."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The owner lowered his head as he said that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know that I have to let go of the story now. It’s a story I can’t protect alone, and it’s not particularly important to the &lt;Star Stream&gt;. But…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A strange desire was shining in the eyes of the crane owner who slowly raised his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I thought you might have a way."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There is a way."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Really?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A scenario message suddenly appeared before my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's probably a scenario initiated by the 'Recycling Center Director' or the management bureau who was watching the situation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new sub-scenario has arrived!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Sub Scenario – The Fox and the Crane&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Sub</p>
<p>Difficulty: C</p>
<p>Clear condition: Succeed in reproducing the story 『The Fox and the Crane』.</p>
<p>Time limit: —</p>
<p>Reward: 12,000 recycled coins or 2,000 recycled coins and an unidentified story fragment</p>
<p>Failure: —</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">The situation was different from the time of 「The Three Little Pigs」. Since the situation did not specifically involve the &lt;Zodiac&gt;, there was no hesitation in participating on stage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is finding a role to play the role of a 'fox'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King raised his hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will do it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Killer King-ssi is a wolf."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Just change it to wolves and cranes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If we want to make a staging, we need a fox."</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, no one in our group had a 'fox mask'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fox, fox.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It would be nice to have a story similar to 'Fox'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Oh, wait a minute.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Check the delayed 'compensation list'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Now that I think about it, there was a 'story reward' that I had not received yet.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Check the rewards for the seventh main scenario.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently, 'S-class skill selection' is waiting to be received.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently, 'historical-grade story selection' is waiting to be received.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it's 'S-level skill selection', 'historical-grade story selection'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I guess this wasn't the original scenario reward?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have achieved an impossible feat in the seventh main scenario.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Bureau recognizes your achievements.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The scenario reward 'random historical-grade story' has been upgraded to  ‘historical-grade story selection'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The management bureau did something helpful for the first time in a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well, considering what happened at the Washington Dome, upward payment is quite possible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, it is a historical-grade story selection.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Historical-grade stories are mostly trash, but there are some useful ones, such as 「The Persistent Murim Master」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are also things that display processing abilities when fused, such as 「earrings when worn on the ear」or 「nose rings when worn on the nose」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I checked the reward list with some anticipation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Check the list of historical-grade story rewards.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can choose one of a total of 461 stories.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">461.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Could it be that some of this is useful?</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>1. Poop pretending to be soybean paste</p>
<p>2. Cat with tanned whiskers</p>
<p>3. Silla-Tang Allied Forces</p>
<p>…</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">For some reason, all I could see were lame stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is also a story that would have happened if the Demon King of Salvation was next to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued to look at the stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Number 10, Number 30, Number 50, Number 100..</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>122. I’m not getting my hair cut.</p>
<p>123. Head Shoulders Knees Toes</p>
<p>124. A chef who can’t distinguish between salt and sugar</p>
<p>125. Ornamental Beard Specialist</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Occasionally, stories that seemed to come from the 'Random Story Box' were also seen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the ranks passed the 200th, and even the 300th mark, an ominous feeling slowly came over me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how I looked at it, it seemed like they had just picked up and collected stories discarded by other Constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were even stories like 「Earrings on your ears」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment when I finally felt resigned to whether or not I should give up.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>461. Owner of the Fox Ears headband</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked closely at the last story that came out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why on earth is this story here?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Owner of the Fox Ears Headband’'</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to my thoughts, this 'story' was definitely that 'story'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Probably when &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; visited the amusement park in &lt;Oz&gt;.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "What are you doing here?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned around, Yoo Joonghyuk was there, wearing a fox headband as expected.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">… Even if it’s not that story, it doesn’t matter. Anyway, since 'fox' was included, it was a story that could be used immediately.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I will choose number 461.'</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The historical-grade story, 'Owner of the Fox Ears Headband' has been acquired.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately started talking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, if you use this 'story', a fox that wasn't there won't suddenly appear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, what is included in this story is not a fox, but 'fox ears'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Owner of the Fox Ear Headband' begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at my mask reflected in the window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is said that in this world, the 'mask' is a story that protects oneself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But if this 'mask' is really a story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Stick.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">It would also be possible to tie together stories and stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Stick.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">How many times has the story been told like that?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Owner of the Fox Ears Headband' responds to your will.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My mask began to emit a faint light. The prisoners watching us nearby let out exclamations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, oh—!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The shape of my previously invisible mask changed in real time. The mask's snout grew pointed, and small ears also sprouted from its head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It literally looks like a 'fox mask'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'The Fox and the Crane' is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The owner of the crane also held my hand with an expression of emotion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"So, you… were you the fox?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fox in this story is dead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I were to act as the fox's replacement and successfully stage the story, the story would only be talked about for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I can help you, but even if you recreate the 「stage」 like this, the effect will only be temporary."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know that."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As in 「The Three Little Pigs」, there may be ways to change the plot of the story and introduce new stories or make other animals appear, but these are also temporary measures.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don’t you want to become famous again?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Originally, 'The Fox and the Crane' is a story as famous as 'The Three Little Pigs'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The owner looked confused.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don’t you want to share your story with the &lt;Star Stream&gt; once again?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Creating a story that everyone knows about in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;. It is the dream of every Constellation shining in the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"As you know, the reason Zone 13's stories are weakening is because you're trapped in the Recycling Center."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know, but we can’t leave the center."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You are like that. But what about 'stories'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The crane owner looked at me with an expression of disbelief.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded and added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We are spreading the story inside the Recycling Center throughout the &lt;Star Stream&gt;."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That’s impossible. The Constellations outside the center cannot know what happened inside the center. The stories that occur here cannot possibly become famous."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"In principle, yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">And from here was the second stage of my operation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Bihyung'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you can't see it, just make it visible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Please open the channel.'</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—You crazy person!</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, Bihyung appeared quickly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You crazy person! You crazy guy!</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Stop and listen to me.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Shut up, you crazy!</p>
<p class="orv_line">'…'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Outside now, do you know  what's going on? Are you out of your mind?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'What happened?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Are you asking because you really don’t know? Have you forgotten what you and your sponsor did right before entering the 'Recycling Center'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered what happened at the Washington Dome.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The Constellations are now gathering outside the Recycling Center, you know?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'What Constellations?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Who could it be?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I can roughly guess.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Asgard&gt;, &lt;Olympus&gt;, &lt;Ghost&gt;, &lt;Vedas&gt;, &lt;Tree of Protection&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There must have been a lot of Constellations from the Nebulae that were targeting us from the Washington Dome.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There will also be other Constellations of the Nebulae that flock to us after hearing the rumor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I think about it, it's a little scary.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Do you feel it now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Considering the scale of what I and the 'Demon King of Salvation' had done, it was not strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Demon King of Salvation' killed dozens of Great-grade Constellations belonging to each giant Nebula in 'Gingagap' of the mythical stage &lt;Asgard&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Where is that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">He even defeated 'Ares', who was Narrative-grade and was listed as one of the 12 gods of &lt;Olympus&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Naturally, the Constellations of &lt;Asgard&gt; and &lt;Olympus&gt; would have been greatly strengthened. Other Nebulae may also be starting to become curious about us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some Nebulae must have confirmed that the contract between me and the 'Demon King of Salvation' has not been terminated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I'm sure you'll be trapped in the underground torture chamber of 'Tartaros', where you'll be treated horribly, your ego will be removed, and you'll be used as a doll weapon!</p>
<p class="orv_line">'That's very specific.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—So you must never get caught. You’re definitely hidden inside the 'Recycling Center'. Never go outside. Outside Constellations cannot enter here, so you'll be safe...</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Thank you for your concern.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Why would I be worried about you? I'm just afraid that the value of my product will be damaged! Do you remember that our contract was extended? Your sponsor…</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I know.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Who knows that? Let's open the channel?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I'm not asking to open a live channel. We want to open a channel through which only stories can be distributed.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—No, what are you talking about…</p>
<p class="orv_line">'If the product has value, you must sell it before its value falls.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—What?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I heard everyone is waiting for me?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I'm trapped inside the Recycling Center, there's something I can feel.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The power of the story 'The One Who Rewrites Fate' becomes stronger.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even now, the story of the Demon King of Salvation and me is becoming famous.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, at this exact moment, I, the incarnation of the 'Demon King of Salvation', ended up in the 'Recycling Center'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Bihyung said, this is a place where external Constellations cannot intervene or spy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Constellations' curiosity about me will continue to grow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Then I have to live up to their expectations.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">We cannot remain trapped in the 'Recycling Center' forever. The moment will surely come when I have to escape from here and face the Nebulae.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Until then, the vast gap between the Constellations and me must be bridged.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Bihyung, you like coins, right?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">And in this &lt;Star Stream&gt;, there is a very efficient means to fill that gap.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'The Fox and the Crane' has stopped its storytelling.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'The Magpie Who Returned the Favor' has stopped its storytelling.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'The Goose that Laid the Golden Egg' has stopped its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said, rewriting my mask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'From now on, I plan to appear in all stories of Zone 13. So you—'</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, trends come and go.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grinned as I looked at the endless 'recycled stories'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Sell the stories I will appear in to the Constellations who pay coins.'</p>
