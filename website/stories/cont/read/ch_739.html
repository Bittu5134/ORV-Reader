<p class="orv_line">—『Understanding the Unemployed』</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After the scenario began, most people stayed up all night with their eyes wide open.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A situation where you never know when and where a monster or enemy will appear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fatigue can be alleviated by consuming &#x27;Elaine Forest Spirit&#x27; or restorative medicine, so there was no need to take risks unless there was a sleep penalty.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A world where sleep has become a luxury.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that sense, all incarnations living out the scenario had lost their dreams.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The same was true for the incarnations in front of me right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The prisoner, who had been trapped in the prison of a scenario for a long time and had forgotten to dream, asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;A-are you really going to change the story?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The crane owner looked at me with a nervous expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I can change it for you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If the &lt;Zodiac&gt; finds out...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The &lt;Zodiac&gt; can’t come.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pointed to the entrance of the inn with my chin. Lycaon was sitting there, cross-legged, with his eyes closed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Several beastmen looked at each other and nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They also confirmed Lycaon&#x27;s power. There was no fear of not believing what I said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What story can I change?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That is…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Is it &#x27;The Fox and the Crane&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How did you know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">How do I know? There is nothing to do.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;The Fox and the Crane&#x27; has been discontinued.]</div>[The story 'The Fox and the Crane' has been discontinued.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because after repairing the story fragment 「Brick House」, I could gradually see the flow of stories floating around this &#x27;Zone 13&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The crane owner sighed lightly and opened his mouth again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Recently, the status of my story has become unstable.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order for a &#x27;story&#x27; to maintain its original function, the actual owner of the story must be continuously active in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;, or the story must be continuously talked about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So, I tried to tell the story through a &#x27;staging&#x27;, but I couldn’t stage it on my own.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I guess so. That&#x27;s because the story isn&#x27;t just about the crane.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are there no foxes in Zone 13?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The crane owner nodded his head with a sigh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There used to be one, but the last fox disappeared a few months ago.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What happened to the last fox?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We stopped hearing from him after he was captured by the Zodiac.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Zodiac&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was obvious why they did what they did.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The presence of the story &#x27;The Fox and the Crane&#x27; opens up.]</div>[The presence of the story 'The Fox and the Crane' opens up.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is probably because it would be difficult if someone who has built up a legend in Zone 13 threatens their position.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly looked around at the beastmen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps some of these were constellations, like the &#x27;wolf&#x27; in 「The Three Little Pigs」, or were beings that came close to being constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s just that as time goes by, they lose their own story and their original status.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The owner muttered in a weak voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The fox is probably dead.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps that&#x27;s what the &#x27;story&#x27; said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because he and the fox are tied together by stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;At first, I thought about disposing of the stories in the &lt;Zodiac&gt;. If I hand over the stories there, even if the stories are deformed, their status will be maintained.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of the wolf constellation struggling to maintain 「The Three Little Pigs」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But I couldn’t do that. I didn’t want to bow down to the guys who captured the fox, even if it meant losing the story.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The owner lowered his head as he said that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know that I have to let go of the story now. It’s a story I can’t protect alone, and it’s not particularly important to the &lt;Star Stream&gt;. But…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A strange desire was shining in the eyes of the crane owner who slowly raised his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I thought you might have a way.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There is a way.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Really?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A scenario message suddenly appeared before my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s probably a scenario initiated by the &#x27;Recycling Center Director&#x27; or the management bureau who was watching the situation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new sub-scenario has arrived!]</div>[A new sub-scenario has arrived!]</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Sub Scenario – The Fox and the Crane&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Sub</p>
<p>Difficulty: C</p>
<p>Clear condition: Succeed in reproducing the story 『The Fox and the Crane』.</p>

<p>Failure: —</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">The situation was different from the time of 「The Three Little Pigs」. Since the situation did not specifically involve the &lt;Zodiac&gt;, there was no hesitation in participating on stage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is finding a role to play the role of a &#x27;fox&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King raised his hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will do it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Killer King-ssi is a wolf.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Just change it to wolves and cranes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If we want to make a staging, we need a fox.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, no one in our group had a &#x27;fox mask&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fox, fox.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It would be nice to have a story similar to &#x27;Fox&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Oh, wait a minute.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Check the delayed &#x27;compensation list&#x27;.]</div>[Check the delayed 'compensation list'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that I think about it, there was a &#x27;story reward&#x27; that I had not received yet.</p>

<p class="orv_line">The management bureau did something helpful for the first time in a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well, considering what happened at the Washington Dome, upward payment is quite possible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, it is a historical-grade story selection.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Historical-grade stories are mostly trash, but there are some useful ones, such as 「The Persistent Murim Master」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are also things that display processing abilities when fused, such as 「earrings when worn on the ear」or 「nose rings when worn on the nose」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I checked the reward list with some anticipation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Check the list of historical-grade story rewards.]</div>[Check the list of historical-grade story rewards.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can choose one of a total of 461 stories.]</div>[You can choose one of a total of 461 stories.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">461.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Could it be that some of this is useful?</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>1. Poop pretending to be soybean paste</p>
<p>2. Cat with tanned whiskers</p>
<p>3. Silla-Tang Allied Forces</p>
<p>…</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">For some reason, all I could see were lame stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is also a story that would have happened if the Demon King of Salvation was next to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued to look at the stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Number 10, Number 30, Number 50, Number 100..</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>122. I’m not getting my hair cut.</p>
<p>123. Head Shoulders Knees Toes</p>
<p>124. A chef who can’t distinguish between salt and sugar</p>
<p>125. Ornamental Beard Specialist</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Occasionally, stories that seemed to come from the &#x27;Random Story Box&#x27; were also seen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the ranks passed the 200th, and even the 300th mark, an ominous feeling slowly came over me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how I looked at it, it seemed like they had just picked up and collected stories discarded by other constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were even stories like 「Earrings on your ears」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment when I finally felt resigned to whether or not I should give up.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>461. Owner of the Fox Ears headband</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked closely at the last story that came out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why on earth is this story here?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Owner of the Fox Ears Headband’&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to my thoughts, this &#x27;story&#x27; was definitely that &#x27;story&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Probably when &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; visited the amusement park in &lt;Oz&gt;.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;」</div>「"What are you doing here?"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned around, Yoo Jonghyuk was there, wearing a fox headband as expected.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">… Even if it’s not that story, it doesn’t matter. Anyway, since &#x27;fox&#x27; was included, it was a story that could be used immediately.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;I will choose number 461.&#x27;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The historical-grade story, &#x27;Owner of the Fox Ears Headband&#x27; has been acquired.]</div>[The historical-grade story, 'Owner of the Fox Ears Headband' has been acquired.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately started talking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, if you use this &#x27;story&#x27;, a fox that wasn&#x27;t there won&#x27;t suddenly appear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, what is included in this story is not a fox, but &#x27;fox ears&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;Owner of the Fox Ear Headband&#x27; begins its storytelling.]</div>[The story 'Owner of the Fox Ear Headband' begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at my mask reflected in the window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is said that in this world, the &#x27;mask&#x27; is a story that protects oneself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But if this &#x27;mask&#x27; is really a story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Stick.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It would also be possible to tie together stories and stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Stick.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">How many times has the story been told like that?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;Owner of the Fox Ears Headband&#x27; responds to your will.]</div>[The story 'Owner of the Fox Ears Headband' responds to your will.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">My mask began to emit a faint light. The prisoners watching us nearby let out exclamations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, oh—!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The shape of my previously invisible mask changed in real time. The mask&#x27;s snout grew pointed, and small ears also sprouted from its head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It literally looks like a &#x27;fox mask&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;The Fox and the Crane&#x27; is looking at you.]</div>[The story 'The Fox and the Crane' is looking at you.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The owner of the crane also held my hand with an expression of emotion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So, you… were you the fox?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fox in this story is dead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I were to act as the fox&#x27;s replacement and successfully stage the story, the story would only be talked about for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I can help you, but even if you recreate the 「stage」 like this, the effect will only be temporary.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As in 「The Three Little Pigs」, there may be ways to change the plot of the story and introduce new stories or make other animals appear, but these are also temporary measures.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don’t you want to become famous again?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Originally, &#x27;The Fox and the Crane&#x27; is a story as famous as &#x27;The Three Little Pigs&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The owner looked confused.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don’t you want to share your story with the &lt;Star Stream&gt; once again?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Creating a story that everyone knows about in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;. It is the dream of every constellation shining in the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As you know, the reason Zone 13&#x27;s stories are weakening is because you&#x27;re trapped in the Recycling Center.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know, but we can’t leave the center.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You are like that. But what about &#x27;stories&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The crane owner looked at me with an expression of disbelief.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded and added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We are spreading the story inside the Recycling Center throughout the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That’s impossible. The constellations outside the center cannot know what happened inside the center. The stories that occur here cannot possibly become famous.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;In principle, yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">And from here was the second stage of my operation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Bihyung&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you can&#x27;t see it, just make it visible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Please open the channel.&#x27;</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—You crazy person!</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, Bihyung appeared quickly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You crazy person! You crazy guy!</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Stop and listen to me.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Shut up, you crazy!</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;…&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Outside now, do you know  what&#x27;s going on? Are you out of your mind?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;What happened?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Are you asking because you really don’t know? Have you forgotten what you and your sponsor did right before entering the &#x27;Recycling Center&#x27;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered what happened at the Washington Dome.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The constellations are now gathering outside the Recycling Center, you know?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;What constellations?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Who could it be?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I can roughly guess.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Asgard&gt;, &lt;Olympus&gt;, &lt;Ghost&gt;, &lt;Veda&gt;, &lt;Tree of Protection&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There must have been a lot of constellations from the nebulae that were targeting us from the Washington Dome.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There will also be other constellations of the nebulae that flock to us after hearing the rumor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I think about it, it&#x27;s a little scary.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Do you feel it now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Considering the scale of what I and the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; had done, it was not strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; killed dozens of great-grade constellations belonging to each giant nebula in &#x27;Gingagap&#x27; of the mythical stage &lt;Asgard&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Where is that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">He even defeated &#x27;Ares&#x27;, who was narrative-grade and was listed as one of the 12 gods of &lt;Olympus&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Naturally, the constellations of &lt;Asgard&gt; and &lt;Olympus&gt; would have been greatly strengthened. Other nebulae may also be starting to become curious about us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some nebulae must have confirmed that the contract between me and the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; has not been terminated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be trapped in the underground torture chamber of &#x27;Tartaros&#x27;, where you&#x27;ll be treated horribly, your ego will be removed, and you&#x27;ll be used as a doll weapon!</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;That&#x27;s very specific.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—So you must never get caught. You’re definitely hidden inside the &#x27;Recycling Center&#x27;. Never go outside. Outside constellations cannot enter here, so you&#x27;ll be safe...</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Thank you for your concern.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Why would I be worried about you? I&#x27;m just afraid that the value of my product will be damaged! Do you remember that our contract was extended? Your sponsor…</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;I know.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Who knows that? Let&#x27;s open the channel?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;I&#x27;m not asking to open a live channel. We want to open a channel through which only stories can be distributed.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—No, what are you talking about…</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;If the product has value, you must sell it before its value falls.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—What?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;I heard everyone is waiting for me?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I&#x27;m trapped inside the Recycling Center, there&#x27;s something I can feel.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The power of the story &#x27;The One Who Rewrites Fate&#x27; becomes stronger.]</div>[The power of the story 'The One Who Rewrites Fate' becomes stronger.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even now, the story of the Demon King of Salvation and me is becoming famous.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, at this exact moment, I, the incarnation of the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27;, ended up in the &#x27;Recycling Center&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Bihyung said, this is a place where external constellations cannot intervene or spy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations&#x27; curiosity about me will continue to grow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Then I have to live up to their expectations.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We cannot remain trapped in the &#x27;Recycling Center&#x27; forever. The moment will surely come when I have to escape from here and face the nebulae.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Until then, the vast gap between the constellations and me must be bridged.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Bihyung, you like coins, right?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">And in this &lt;Star Stream&gt;, there is a very efficient means to fill that gap.</p>

<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said, rewriting my mask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;From now on, I plan to appear in all stories of Zone 13. So you—&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, trends come and go.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grinned as I looked at the endless &#x27;recycled stories&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Sell the stories I will appear in to the constellations who pay coins.&#x27;</p>
