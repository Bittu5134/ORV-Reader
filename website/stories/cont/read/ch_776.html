<p class="orv_line">&quot;This, this, Private Lee Hyunsu—!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung, foaming at the mouth, had a seizure and collapsed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah&#x27;s eyes, watching from afar, widened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I poked Lee Hyunsung&#x27;s shoulder as he collapsed. Lee Hyunsung, who had completely lost consciousness, only repeated faint convulsions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I watched him drooling, I thought that this operation would not work. Even if breaking Goo Seonah&#x27;s hypnosis was the most urgent task, the characters also had human rights.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly passed Kim Namwoon, Lee Jihye, and Shin Yoosoung and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;From now on.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill &#x27;Incite Lv.10&#x27; is activated!]</div>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.10' is activated!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You all will wake up from hypnosis.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The characters that touched my fingertips convulsed like Lee Hyunsung. But they didn’t foam at the mouth or scream in trauma like that.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill &#x27;Incite Lv. 10&#x27; conflicts with &#x27;Daily Instigation Lv. 10&#x27;!]</div>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv. 10' conflicts with 'Daily Instigation Lv. 10'!]</p>

<p class="orv_line">A spark of probability flew from the air, and soon the characters collapsed on the spot like puppets with their strings cut.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah, who only then realized what I had done, approached me and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;[Incite], I guess you can use it like this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let’s stop now. I can subdue you in the same way.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Me? It won’t work on me? Because [Incite]—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah, who had closed the distance in an instant once again, reached out to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s only effective against opponents with a lower &#x27;rank&#x27; than you, right?&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The nail in the corner aimed for my neck. I quickly tilted my upper body back to dodge the attack and activated [Incite] at the same time.」</div>「The nail in the corner aimed for my neck.

<p class="orv_line">&quot;You are now—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The skill was nullified with a sound of &#x27;Tsutsut&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The activation of &#x27;Incite&#x27; was canceled.]</div>[The activation of 'Incite' was canceled.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah was laughing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I told you it wasn&#x27;t possible?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, it wasn&#x27;t impossible. If her rank wasn&#x27;t that far behind, it was theoretically possible to resist [Incite] using 「Insect Massacre」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But even if she had collected a lot of &#x27;Kim Dokja Fragments&#x27;, would she have a rank that wouldn&#x27;t be pushed back by me, the agent of the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I held &#x27;Unbreakable Faith&#x27; tightly with both hands and released my magical power.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Blade of Faith&#x27; is activated!]</div>['Blade of Faith' is activated!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was a quick and easy decision.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had consumed &#x27;Dae-Hwan-Dan&#x27; and had sufficient magical power. It would be best to subdue Goo Seonah as quickly as possible and go deal with the Demon Tribe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Goo Seonah was not about to be easily defeated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Dokja insisted on that weapon until the very end. I really didn&#x27;t like that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The pure white &#x27;Ravelinger&#x27; glowed in Goo Seonah&#x27;s hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why did he insist on that one when there were so many items?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#x27;Blade of Faith&#x27; and &#x27;Ravelinger&#x27; clashed, bathing the place in bright light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Ravelinger&#x27; is a weapon that exerts power beyond that of a holy relic in this world.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Character &#x27;Goo Seonah&#x27; activates the skill &#x27;Moonlight Sword Technique Lv. 10&#x27;!]</div>[Character 'Goo Seonah' activates the skill 'Moonlight Sword Technique Lv. 10'!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Moonlight Sword Technique.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sword technique that Bihyung first recommended, and one that Kim Dokja did not purchase.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah chose that sword technique and learned it. As if to prove that Kim Dokja was wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The path that Kim Dokja took is not the only right one.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Moonlight Sword Technique, whose proficiency was at its peak, stabbed my shoulder and thigh. I barely activated Baekcheongganggi to block the attack, and then I saw the iron club held in Goo Seonah&#x27;s left hand.]</div>[Moonlight Sword Technique, whose proficiency was at its peak, stabbed my shoulder and thigh. I barely activated Baekcheongganggi to block the attack, and then I saw the iron club held in Goo Seonah's left hand.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her main weapon that made her known as the &#x27;Iron Club Lady&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Character &#x27;Goo Seonah&#x27; activates the skill &#x27;Cheonryeongchu Lv.10&#x27;!]</div>[Character 'Goo Seonah' activates the skill 'Cheonryeongchu Lv.10'!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The iron club flying in from a certain direction narrowed my range of movement, and there was no room to dodge [Moonlight Sword Technique].</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if it had been waiting, the Ravelinger emitted light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A vein burst from my chest and pain consumed my mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Your physique is terrible. Your combat proficiency is also low. How on earth have you survived until now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah continued to push me as if mocking me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you by any chance a one-trick pony like Kim Dokja?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized something new.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We all read the same story of the world, but the way we understand it is different. There is no guarantee that someone who reads the same book repeatedly will necessarily &#x27;read&#x27; better.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps someone who reads it once can understand the story better than someone who reads it a hundred times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And this was Goo Seonah&#x27;s reading.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reading that only &#x27;Goo Seonah&#x27; experienced, and that I and other readers did not experience.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She survived in this world with that experience. Learning the Wolyeonggeom method with one hand and Cheonchu with the other.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the point where she was competing on equal footing with me, the agent of the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27;, her reading was already proven.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She barely achieved the same level as my story after fighting with &#x27;gods of the other world&#x27; and fighting a life-or-death battle. Of course, the way she formed her &#x27;level&#x27; was somewhat different from mine.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「She supplemented the insufficient quality of the story with the quantity of the stories, and strengthened the cohesion of the story with &#x27;Kim Dokja Fragments&#x27;.」</div>「She supplemented the insufficient quality of the story with the quantity of the stories, and strengthened the cohesion of the story with 'Kim Dokja Fragments'.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The small stories embedded in her entire body were talking to me as if they were screaming.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;The Exciting Nail&#x27; wants to imitate you!]</div>[The story 'The Exciting Nail' wants to imitate you!]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;Rice Cake, More Rice Cake than Meat&#x27; looks at you.]</div>[The story 'Rice Cake, More Rice Cake than Meat' looks at you.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">The Tiger Eating Rice Cakes. The Rat Eating Nails. The Dog Throwing Itself into a Flame. The Pig Living in a Brick House...</p>
<p class="orv_line">The stories of the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; constellations were inhabiting her body and forming a single constellation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;Master of the Twelve Zodiac Signs&#x27; shines brightly.]</div>[The story 'Master of the Twelve Zodiac Signs' shines brightly.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was the story she had.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story, 「Master of the Twelve Zodiac Signs」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A story that ties together the stories of the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; that were scattered everywhere.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The Wisdom of Animals to Fight Against the Tale of the Great with the Power of Great People.」</div>「The Wisdom of Animals to Fight Against the Tale of the Great with the Power of Great People.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thus, the leader of the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt;, who had never been born in the main story of &#x27;Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint&#x27;—was momentarily revealed before my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I won&#x27;t lose.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard those words, I felt a sense of realization. How long had she planned this stage?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will never do that to you. Even without items! Even without colleagues!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah, gritting her teeth and swinging her blade and iron club, was fierce. The history she lived left fatal scars all over my body.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Wow, this chapter was really fun!」</div>「Wow, this chapter was really fun!」</p>
<p class="orv_line">One, and then another, as each and every slash increased, I thought of the comments she left.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「But does he like Yoo Sangah or Han Sooyoung?」</div>「But does he like Yoo Sangah or Han Sooyoung?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was the reader who liked Kim Dokja more than anyone else—Kim Dokja&#x27;s choice.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Wow, I would never have done that if it were me. As expected of Kim Dokja!!」</div>「Wow, I would never have done that if it were me. As expected of Kim Dokja!!」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t know what made her so sad. That&#x27;s why I wanted to understand her anger.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was curious about her purpose and motivation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even at this moment, when I was enduring such intense attacks.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I was thinking that I even wanted to write this story.」</div>「I was thinking that I even wanted to write this story.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aaaaaaaah—!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah&#x27;s kick, seizing the opportunity, struck my abdomen. The moment my breath caught in my throat, the iron club aimed at my heart moved.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「How much effort did Goo Seonah have to put in to become this strong?」</div>「How much effort did Goo Seonah have to put in to become this strong?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">All of her actions turned into sentences in my head. I even thought that it wouldn&#x27;t be bad to die here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Strangely, what came to mind at that moment was the face of Yoo Jonghyuk in the 41st round.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;As long as you don&#x27;t give up on life, I will continue to use you.&quot;」</div>「"As long as you don't give up on life, I will continue to use you."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I still haven&#x27;t kept my promise from back then. I promised not to make this story a tragedy, so I can&#x27;t die yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I can&#x27;t die.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The &#x27;Blade of Faith&#x27; burns brightly!]</div>[The 'Blade of Faith' burns brightly!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I concentrated my saved magic power and struck the iron club with the blade. I put strength into my heel and took a stance, then felt the wind blowing.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Way of the Wind.]</div>[Way of the Wind.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah&#x27;s body staggered in the fierce wind that swept in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The stories of the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; howled loudly throughout Goo Seonah&#x27;s body.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The Rat&#x27;s Dexterity」</div>「The Rat's Dexterity」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The Tiger&#x27;s Strength」</div>「The Tiger's Strength」</p>

<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The Snake&#x27;s Recovery Power」</div>「The Snake's Recovery Power」</p>
<p class="orv_line">...</p>
<p class="orv_line">When the fragments of the stories of the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; simultaneously raised their voices, my head felt dizzy. However, I also had a &#x27;story fragment&#x27; for moments like this.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story fragment, &#x27;Understanding of the Unemployed&#x27; begins its storytelling.]</div>[Story fragment, 'Understanding of the Unemployed' begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Story fragments obtained in exchange for clearing Zone 13.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There, I helped animals that had lost their homes, had lost their way, or had lost their stories.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Understanding of the Unemployed.」</div>「Understanding of the Unemployed.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">And in return for that help, I barely managed to obtain a line of understanding.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story fragment &#x27;The Tiger&#x27;s Strength&#x27; senses your gaze.]</div>[Story fragment 'The Tiger's Strength' senses your gaze.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah&#x27;s muscular strength, which had been running towards me, rapidly weakened.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story fragment &#x27;Understanding of the Overthroned&#x27; senses your gaze.]</div>[Story fragment 'Understanding of the Overthroned' senses your gaze.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her feet, which had been positioned at the right place at the right time, slowed down.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story fragment &#x27;Rabbit&#x27;s Leaping Power&#x27; satisfies your understanding.]</div>[Story fragment 'Rabbit's Leaping Power' satisfies your understanding.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her movements as she jumped back became dull.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t miss that gap and struck her hand holding the iron club hard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The iron club rolled on the floor in vain.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story fragment &#x27;Master of the Twelve Zodiac Signs&#x27; fumbles with its storytelling.]</div>[Story fragment 'Master of the Twelve Zodiac Signs' fumbles with its storytelling.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The effect of the story fragment 「Understanding of the Overthroned」 is very simple.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Becoming the &#x27;only understander&#x27; of the beasts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As long as I have this story fragment, the constellations of the animal kingdom cannot truly be hostile to the being with this story fragment.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story fragment &#x27;Tiger&#x27;s Strength&#x27; stops its storytelling.]</div>[Story fragment 'Tiger's Strength' stops its storytelling.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story fragment &#x27;Rat&#x27;s Footwork&#x27; stops its storytelling.]</div>[Story fragment 'Rat's Footwork' stops its storytelling.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story fragment &#x27;Rabbit&#x27;s Leaping Power&#x27; stops its storytelling.]</div>[Story fragment 'Rabbit's Leaping Power' stops its storytelling.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story fragment &#x27;Master of the Twelve Zodiac Signs&#x27; stops talking.]</div>[Story fragment 'Master of the Twelve Zodiac Signs' stops talking.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Goo Seonah, who was watching the futile collapse of story fragments, suddenly came to her senses, I grabbed her shoulder without missing a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s the end, Goo Seonah-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah&#x27;s knees buckled as she heard the voice filled with [incite]. Nevertheless, she resisted until the end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her lips were tightly clenched. Tears of blood flowed from her eyes glaring at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is unreasonable.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s right. This fight is unfair.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because our &#x27;reading&#x27; and the text given to us were not fair in the first place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know it would end up like this anyway, that expression is annoying.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had nothing to say in protest about this unfair fight. I just hoped she would give up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After struggling for a long time, Goo Seonah finally lowered her head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Stop wasting time and kill me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I won&#x27;t kill you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;re going to kill me anyway, just like you did to Kyungsik.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I didn&#x27;t kill Kyungsik-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#x27;t lie. You—&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Character &#x27;Goo Seonah&#x27; activates &#x27;Lie Detection Lv. 8&#x27;!]</div>[Character 'Goo Seonah' activates 'Lie Detection Lv. 8'!]</p>

<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah looked up at me blankly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Really... You didn&#x27;t kill him?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How many times have I said I didn&#x27;t kill him?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why? You&#x27;re Kim Dokja. Didn&#x27;t you want to be the only Kim Dokja?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s true that my story keeps talking about such things.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, just because my story says so, it doesn&#x27;t mean I have to act accordingly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I just don&#x27;t want this world to end in tragedy.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Goo Seonah seemed to find my answer funny.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you think you have the right to say such things?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You... Do you really not know how this &#x27;world&#x27; came into being?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How could I know that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I see. You still don&#x27;t  have a fragment of &#x27;that memory&#x27;…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah muttered, looking up at the distant sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#x27;t know if you haven&#x27;t gotten it, or if someone is preventing you from regaining that memory…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you know how this world came into being, Seonah-ssi?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you curious?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah began to laugh as if she had just thought of something. As if what was about to happen would be some kind of refreshing revenge against me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Absorb me. Then you will know the answer you were looking for.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I frowned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why? You don&#x27;t like it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Seonah-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aren&#x27;t you curious? Why did your sponsor, which you were looking for so desperately, end up like that? Why did &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27; have to be torn apart into several pieces?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A cool breeze blew down my spine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah was smiling brightly as if she already knew what choice I would make.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why didn&#x27;t the &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27; we knew return to &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;? Aren&#x27;t you really curious?&quot;</p>
