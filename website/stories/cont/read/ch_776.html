<p class="orv_line">&quot;This, this, Private Lee Hyunsu—!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung, foaming at the mouth, had a seizure and collapsed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah&#39;s eyes, watching from afar, widened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I poked Lee Hyunsung&#39;s shoulder as he collapsed. Lee Hyunsung, who had completely lost consciousness, only repeated faint convulsions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I watched him drooling, I thought that this operation would not work. Even if breaking Goo Seonah&#39;s hypnosis was the most urgent task, the characters also had human rights.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly passed Kim Namwoon, Lee Jihye, and Shin Yoosoung and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;From now on.&quot;</p>
[Exclusive skill &#39;Incite Lv.10&#39; is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You all will wake up from hypnosis.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The characters that touched my fingertips convulsed like Lee Hyunsung. But they didn’t foam at the mouth or scream in trauma like that.</p>
[Exclusive skill &#39;Incite Lv. 10&#39; conflicts with &#39;Daily Instigation Lv. 10&#39;!]</p></div>
[Exclusive skill &#39;Incite Lv. 10&#39; conflicts with &#39;Hypnosis Incite Lv. 10&#39;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A spark of probability flew from the air, and soon the characters collapsed on the spot like puppets with their strings cut.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah, who only then realized what I had done, approached me and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;[Incite], I guess you can use it like this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let’s stop now. I can subdue you in the same way.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Me? It won’t work on me? Because [Incite]—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah, who had closed the distance in an instant once again, reached out to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s only effective against opponents with a lower &#39;rank&#39; than you, right?&quot;</p>
「The nail in the corner aimed for my neck. I quickly tilted my upper body back to dodge the attack and activated [Incite] at the same time.」</p></div>
[Exclusive skill &#39;Incite Lv. 10&#39; is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You are now—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The skill was nullified with a sound of &#39;Tsutsut&#39;.</p>
[The activation of &#39;Incite&#39; was canceled.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah was laughing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I told you it wasn&#39;t possible?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, it wasn&#39;t impossible. If her rank wasn&#39;t that far behind, it was theoretically possible to resist [Incite] using 「Insect Massacre」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But even if she had collected a lot of &#39;Kim Dokja Fragments&#39;, would she have a rank that wouldn&#39;t be pushed back by me, the agent of the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I held &#39;Unbreakable Faith&#39; tightly with both hands and released my magical power.</p>
[&#39;Blade of Faith&#39; is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This was a quick and easy decision.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had consumed &#39;Dae-Hwan-Dan&#39; and had sufficient magical power. It would be best to subdue Goo Seonah as quickly as possible and go deal with the Demon Tribe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Goo Seonah was not about to be easily defeated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Dokja insisted on that weapon until the very end. I really didn&#39;t like that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The pure white &#39;Ravelinger&#39; glowed in Goo Seonah&#39;s hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why did he insist on that one when there were so many items?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Blade of Faith&#39; and &#39;Ravelinger&#39; clashed, bathing the place in bright light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Ravelinger&#39; is a weapon that exerts power beyond that of a holy relic in this world.</p>
[Character &#39;Goo Seonah&#39; activates the skill &#39;Moonlight Sword Technique Lv. 10&#39;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Moonlight Sword Technique.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sword technique that Bihyung first recommended, and one that Kim Dokja did not purchase.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah chose that sword technique and learned it. As if to prove that Kim Dokja was wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The path that Kim Dokja took is not the only right one.&quot;</p>
[Moonlight Sword Technique, whose proficiency was at its peak, stabbed my shoulder and thigh. I barely activated Baekcheongganggi to block the attack, and then I saw the iron club held in Goo Seonah&#39;s left hand.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Her main weapon that made her known as the &#39;Iron Club Lady&#39;.</p>
[Character &#39;Goo Seonah&#39; activates the skill &#39;Cheonryeongchu Lv.10&#39;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The iron club flying in from a certain direction narrowed my range of movement, and there was no room to dodge [Moonlight Sword Technique].</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if it had been waiting, the Ravelinger emitted light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A vein burst from my chest and pain consumed my mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Your physique is terrible. Your combat proficiency is also low. How on earth have you survived until now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah continued to push me as if mocking me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you by any chance a one-trick pony like Kim Dokja?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized something new.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We all read the same story of the world, but the way we understand it is different. There is no guarantee that someone who reads the same book repeatedly will necessarily &#39;read&#39; better.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps someone who reads it once can understand the story better than someone who reads it a hundred times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And this was Goo Seonah&#39;s reading.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reading that only &#39;Goo Seonah&#39; experienced, and that I and other readers did not experience.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She survived in this world with that experience. Learning the Wolyeonggeom method with one hand and Cheonchu with the other.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the point where she was competing on equal footing with me, the agent of the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;, her reading was already proven.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She barely achieved the same level as my story after fighting with &#39;gods of the other world&#39; and fighting a life-or-death battle. Of course, the way she formed her &#39;level&#39; was somewhat different from mine.</p>
「She supplemented the insufficient quality of the story with the quantity of the stories, and strengthened the cohesion of the story with &#39;Kim Dokja Fragments&#39;.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The small stories embedded in her entire body were talking to me as if they were screaming.</p>
[The story &#39;The Exciting Nail&#39; wants to imitate you!]</p></div>
[The story &#39;Rice Cake, More Rice Cake than Meat&#39; looks at you.]</p></div>
[The story &#39;A Brick House That&#39;s Good for Hiding&#39; shows interest in you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Tiger Eating Rice Cakes. The Rat Eating Nails. The Dog Throwing Itself into a Flame. The Pig Living in a Brick House...</p>
<p class="orv_line">The stories of the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; constellations were inhabiting her body and forming a single constellation.</p>
[The story &#39;Master of the Twelve Zodiac Signs&#39; shines brightly.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That was the story she had.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story, 「Master of the Twelve Zodiac Signs」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A story that ties together the stories of the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; that were scattered everywhere.</p>
「The Wisdom of Animals to Fight Against the Tale of the Great with the Power of Great People.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Thus, the leader of the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt;, who had never been born in the main story of &#39;Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint&#39;—was momentarily revealed before my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I won&#39;t lose.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard those words, I felt a sense of realization. How long had she planned this stage?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will never do that to you. Even without items! Even without colleagues!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah, gritting her teeth and swinging her blade and iron club, was fierce. The history she lived left fatal scars all over my body.</p>
「Wow, this chapter was really fun!」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">One, and then another, as each and every slash increased, I thought of the comments she left.</p>
「But does he like Yoo Sangah or Han Sooyoung?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">She was the reader who liked Kim Dokja more than anyone else—Kim Dokja&#39;s choice.</p>
「Wow, I would never have done that if it were me. As expected of Kim Dokja!!」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t know what made her so sad. That&#39;s why I wanted to understand her anger.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was curious about her purpose and motivation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even at this moment, when I was enduring such intense attacks.</p>
「I was thinking that I even wanted to write this story.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aaaaaaaah—!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah&#39;s kick, seizing the opportunity, struck my abdomen. The moment my breath caught in my throat, the iron club aimed at my heart moved.</p>
「How much effort did Goo Seonah have to put in to become this strong?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">All of her actions turned into sentences in my head. I even thought that it wouldn&#39;t be bad to die here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Strangely, what came to mind at that moment was the face of Yoo Jonghyuk in the 41st round.</p>
「&quot;As long as you don&#39;t give up on life, I will continue to use you.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I still haven&#39;t kept my promise from back then. I promised not to make this story a tragedy, so I can&#39;t die yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I can&#39;t die.</p>
[The &#39;Blade of Faith&#39; burns brightly!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I concentrated my saved magic power and struck the iron club with the blade. I put strength into my heel and took a stance, then felt the wind blowing.</p>
[Way of the Wind.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah&#39;s body staggered in the fierce wind that swept in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The stories of the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; howled loudly throughout Goo Seonah&#39;s body.</p>
「The Rat&#39;s Dexterity」</p></div>
「The Tiger&#39;s Strength」</p></div>
「The Rabbit&#39;s Leaping Power」</p></div>
「The Snake&#39;s Recovery Power」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">...</p>
<p class="orv_line">When the fragments of the stories of the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; simultaneously raised their voices, my head felt dizzy. However, I also had a &#39;story fragment&#39; for moments like this.</p>
[Story fragment, &#39;Understanding of the Unemployed&#39; begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Story fragments obtained in exchange for clearing Zone 13.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There, I helped animals that had lost their homes, had lost their way, or had lost their stories.</p>
「Understanding of the Unemployed.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And in return for that help, I barely managed to obtain a line of understanding.</p>
[Story fragment &#39;The Tiger&#39;s Strength&#39; senses your gaze.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah&#39;s muscular strength, which had been running towards me, rapidly weakened.</p>
[Story fragment &#39;Understanding of the Overthroned&#39; senses your gaze.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Her feet, which had been positioned at the right place at the right time, slowed down.</p>
[Story fragment &#39;Rabbit&#39;s Leaping Power&#39; satisfies your understanding.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Her movements as she jumped back became dull.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t miss that gap and struck her hand holding the iron club hard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The iron club rolled on the floor in vain.</p>
[Story fragment &#39;Master of the Twelve Zodiac Signs&#39; fumbles with its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The effect of the story fragment 「Understanding of the Overthroned」 is very simple.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Becoming the &#39;only understander&#39; of the beasts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As long as I have this story fragment, the constellations of the animal kingdom cannot truly be hostile to the being with this story fragment.</p>
[Story fragment &#39;Tiger&#39;s Strength&#39; stops its storytelling.]</p></div>
[Story fragment &#39;Rat&#39;s Footwork&#39; stops its storytelling.]</p></div>
[Story fragment &#39;Rabbit&#39;s Leaping Power&#39; stops its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
[Story fragment &#39;Master of the Twelve Zodiac Signs&#39; stops talking.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Goo Seonah, who was watching the futile collapse of story fragments, suddenly came to her senses, I grabbed her shoulder without missing a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s the end, Goo Seonah-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah&#39;s knees buckled as she heard the voice filled with [incite]. Nevertheless, she resisted until the end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her lips were tightly clenched. Tears of blood flowed from her eyes glaring at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is unreasonable.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s right. This fight is unfair.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because our &#39;reading&#39; and the text given to us were not fair in the first place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know it would end up like this anyway, that expression is annoying.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had nothing to say in protest about this unfair fight. I just hoped she would give up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After struggling for a long time, Goo Seonah finally lowered her head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Stop wasting time and kill me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I won&#39;t kill you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re going to kill me anyway, just like you did to Kyungsik.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I didn&#39;t kill Kyungsik-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#39;t lie. You—&quot;</p>
[Character &#39;Goo Seonah&#39; activates &#39;Lie Detection Lv. 8&#39;!]</p></div>
[Character &#39;Goo Seonah&#39; confirms that what you said is true.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah looked up at me blankly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Really... You didn&#39;t kill him?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How many times have I said I didn&#39;t kill him?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why? You&#39;re Kim Dokja. Didn&#39;t you want to be the only Kim Dokja?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s true that my story keeps talking about such things.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, just because my story says so, it doesn&#39;t mean I have to act accordingly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I just don&#39;t want this world to end in tragedy.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Goo Seonah seemed to find my answer funny.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you think you have the right to say such things?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You... Do you really not know how this &#39;world&#39; came into being?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How could I know that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I see. You still don&#39;t  have a fragment of &#39;that memory&#39;…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah muttered, looking up at the distant sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t know if you haven&#39;t gotten it, or if someone is preventing you from regaining that memory…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you know how this world came into being, Seonah-ssi?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you curious?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah began to laugh as if she had just thought of something. As if what was about to happen would be some kind of refreshing revenge against me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Absorb me. Then you will know the answer you were looking for.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I frowned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why? You don&#39;t like it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Seonah-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aren&#39;t you curious? Why did your sponsor, which you were looking for so desperately, end up like that? Why did &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; have to be torn apart into several pieces?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A cool breeze blew down my spine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah was smiling brightly as if she already knew what choice I would make.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why didn&#39;t the &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; we knew return to &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;? Aren&#39;t you really curious?&quot;</p>
