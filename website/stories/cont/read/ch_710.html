<p class="orv_line">Cheok Jungyeong&#x27;s first Japanese meal that serves a thousand people at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ilgeomchamcheon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was familiar with its grandeur and performance. Because I wrote that sentence with my own hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When was it? Was it when Kim Dokja, who was imprisoned in [Hundred Days of Seal], borrowed &#x27;Ganpyeongui&#x27; and summoned Cheok Jungyeong?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「A swordsmanship cultivated over a lifetime by a great genius who may only appear once every tens of thousands of years. The most ideal cut created solely for destruction.」</div>「A swordsmanship cultivated over a lifetime by a great genius who may only appear once every tens of thousands of years. The most ideal cut created solely for destruction.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">But now that I look at it, I feel like I need to change that sentence a bit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why didn&#x27;t I write down that it hurts to use it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">No. Did I write it down? If it was written, it was insufficient.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It felt like someone had bent all my joints in a way that made them impossible to move. Even though [Omniscient Reader&#x27;s Viewpoint] was activated, the pain was felt right down to my soul.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at my tattered right hand, I wondered how on earth Kim Dokja could endure something like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—This is barely a sword, youngest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s barely like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So, just what level of destructive power are Cheok Jungyeong&#x27;s three swords and the four swords created after that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That Cheok Jungyeong was also blocked at &#x27;great-grade&#x27;. The guys you have to deal with in the future are higher than that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I can&#x27;t even guess.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What kind of story must we build to reach that place? Is it really possible to reach it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">How was it possible for Kim Dokja not to be scared even when facing that high sky?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You can do it. Because we already did it once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The thick dust cleared and there was only one constellation left where the blade passed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[How...]</div>[How...]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The six brilliantly shining stars of &lt;Asgard&gt; have set.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is only one thing left. Only &#x27;Valkyrie&#x27;s Daughter&#x27; remained. Even then, more than half of her incarnation body was blown away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As her spear, which had been resting on the floor, scattered into powder, Valkyrie&#x27;s Daughter fell to the ground.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This technique is definitely that monster&#x27;s...]</div>[This technique is definitely that monster's...]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The trembling woman also seemed to recognize Cheok Jungyeong&#x27;s sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheok Jungyeong, like Kim Dokja, was cursed with [Fate] and became an enemy of the giant nebula, so it was no surprise that Valkyrie&#x27;s Daughter recognized this technique.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Afterwards, Valkyrie&#x27;s Daughter, whose magic power flowed back, began to vomit.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Oh, no. It can&#x27;t end like this—]</div>[Oh, no. It can't end like this—]</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Ginnungagap&#x27; ends.]</div>['Ginnungagap' ends.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt the curtain surrounding me disappear. The curtain of &#x27;Ginnungagap&#x27; staged in &lt;Asgard&gt; is finally about to disappear.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The effect of &#x27;Ginnungagap&#x27; is activated.]</div>[The effect of 'Ginnungagap' is activated.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">The curtain disappeared, revealing the ruined city of Washington. The incarnations nearby looked at each other blankly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Valkyrie&#x27;s Daughter, who had not yet been lifted from &#x27;half-body advent&#x27;, also looked embarrassed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[How on earth did this happen...]</div>[How on earth did this happen...]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason that &#x27;half-body advent&#x27; was not lifted is probably because the power of &#x27;Valkyrie’s Daughter&#x27; was damaged.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What was puzzling was her reaction.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Wh-where has everyone gone! Constellations, what&#x27;s going on! Why me—]</div>[Wh-where has everyone gone! Constellations, what's going on! Why me—]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Valkyrie&#x27;s daughter, who had been spouting off a bunch of stories, croaked. It seems as if she had forgotten all previous events.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She wasn&#x27;t the only one having this strange reaction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheon Inho?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, who had been watching the battle by my side, was asking with a confused look on her face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What on earth happened? Why is Valkyrie’s daughter…? No, these traces…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, Anna activated [Past Tense]. But all that came back was a light spark.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Afterwards, it was felt that the incarnations of the area were shaking in confusion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What happened to the Black Beast?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What? Why am I here…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The black beast has fallen!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s a constellation! A constellation has descended!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I feel like my head is going to explode.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">What happened inside &#x27;Ginnungagap&#x27; is not recorded. However, this &#x27;record&#x27; apparently also included the &#x27;memories&#x27; of humans and constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, who had been staring blankly into space, came to her senses and muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No way... &#x27;Ginnungagap&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was also a prophet. Did she realize what had happened in that short period of time?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, it was disappointing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fact that everything that happened in &#x27;Ginnungagap&#x27; was not recorded also meant that the things that happened there could not be made into stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was unfair that the incident of executing as many as ten &#x27;great-grade constellations&#x27; was not recognized as a story, but somehow they survived.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But when I thought about it, something felt strange.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I remember all the incidents that happened in &#x27;Ginnungagap&#x27;.」</div>「I remember all the incidents that happened in 'Ginnungagap'.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Along with the feeling of my heart becoming cold, I felt the power of the story surrounding Kim Dokja and me.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Since when did it start? &#x27;Valkyrie’s Daughter’s&#x27; expression was grotesquely distorted as she looked at me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Nonsense—How to do &#x27;Ginnungagap&#x27;?]</div>[Nonsense—How to do 'Ginnungagap'?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">She also realized what was happening.</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[Stop it! Constellations! We must kill him quickly! Right now!]</div>[Stop it! Constellations! We must kill him quickly! Right now!]</p>

<p class="orv_line">What it meant was clear.</p>

<p class="orv_line">I said, suppressing my overflowing heart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Constellation-nim.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this incident is recognized as a &#x27;story&#x27;, I will get a story about the massacre of &#x27;ten great-grade constellations&#x27; in the seventh scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An impossible story told on a stage where recording is impossible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An achievement that not even Kim Dokja in the main story could achieve.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#x27;t even guess what kind of story I was going to receive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Kim Dokja—that is, the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27;—looked strangely reluctant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—This is not good.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;It&#x27;s not good?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Youngest, do you remember that I was given [fate]?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course I remember.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because of the [fate] he received at that time, Kim Dokja died several times and was even expelled from the scenario in the tenth scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That was the &#x27;eight scenario&#x27;. But if this happens in only the seventh scenario, what do you think the giant nebulae will look like?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Ah...&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Shit. I thought it would be okay because it was &#x27;Ginnungagap&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered what the &#x27;giant nebulae&#x27; were.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this &lt;Star Stream&gt;, these guys are more serious about the fight for food than anyone else. They were the ones who called on [Fate] to stop Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There&#x27;s no way those guys would just sit by and watch us, who defeated ten &#x27;great-grade constellations&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The intervals between thunder sounds, as if representing our anxiety, were becoming shorter and shorter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked, swallowing my ominousness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Are they going to deploy additional constellations?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Asgard&gt; would have suffered enormous losses just by bringing in &#x27;Ginnungagap&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to believe that no matter how large the nebula was, it would be difficult to sustain any further damage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It would be nice if not...</p>

<p class="orv_line">With a tremendous recoil, my vision darkened as if a fuse had blown, but slowly recovered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft helped me as I stumbled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheon Inho? Are you okay? Cheon Inho!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded at her and stood upright with her support.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What is this, what happened in &#x27;Ginnungagap&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’ll explain later, but for now, Yoo Jonghyuk—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I said that, light sparks flew throughout my body and my vitality returned, albeit slightly.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint&#x27; is activated again!]</div>['Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is activated again!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Additional probability was paid.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Additional probability?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Something seems wrong. Be careful, youngest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This &#x27;scenario&#x27; is a scenario that balances the scales instead of causing repercussions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fact that extra probability arose on this side meant that someone other than us was using that much probability on the other side of the scale.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What appeared beyond the portal were incarnations in exotic costumes. Judging by the atmosphere they gave off, they seemed to be from the Balkan Peninsula or the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, who discovered them, greeted them first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are they the Greeks incarnation?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">One of the group nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The scenario is already over. You can go back.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was just as Anna Croft said.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The current sub-scenario has ended.]</div>[The current sub-scenario has ended.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk, who became the black beast, has fallen, and the reward for the &#x27;sub-scenario&#x27; is out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It became Kim Dokja’s responsibility.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But now additional personnel have been dispatched?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a bad situation no matter who looked at it. In fact, instead of responding to Anna Croft&#x27;s words, the guys quickly looked around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As expected, &lt;Asgard&gt; came first.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man who found the fallen &#x27;Valkyrie&#x27;s Daughter&#x27; muttered, and the incarnations nearby helped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You bastards. Did you really use &#x27;Ginnungagap&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You paid that price just to deal with one incarnation?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Valkyrie’s Daughter&#x27; growled, her eyes wide.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You guys. Who are you?]</div>[You guys. Who are you?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The angry mantra uttered by &#x27;Valkyrie’s Daughter&#x27; caused an uproar throughout the area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, despite the constellation&#x27;s attack, the incarnations seemed completely unfazed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s pathetic. Even after using &#x27;Ginnungagap&#x27;, you failed.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Clearly they were incarnations. However, no matter how you look at their tone, it was not like incarnations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The enraged &#x27;Valkyrie’s Daughter&#x27; spewed out her mantra once again.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This is the area of &lt;Asgard&gt;! I don’t know who you guys are, but—]</div>[This is the area of <Asgard>! I don’t know who you guys are, but—]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The words of &#x27;Valkyrie’s Daughter&#x27; could not continue. Because her head had already been cut off and sent flying away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Greek man who brushed off his bloody shamshir grinned, held her severed head and shook it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Good things must be shared, friend.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much strength is exhausted, it is a power that can cut down a constellation that has &#x27;half-strengthened&#x27; in one blow.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Gatekeeper of Thebes&#x27; grins.]</div>[The constellation 'Gatekeeper of Thebes' grins.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thebes? Damn it. no way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I know what kind of guys they are.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of &lt;Olympus&gt; are looking at you.]</div>[The constellations of <Olympus> are looking at you.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">After &lt;Asgard&gt;, it&#x27;s &lt;Olympus&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;I think they came looking for fragments too.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I guess there was a rumor that we were a good restaurant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations that appeared were all incarnations of &lt;Olympus&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the flow of probability flowing around, it seems that the constellations of Olympus are controlling the incarnations by raising the synchronization rate to the limit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja borrowed my mouth and said something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You guys seem to be misunderstanding something, but this isn’t &#x27;Holy Demon War&#x27; or &#x27;Gigantomachia&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it is a scenario where the &#x27;scale of probability&#x27; works, there is a degree.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the weight that the scale cannot support rises, the scale will eventually break and the scenario will end in catastrophe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you all here just to be burned to death by lightning? No matter how absurd the odds are—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if to prove Kim Dokja&#x27;s words, lightning flashed in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, a new portal was opening in the place where the lightning flashed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There wasn&#x27;t only one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Incarnations wearing various costumes were popping out one after another from dozens of portals that opened simultaneously.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the nebula &lt;Ghost&gt; are looking at you.]</div>[The constellations of the nebula <Ghost> are looking at you.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">When I checked there, I heard Kim Dokja&#x27;s voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Youngest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Yes.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We began to run away, carrying the fallen Yoo Jonghyuk on our backs.</p>
