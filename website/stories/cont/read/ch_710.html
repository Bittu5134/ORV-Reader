            <div class="orv_title"><h1>710 Episode 26 Star Ladder (6)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Cheok Jungyeong's first Japanese meal that serves a thousand people at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ilgeomchamcheon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was familiar with its grandeur and performance. Because I wrote that sentence with my own hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When was it? Was it when Kim Dokja, who was imprisoned in [Hundred Days of Seal], borrowed 'Ganpyeongui' and summoned Cheok Jungyeong?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 A swordsmanship cultivated over a lifetime by a great genius who may only appear once every tens of thousands of years. The most ideal cut created solely for destruction. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But now that I look at it, I feel like I need to change that sentence a bit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why didn't I write down that it hurts to use it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">No. Did I write it down? If it was written, it was insufficient.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It felt like someone had bent all my joints in a way that made them impossible to move. Even though [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] was activated, the pain was felt right down to my soul.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at my tattered right hand, I wondered how on earth Kim Dokja could endure something like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—This is barely a sword, youngest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's barely like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So, just what level of destructive power are Cheok Jungyeong's three swords and the four swords created after that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That Cheok Jungyeong was also blocked at 'great-grade'. The guys you have to deal with in the future are higher than that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I can't even guess.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What kind of story must we build to reach that place? Is it really possible to reach it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">How was it possible for Kim Dokja not to be scared even when facing that high sky?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You can do it. Because we already did it once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The thick dust cleared and there was only one constellation left where the blade passed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[How...]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The six brilliantly shining stars of &lt;Asgard&gt; have set.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is only one thing left. Only 'Valkyrie's Daughter' remained. Even then, more than half of her incarnation body was blown away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As her spear, which had been resting on the floor, scattered into powder, Valkyrie's Daughter fell to the ground.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This technique is definitely that monster's...]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The trembling woman also seemed to recognize Cheok Jungyeong's sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheok Jungyeong, like Kim Dokja, was cursed with [Fate] and became an enemy of the giant nebula, so it was no surprise that Valkyrie's Daughter recognized this technique.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Afterwards, Valkyrie's Daughter, whose magic power flowed back, began to vomit.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Oh, no. It can't end like this—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Ginnungagap' ends.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt the curtain surrounding me disappear. The curtain of 'Ginnungagap' staged in &lt;Asgard&gt; is finally about to disappear.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The effect of 'Ginnungagap' is activated.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[What happened in 'Ginnungagap' is not recorded in the world line.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The curtain disappeared, revealing the ruined city of Washington. The incarnations nearby looked at each other blankly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Valkyrie's Daughter, who had not yet been lifted from 'half-body advent', also looked embarrassed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[How on earth did this happen...]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The reason that 'half-body advent' was not lifted is probably because the power of 'Valkyrie’s Daughter' was damaged.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What was puzzling was her reaction.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Wh-where has everyone gone! Constellations, what's going on! Why me—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Valkyrie's daughter, who had been spouting off a bunch of stories, croaked. It seems as if she had forgotten all previous events.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She wasn't the only one having this strange reaction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Cheon Inho?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, who had been watching the battle by my side, was asking with a confused look on her face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What on earth happened? Why is Valkyrie’s daughter…? No, these traces…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, Anna activated [Past Tense]. But all that came back was a light spark.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Afterwards, it was felt that the incarnations of the area were shaking in confusion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What happened to the Black Beast?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What? Why am I here…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The black beast has fallen!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s a constellation! A constellation has descended!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I feel like my head is going to explode."</p>
<p class="orv_line">What happened inside 'Ginnungagap' is not recorded. However, this 'record' apparently also included the 'memories' of humans and constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, who had been staring blankly into space, came to her senses and muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No way... 'Ginnungagap'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was also a prophet. Did she realize what had happened in that short period of time?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, it was disappointing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fact that everything that happened in 'Ginnungagap' was not recorded also meant that the things that happened there could not be made into stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was unfair that the incident of executing as many as ten 'great-grade constellations' was not recognized as a story, but somehow they survived.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But when I thought about it, something felt strange.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I remember all the incidents that happened in 'Ginnungagap'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Along with the feeling of my heart becoming cold, I felt the power of the story surrounding Kim Dokja and me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Recorder of Things That Will Disappear' is in effect.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are not affected by the record erasure effect of 'Ginnungagap'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the nebula &lt;Asgard&gt; are greatly embarrassed.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The nebula &lt;Asgard&gt; protests to the Bureau.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your record will be sent to the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your achievements have been recorded in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have achieved an achievement that does not exist!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The &lt;Star Stream&gt; reviews your achievements.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Since when did it start? 'Valkyrie’s Daughter’s' expression was grotesquely distorted as she looked at me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Nonsense—How to do 'Ginnungagap'?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">She also realized what was happening.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She urgently looked up at the sky and burst out with her loud mantra.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Stop it! Constellations! We must kill him quickly! Right now!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Sparks of probability were swirling around 'Valkyrie’s Daughter'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[He remembers everything that happened inside 'Ginnungagap'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What it meant was clear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know why, but the incident we committed was recorded as a 'story'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' requests to view the records.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' requests to view the records.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' requests access to the records.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' requests to view the records.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Tiger Who Eats Rice Cake' requests to view the records.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Endless indirect messages.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Management Bureau is reviewing your 'new story'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I said, suppressing my overflowing heart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Constellation-nim.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this incident is recognized as a 'story', I will get a story about the massacre of 'ten great-grade constellations' in the seventh scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An impossible story told on a stage where recording is impossible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An achievement that not even Kim Dokja in the main story could achieve.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't even guess what kind of story I was going to receive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Kim Dokja—that is, the 'Demon King of Salvation'—looked strangely reluctant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—This is not good.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'It's not good?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Youngest, do you remember that I was given [fate]?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course I remember.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because of the [fate] he received at that time, Kim Dokja died several times and was even expelled from the scenario in the tenth scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That was the 'eight scenario'. But if this happens in only the seventh scenario, what do you think the giant nebulae will look like?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Ah...'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Shit. I thought it would be okay because it was 'Ginnungagap'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered what the 'giant nebulae' were.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this &lt;Star Stream&gt;, these guys are more serious about the fight for food than anyone else. They were the ones who called on [Fate] to stop Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There's no way those guys would just sit by and watch us, who defeated ten 'great-grade constellations'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The intervals between thunder sounds, as if representing our anxiety, were becoming shorter and shorter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked, swallowing my ominousness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Are they going to deploy additional constellations?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Asgard&gt; would have suffered enormous losses just by bringing in 'Ginnungagap'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to believe that no matter how large the nebula was, it would be difficult to sustain any further damage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It would be nice if not...</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Bookmark' is released.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is temporarily disabled.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With a tremendous recoil, my vision darkened as if a fuse had blown, but slowly recovered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft helped me as I stumbled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Cheon Inho? Are you okay? Cheon Inho!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded at her and stood upright with her support.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What is this, what happened in 'Ginnungagap'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’ll explain later, but for now, Yoo Jonghyuk—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I said that, light sparks flew throughout my body and my vitality returned, albeit slightly.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is activated again!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">—Additional probability was paid.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Additional probability?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Something seems wrong. Be careful, youngest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This 'scenario' is a scenario that balances the scales instead of causing repercussions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fact that extra probability arose on this side meant that someone other than us was using that much probability on the other side of the scale.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What appeared beyond the portal were incarnations in exotic costumes. Judging by the atmosphere they gave off, they seemed to be from the Balkan Peninsula or the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, who discovered them, greeted them first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are they the Greeks incarnation?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">One of the group nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The scenario is already over. You can go back."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was just as Anna Croft said.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The current sub-scenario has ended.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk, who became the black beast, has fallen, and the reward for the 'sub-scenario' is out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It became Kim Dokja’s responsibility.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But now additional personnel have been dispatched?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a bad situation no matter who looked at it. In fact, instead of responding to Anna Croft's words, the guys quickly looked around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"As expected, &lt;Asgard&gt; came first."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man who found the fallen 'Valkyrie's Daughter' muttered, and the incarnations nearby helped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You bastards. Did you really use 'Ginnungagap'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You paid that price just to deal with one incarnation?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Valkyrie’s Daughter' growled, her eyes wide.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You guys. Who are you?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The angry mantra uttered by 'Valkyrie’s Daughter' caused an uproar throughout the area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, despite the constellation's attack, the incarnations seemed completely unfazed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s pathetic. Even after using 'Ginnungagap', you failed."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Clearly they were incarnations. However, no matter how you look at their tone, it was not like incarnations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The enraged 'Valkyrie’s Daughter' spewed out her mantra once again.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This is the area of &lt;Asgard&gt;! I don’t know who you guys are, but—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The words of 'Valkyrie’s Daughter' could not continue. Because her head had already been cut off and sent flying away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Greek man who brushed off his bloody shamshir grinned, held her severed head and shook it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Good things must be shared, friend."</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much strength is exhausted, it is a power that can cut down a constellation that has 'half-strengthened' in one blow.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Gatekeeper of Thebes' grins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Thebes? Damn it. no way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I know what kind of guys they are.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of &lt;Olympus&gt; are looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After &lt;Asgard&gt;, it's &lt;Olympus&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I think they came looking for fragments too.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I guess there was a rumor that we were a good restaurant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations that appeared were all incarnations of &lt;Olympus&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the flow of probability flowing around, it seems that the constellations of Olympus are controlling the incarnations by raising the synchronization rate to the limit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja borrowed my mouth and said something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You guys seem to be misunderstanding something, but this isn’t 'Holy Demon War' or 'Gigantomachia'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it is a scenario where the 'scale of probability' works, there is a degree.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the weight that the scale cannot support rises, the scale will eventually break and the scenario will end in catastrophe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you all here just to be burned to death by lightning? No matter how absurd the odds are—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if to prove Kim Dokja's words, lightning flashed in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, a new portal was opening in the place where the lightning flashed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There wasn't only one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Incarnations wearing various costumes were popping out one after another from dozens of portals that opened simultaneously.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the nebula &lt;Ghost&gt; are looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Ghost&gt;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the nebula &lt;Tree of Protection&gt; are looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Tree of Protection&gt;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the nebula &lt;Vedas&gt; are looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">...&lt;Vedas&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I checked there, I heard Kim Dokja's voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Youngest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Yes.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">We began to run away, carrying the fallen Yoo Jonghyuk on our backs.</p>
