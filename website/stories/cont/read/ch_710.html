        <article class="orv_main">
            <div class="orv_title"><h1>710 Episode 26 Star Ladder (6)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Cheok Jungyeong&#39;s first Japanese meal that serves a thousand people at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ilgeomchamcheon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was familiar with its grandeur and performance. Because I wrote that sentence with my own hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When was it? Was it when Kim Dokja, who was imprisoned in [Hundred Days of Seal], borrowed &#39;Ganpyeongui&#39; and summoned Cheok Jungyeong?</p>
「A swordsmanship cultivated over a lifetime by a great genius who may only appear once every tens of thousands of years. The most ideal cut created solely for destruction.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But now that I look at it, I feel like I need to change that sentence a bit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why didn&#39;t I write down that it hurts to use it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">No. Did I write it down? If it was written, it was insufficient.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It felt like someone had bent all my joints in a way that made them impossible to move. Even though [Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint] was activated, the pain was felt right down to my soul.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at my tattered right hand, I wondered how on earth Kim Dokja could endure something like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—This is barely a sword, youngest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s barely like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So, just what level of destructive power are Cheok Jungyeong&#39;s three swords and the four swords created after that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That Cheok Jungyeong was also blocked at &#39;great-grade&#39;. The guys you have to deal with in the future are higher than that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I can&#39;t even guess.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What kind of story must we build to reach that place? Is it really possible to reach it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">How was it possible for Kim Dokja not to be scared even when facing that high sky?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You can do it. Because we already did it once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The thick dust cleared and there was only one constellation left where the blade passed.</p>
[How...]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The six brilliantly shining stars of &lt;Asgard&gt; have set.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is only one thing left. Only &#39;Valkyrie&#39;s Daughter&#39; remained. Even then, more than half of her incarnation body was blown away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As her spear, which had been resting on the floor, scattered into powder, Valkyrie&#39;s Daughter fell to the ground.</p>
[This technique is definitely that monster&#39;s...]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The trembling woman also seemed to recognize Cheok Jungyeong&#39;s sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheok Jungyeong, like Kim Dokja, was cursed with [Fate] and became an enemy of the giant nebula, so it was no surprise that Valkyrie&#39;s Daughter recognized this technique.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Afterwards, Valkyrie&#39;s Daughter, whose magic power flowed back, began to vomit.</p>
[Oh, no. It can&#39;t end like this—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And.</p>
[&#39;Ginnungagap&#39; ends.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt the curtain surrounding me disappear. The curtain of &#39;Ginnungagap&#39; staged in &lt;Asgard&gt; is finally about to disappear.</p>
[The effect of &#39;Ginnungagap&#39; is activated.]</p></div>
[What happened in &#39;Ginnungagap&#39; is not recorded in the world line.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The curtain disappeared, revealing the ruined city of Washington. The incarnations nearby looked at each other blankly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Valkyrie&#39;s Daughter, who had not yet been lifted from &#39;half-body advent&#39;, also looked embarrassed.</p>
[How on earth did this happen...]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The reason that &#39;half-body advent&#39; was not lifted is probably because the power of &#39;Valkyrie’s Daughter&#39; was damaged.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What was puzzling was her reaction.</p>
[Wh-where has everyone gone! Constellations, what&#39;s going on! Why me—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Valkyrie&#39;s daughter, who had been spouting off a bunch of stories, croaked. It seems as if she had forgotten all previous events.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She wasn&#39;t the only one having this strange reaction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheon Inho?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, who had been watching the battle by my side, was asking with a confused look on her face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What on earth happened? Why is Valkyrie’s daughter…? No, these traces…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, Anna activated [Past Tense]. But all that came back was a light spark.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Afterwards, it was felt that the incarnations of the area were shaking in confusion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What happened to the Black Beast?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What? Why am I here…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The black beast has fallen!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s a constellation! A constellation has descended!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I feel like my head is going to explode.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">What happened inside &#39;Ginnungagap&#39; is not recorded. However, this &#39;record&#39; apparently also included the &#39;memories&#39; of humans and constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, who had been staring blankly into space, came to her senses and muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No way... &#39;Ginnungagap&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was also a prophet. Did she realize what had happened in that short period of time?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, it was disappointing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fact that everything that happened in &#39;Ginnungagap&#39; was not recorded also meant that the things that happened there could not be made into stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was unfair that the incident of executing as many as ten &#39;great-grade constellations&#39; was not recognized as a story, but somehow they survived.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But when I thought about it, something felt strange.</p>
「I remember all the incidents that happened in &#39;Ginnungagap&#39;.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Along with the feeling of my heart becoming cold, I felt the power of the story surrounding Kim Dokja and me.</p>
[The story &#39;Recorder of Things That Will Disappear&#39; is in effect.]</p></div>
[You are not affected by the record erasure effect of &#39;Ginnungagap&#39;.]</p></div>
[The constellations of the nebula &lt;Asgard&gt; are greatly embarrassed.]</p></div>
[The nebula &lt;Asgard&gt; protests to the Bureau.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
[Your record will be sent to the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.]</p></div>
[Your achievements have been recorded in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.]</p></div>
[You have achieved an achievement that does not exist!]</p></div>
[The &lt;Star Stream&gt; reviews your achievements.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Since when did it start? &#39;Valkyrie’s Daughter’s&#39; expression was grotesquely distorted as she looked at me.</p>
[Nonsense—How to do &#39;Ginnungagap&#39;?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">She also realized what was happening.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She urgently looked up at the sky and burst out with her loud mantra.</p>
[Stop it! Constellations! We must kill him quickly! Right now!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Sparks of probability were swirling around &#39;Valkyrie’s Daughter&#39;.</p>
[He remembers everything that happened inside &#39;Ginnungagap&#39;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What it meant was clear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know why, but the incident we committed was recorded as a &#39;story&#39;.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Abyssal Black Flame Dragon&#39; requests to view the records.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Demon-like Judge of Fire&#39; requests to view the records.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Prisoner of the Golden Headband&#39; requests access to the records.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Commander of the Red Cosmos&#39; requests to view the records.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Tiger Who Eats Rice Cake&#39; requests to view the records.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Endless indirect messages.</p>
[The Management Bureau is reviewing your &#39;new story&#39;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I said, suppressing my overflowing heart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Constellation-nim.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this incident is recognized as a &#39;story&#39;, I will get a story about the massacre of &#39;ten great-grade constellations&#39; in the seventh scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An impossible story told on a stage where recording is impossible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An achievement that not even Kim Dokja in the main story could achieve.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#39;t even guess what kind of story I was going to receive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Kim Dokja—that is, the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;—looked strangely reluctant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—This is not good.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;It&#39;s not good?&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Youngest, do you remember that I was given [fate]?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course I remember.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because of the [fate] he received at that time, Kim Dokja died several times and was even expelled from the scenario in the tenth scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That was the &#39;eight scenario&#39;. But if this happens in only the seventh scenario, what do you think the giant nebulae will look like?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Ah...&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Shit. I thought it would be okay because it was &#39;Ginnungagap&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered what the &#39;giant nebulae&#39; were.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this &lt;Star Stream&gt;, these guys are more serious about the fight for food than anyone else. They were the ones who called on [Fate] to stop Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There&#39;s no way those guys would just sit by and watch us, who defeated ten &#39;great-grade constellations&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The intervals between thunder sounds, as if representing our anxiety, were becoming shorter and shorter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked, swallowing my ominousness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Are they going to deploy additional constellations?&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Asgard&gt; would have suffered enormous losses just by bringing in &#39;Ginnungagap&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to believe that no matter how large the nebula was, it would be difficult to sustain any further damage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It would be nice if not...</p>
[&#39;Bookmark&#39; is released.]</p></div>
[&#39;Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint&#39; is temporarily disabled.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With a tremendous recoil, my vision darkened as if a fuse had blown, but slowly recovered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft helped me as I stumbled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheon Inho? Are you okay? Cheon Inho!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded at her and stood upright with her support.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What is this, what happened in &#39;Ginnungagap&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’ll explain later, but for now, Yoo Jonghyuk—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I said that, light sparks flew throughout my body and my vitality returned, albeit slightly.</p>
[&#39;Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint&#39; is activated again!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">—Additional probability was paid.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Additional probability?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Something seems wrong. Be careful, youngest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This &#39;scenario&#39; is a scenario that balances the scales instead of causing repercussions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fact that extra probability arose on this side meant that someone other than us was using that much probability on the other side of the scale.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What appeared beyond the portal were incarnations in exotic costumes. Judging by the atmosphere they gave off, they seemed to be from the Balkan Peninsula or the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, who discovered them, greeted them first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are they the Greeks incarnation?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">One of the group nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The scenario is already over. You can go back.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was just as Anna Croft said.</p>
[The current sub-scenario has ended.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk, who became the black beast, has fallen, and the reward for the &#39;sub-scenario&#39; is out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It became Kim Dokja’s responsibility.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But now additional personnel have been dispatched?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a bad situation no matter who looked at it. In fact, instead of responding to Anna Croft&#39;s words, the guys quickly looked around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As expected, &lt;Asgard&gt; came first.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man who found the fallen &#39;Valkyrie&#39;s Daughter&#39; muttered, and the incarnations nearby helped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You bastards. Did you really use &#39;Ginnungagap&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You paid that price just to deal with one incarnation?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Valkyrie’s Daughter&#39; growled, her eyes wide.</p>
[You guys. Who are you?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The angry mantra uttered by &#39;Valkyrie’s Daughter&#39; caused an uproar throughout the area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, despite the constellation&#39;s attack, the incarnations seemed completely unfazed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s pathetic. Even after using &#39;Ginnungagap&#39;, you failed.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Clearly they were incarnations. However, no matter how you look at their tone, it was not like incarnations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The enraged &#39;Valkyrie’s Daughter&#39; spewed out her mantra once again.</p>
[This is the area of &lt;Asgard&gt;! I don’t know who you guys are, but—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The words of &#39;Valkyrie’s Daughter&#39; could not continue. Because her head had already been cut off and sent flying away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Greek man who brushed off his bloody shamshir grinned, held her severed head and shook it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Good things must be shared, friend.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much strength is exhausted, it is a power that can cut down a constellation that has &#39;half-strengthened&#39; in one blow.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Gatekeeper of Thebes&#39; grins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Thebes? Damn it. no way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I know what kind of guys they are.</p>
[The constellations of &lt;Olympus&gt; are looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After &lt;Asgard&gt;, it&#39;s &lt;Olympus&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;I think they came looking for fragments too.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I guess there was a rumor that we were a good restaurant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations that appeared were all incarnations of &lt;Olympus&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the flow of probability flowing around, it seems that the constellations of Olympus are controlling the incarnations by raising the synchronization rate to the limit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja borrowed my mouth and said something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You guys seem to be misunderstanding something, but this isn’t &#39;Holy Demon War&#39; or &#39;Gigantomachia&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it is a scenario where the &#39;scale of probability&#39; works, there is a degree.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the weight that the scale cannot support rises, the scale will eventually break and the scenario will end in catastrophe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you all here just to be burned to death by lightning? No matter how absurd the odds are—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if to prove Kim Dokja&#39;s words, lightning flashed in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, a new portal was opening in the place where the lightning flashed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There wasn&#39;t only one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Incarnations wearing various costumes were popping out one after another from dozens of portals that opened simultaneously.</p>
[The constellations of the nebula &lt;Ghost&gt; are looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Ghost&gt;.</p>
[The constellations of the nebula &lt;Tree of Protection&gt; are looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Tree of Protection&gt;.</p>
[The constellations of the nebula &lt;Vedas&gt; are looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">...&lt;Vedas&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I checked there, I heard Kim Dokja&#39;s voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Youngest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Yes.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We began to run away, carrying the fallen Yoo Jonghyuk on our backs.</p>
