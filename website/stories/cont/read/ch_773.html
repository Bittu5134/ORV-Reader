            <div class="orv_title"><h1>773 Episode 34 Sibling (4)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">The condition for activating [Time of Judgment] of the Ten Demon Judges is simple.</p>
「Get support from constellations within the same channel.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The important thing here is that not all &#39;constellations within the same channel&#39; need to agree.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unlike the &#39;Judge of Evil&#39;s&#39; [Time of Judgment], which does not activate even if only one of the &#39;Absolute Good&#39; constellations opposes it, the [Time of Judgment] of the &#39;Judge of Destruction&#39; can be activated even if only one constellation agrees.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Demon King of Salvation (Agent)&#39; has agreed to the activation of the Time of Judgment.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, [Time of Judgment] can be activated even if there is only one constellation that agrees within the channel.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Plague Rat&#39; opposes the activation of &#39;Time of Judgment&#39;!]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Serpent Cutting Its Tail&#39; opposes the activation of &#39;Time of Judgment&#39;!]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;dog that threw itself into the flames&#39; opposes the activation of &#39;Time of Judgment&#39;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, there was opposition from the beggars. But there is no use in opposing it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I agreed, so what are you going to do?</p>
[&#39;Time of Judgment&#39; begins!]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;rat that brings plague&#39; opens its eyes!]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;the snake cutting off its tail&#39; cannot hide its embarrassment.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It felt good to see the astonished constellations, but in fact, it was not a very favorable situation for us.</p>
「The characteristics of the three great judges all have something in common: they borrow the probability of &#39;constellations&#39;.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The judge judges the object on behalf of the will of the constellations, and the constellations pay an appropriate probability.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was the probability.</p>
[Currently, there is only one constellation within the channel that has agreed to the time of judgment.]</p></div>
[There is insufficient probability.]</p></div>
[The popularity of &#39;Time of Judgment&#39; is low.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Since &#39;Judgment of Ten Demons&#39; is easy to activate [Time of Judgment], its effect greatly depends on the level or number of people who agree to activate the skill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In short, right now, Jung Heewon could only borrow the probability of the &#39;Demon King of Salvation (acting agent)&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsk tsk, tsk tsk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surely the skill won&#39;t end before she even fights properly?</p>
<p class="orv_line">A high-level demon holding the &#39;Wolgeuk&#39;—the &#39;Spear Master&#39; muttered while holding Jung Heewon’s collar.</p>
[Interesting. I never thought there would be an incarnation with the &#39;judge&#39; trait.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I spoke to that guy using Jung Heewon’s words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The level of the Gourmet Association has fallen a lot. They even accept lowly  great-grades like you as  &#39;Gourmet Association&#39; members.&quot;</p>
[Are you crazy?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at his expression, it seemed like I had really touched the point.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I guess so. In fact, these guys are probably not mainstream &#39;Gourmet Association&#39; members, but rather subcontractors.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, this means that these are the people who supply items such as the &#39;Heart of a 10th Circle Grand Mage&#39; or &#39;The Right Arm of a Poor Sword Master&#39; that are being eaten up by the Gourmet Association.</p>
[Something like a kid with no background—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you ignoring the Demon King of Salvation?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Without hesitation, I put my strength on my back foot. As expected from a born swordsman, her muscle movements were extraordinary.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Spear Master&#39; gave an order as if he was annoyed by the rapidly narrowing distance.</p>
[Block it.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Two high-level demons who had been loitering in the back stepped forward as if they had been waiting.</p>
[Master of intestines, how dare you order me?]</p></div>
[I was already planning on eating her!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">One guy seems to have a subspace pouch and appears to be a typical assassin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the other one was wearing battle gauntlets, so it was a martial arts style.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the assassin who moved first. The guy with his cheeks puffed out like a frog spewed green poisonous smoke, creating a swamp around him.</p>
[Advanced demon &#39;Filth Addict&#39; activates &#39;Pollution Zone Lv.10&#39;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Filth addict.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was this guy there too?</p>
<p class="orv_line">This constellation was originally one of the guys who followed Yoo Jonghyuk like a stalker in the middle rounds of &#39;Ways of Survival&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His battle logic is to restrict the opponent&#39;s movement by laying down a contaminated area and then shoot the enemy with an extremely poisonous needle to subdue the enemy.</p>
[It looks good to squeeze!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This guy, who likes to hunt prey with minimal injury, had an eccentric hobby of squeezing out freshly caught prey and eating its contents.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Coincidentally, in &#39;Ways of Survival&#39;, there is a scene where Yoo Jonghyuk subdues that guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To explain it in Yoo Jonghyuk style, the method is as follows.</p>
「One, do not step on &#39;contaminated areas&#39; and use protruding tree trunks as a stepping stone.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s &#39;combat textbook&#39; is difficult for Cheon Inho to follow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what about &#39;Jung Heewon&#39;?</p>
[You’re a quick guy!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I jumped into the air to avoid the contaminated area, it shot something out of its mouth again.</p>
「Two, avoid the &#39;extremely poisonous needle&#39; flying from the air.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">An &#39;extremely poisonous needle&#39; that cuts off half of your combat ability for 10 minutes with just one hit. It was a key skill that allowed the &#39;filth addict&#39; with low combat power to maintain his position as a constellation.</p>
[Exclusive skill &#39;Way of the Wind&#39; is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, it doesn&#39;t work for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the frightened filth addict widened his eyes, I spun around in the air, accelerated, and swung my sword at him.</p>
[Pathetic guy. Go away!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The one who blocked the sword was a martial arts-style high-level demon who narrowly came forward.</p>
[Advanced demon &#39;Wingak Taoist&#39; unleashes his power!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Like the &#39;Spear Master&#39;, he was a constellation from the &lt;First Murim&gt;.</p>
「A person who was once a master in his twenties of the &lt;First Martial Arts&gt;, but sold his clan and martial arts to Seongun and was given the position of &#39;constellation&#39;.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Seeing that he is still living as a subcontractor for the &#39;Gourmet Association&#39;, his habits as a human do not change even if he became a Constellation.</p>
[Maesonga, take it! This is the &#39;Hundred Steps Godly Fists!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, it wasn&#39;t [Hundred Steps Godly Fists]. The real Hundred Steps Godly Fists is not that shabby.</p>
[This is a martial arts skill that brought even the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint to her knees!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If Breaking the Sky Sword Saint were here, there&#39;ll be a sound that would make one&#39;s head fly off at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was no Breaking the Sky Sword Saint here, and it was only Jung Heewon and I who had to deal with him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the face of the explosion  of power that took over the place in an instant, I frantically took a step back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fast.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how constrained the opponent was by the scenario constraints, a constellation was a constellation, and at one time, he was a strong man who was listed as one of the 20 strongest members of &lt;The First Murim&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it&#39;s worth a try.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A trajectory that Cheon Inho could not follow was visible.</p>
[Exclusive skill &#39;Kendo Lv.10&#39; is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Being visible means that there is an opportunity to counterattack as long as the body&#39;s abilities are supported.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gooooooo!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon&#39;s [Kendo], which has already surpassed the level </p>
<p class="orv_line">of transcendence, is filled with the power of swords. A talent who self-taught her sword skills alone and would have undoubtedly competed for the place of the best in the world if she were in the &lt;First Murim&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the lost guard Kwongak took his breath, Jung Heewon and I were already right in front of him.</p>
[What—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sharp sword energy drew a brilliant trajectory to the guy&#39;s fist.</p>
[Kaaaaaa—!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What I can do is utilize all of Jung Heewon&#39;s potential while [Time of Judgment] lasts.</p>
[Exclusive skill &#39;Demon Slayer Lv.10&#39; is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Red natural flowers flickered at the corners of my eyes, and explosive power welled up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I held &#39;Mikazuki Munechika&#39; with both hands and swung it again and again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From top to bottom and from left to right again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You—!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The wrist of the unguarded Kwongak Taoist flew into the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t miss the opportunity and attacked his arms.</p>
[Some constellations are astonished by the fighting power of incarnation &#39;Jung Heewon&#39;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of flesh being torn apart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The panicked Taoist swordsman held onto Munechika Mikazuki&#39;s blade with one hand and unleashed a barrage of punches with the other hand.</p>
[You dare!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was no place to escape unless I let go of the sword. A blow that would explode one&#39;s body with just one hit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, I didn&#39;t let go of the sword. I believed in Jung Heewon’s history.</p>
[Exclusive attribute &#39;Mad Butcher&#39; activates!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Her indomitable trait that made her enter the &#39;100 Strongest People&#39; of the Ways of Survival came into play.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kuddddddd!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon’s body was not broken even by the pouring power. The aura surrounding her entire body burned even more fiercely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the &#39;Gwongak Taoist&#39; screamed, Jung Heewon&#39;s sword moved once again. In addition, it is a sword strike imbued with the ability of [Time of Judgment].</p>
「&quot;I have to become stronger.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">On top of that, there is the time that Jung Heewon has accumulated so far.</p>
「&quot;I have to swing faster and stronger.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I was able to find out what Jung Heewon was thinking of when practicing swordsmanship.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the most beautiful swordsmanship I had ever seen.</p>
「&quot;Only then can I protect Inho-ssi.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon swung her sword again and again to catch up with him.</p>
[Uh, how could it be that the only human in the scenario is—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Each and every sword swung like that came together and finally came together at Jung Heewon&#39;s fingertips.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A level that an ordinary human being can never reach. A wall that even martial arts masters cannot overcome even after training for hundreds of years.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The wall was crumbling in the face of overwhelming talent.</p>
「Transcendent type level 1.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A sword made to break the sword of the King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her kendo blossomed into a brilliant beam of light, splitting the incarnation body of the &#39;Wingak Taoist&#39; in half.</p>
[High-ranking demon &#39;Wingak Taoist&#39; has been killed!]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Wingak Taoist&#39; receives a terrible shock and leaves the scenario!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was impossible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though this is the twentieth scenario, it is a feat in which an incarnation with no sponsor defeats an incarnation possessed by a great-grade constellation.</p>
[The constellations belonging to the Chinese Zodiac are greatly shocked by the power of the incarnation &#39;Jung Heewon&#39;!]</p></div>
[The constellations of the Gourmet Association are making interested expressions!]</p></div>
[A constellation whose modifier has not yet been revealed is watching your battle.]</p></div>
[5,000 coins were sponsored.]</p></div>
[The battle of incarnation &#39;Jung Heewon&#39; is leaked outside the &#39;Recycling Center&#39; through the management bureau!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was no time to get drunk on the joy of victory. Jung Heewon’s body was rapidly becoming heavier.</p>
[There is not enough probability to continue the &#39;Time of Judgment&#39;.]</p></div>
[After a while, the reaction of &#39;madness&#39; will begin.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Without stopping, I swung my sword at the &#39;filth addict&#39; next to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are two demons remaining. Before  I couldn’t move her body at all, I had to kill all the remaining guys.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the &#39;filth addict&#39;, who foresaw his colleague&#39;s defeat, was already running away.</p>
[Damn it! I’ve never heard of such a monster!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Eventually, there was only one demon left.</p>
[How pathetic. The title &#39;Gourmet Association&#39; is a waste, Guru Kwon Gak.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The spear master was glaring at me with cool eyes, as if he wasn&#39;t too shaken by my battle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the next moment, the spear master’s new form disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swung my sword reflexively.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Mikazuki Munechika&#39; broke with a deep sibilant sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The powerful force emitted by the spear master destroyed Jung Heewon&#39;s sword and touched the blade of &#39;Mikazuki Munechika&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A rapid spear attack followed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although it was frustrating, the &#39;spear master&#39;’s skills were real.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unlike the Kwongak master who sold out his sect to Seongun and became a &#39;constellation&#39;, this guy was truly a constellation who achieved great feats with his own skills.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In an instant, blood spurted out from the damaged body.</p>
[&#39;Time of Judgment&#39; ends.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">To make matters worse, [Time of Judgment] has also ended.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Terrible pain radiated from every bone in my body. All I could really do now was stand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The spear master was smiling as if he had already secured victory.</p>
[It’s an amazing talent. If you had trained for ten more years, we could have had an interesting match.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If it had been one more minute, you would have passed out.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By reducing the three high-level demons to one, the goal was achieved.</p>
[I only kept my mouth shut because I thought you were going to die soon.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The spear master&#39;s eyes scanned the entire body of Jung Heewon, whom I had possessed.</p>
[It is a very desirable incarnation. If you want to live, I will give you a chance. If you become my &#39;incarnation&#39;…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The expression of the spear master who had been speaking so far hardened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason was clear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A roar heard from afar. Something was running towards us like a tank, plowing through the forest road.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A pitch-black coat blowing in the wind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Han Sooyoung were here, she would definitely have said this.</p>
「&quot;◼️Ba, as expected, the main character.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I spoke to the high-ranking demon in a triumphant voice, like a fox riding on a tiger&#39;s back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s been a minute, kid.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The eyes of Yoo Jonghyuk, who came running out of breath, were looking in this direction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was clear what the guy saw to ran to us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He must have read the phrase on the &#39;commercial signal flare&#39; I fired earlier.</p>
「Here is a demon king with your &#39;spear&#39;.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Wolgeuk&#39; is Yoo Jonghyuk’s decisive battle weapon for the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From my perspective, it was a stroke of luck that the &#39;spear master&#39; obtained the Wolgeuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yoo Jonghyuk! Here we are!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shouted with all my might in Jung Heewon’s voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Here is the villain of the world who stole your spear—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Spear Master&#39; is a monster that should never be dealt with under normal circumstances, but with Yoo Jonghyuk in the &#39;41st round&#39;, it was an enemy worth fighting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the two of them calmly form a formation to stop them and kill them—</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yoo Jonghyuk?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Yoo Jonghyuk was looking somewhere else without even looking in my direction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he had seen that expression on his face, he would definitely have said this.</p>
「&quot;Isn’t that the look you make when you go to buy dumplings and there aren’t any left?&quot;」</p></div>
