            <div class="orv_title"><h1>773 Episode 34 Sibling (4)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">The condition for activating [Time of Judgment] of the Ten Demon Judges is simple.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Get support from constellations within the same channel. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The important thing here is that not all 'constellations within the same channel' need to agree.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unlike the 'Judge of Evil's' [Time of Judgment], which does not activate even if only one of the 'Absolute Good' constellations opposes it, the [Time of Judgment] of the 'Judge of Destruction' can be activated even if only one constellation agrees.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation (Agent)' has agreed to the activation of the Time of Judgment.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, [Time of Judgment] can be activated even if there is only one constellation that agrees within the channel.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Plague Rat' opposes the activation of 'Time of Judgment'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Serpent Cutting Its Tail' opposes the activation of 'Time of Judgment'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'dog that threw itself into the flames' opposes the activation of 'Time of Judgment'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, there was opposition from the beggars. But there is no use in opposing it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I agreed, so what are you going to do?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Time of Judgment' begins!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'rat that brings plague' opens its eyes!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'the snake cutting off its tail' cannot hide its embarrassment.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It felt good to see the astonished constellations, but in fact, it was not a very favorable situation for us.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The characteristics of the three great judges all have something in common: they borrow the probability of 'constellations'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The judge judges the object on behalf of the will of the constellations, and the constellations pay an appropriate probability.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was the probability.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently, there is only one constellation within the channel that has agreed to the time of judgment.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There is insufficient probability.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The popularity of 'Time of Judgment' is low.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Since 'Judgment of Ten Demons' is easy to activate [Time of Judgment], its effect greatly depends on the level or number of people who agree to activate the skill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In short, right now, Jung Heewon could only borrow the probability of the 'Demon King of Salvation (acting agent)'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsk tsk, tsk tsk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surely the skill won't end before she even fights properly?</p>
<p class="orv_line">A high-level demon holding the 'Wolgeuk'—the 'Spear Master' muttered while holding Jung Heewon’s collar.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Interesting. I never thought there would be an incarnation with the 'judge' trait.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I spoke to that guy using Jung Heewon’s words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The level of the Gourmet Association has fallen a lot. They even accept lowly  great-grades like you as  'Gourmet Association' members."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Are you crazy?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at his expression, it seemed like I had really touched the point.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I guess so. In fact, these guys are probably not mainstream 'Gourmet Association' members, but rather subcontractors.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, this means that these are the people who supply items such as the 'Heart of a 10th Circle Grand Mage' or 'The Right Arm of a Poor Sword Master' that are being eaten up by the Gourmet Association.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Something like a kid with no background—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you ignoring the Demon King of Salvation?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Without hesitation, I put my strength on my back foot. As expected from a born swordsman, her muscle movements were extraordinary.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Spear Master' gave an order as if he was annoyed by the rapidly narrowing distance.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Block it.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Two high-level demons who had been loitering in the back stepped forward as if they had been waiting.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Master of intestines, how dare you order me?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I was already planning on eating her!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">One guy seems to have a subspace pouch and appears to be a typical assassin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the other one was wearing battle gauntlets, so it was a martial arts style.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the assassin who moved first. The guy with his cheeks puffed out like a frog spewed green poisonous smoke, creating a swamp around him.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Advanced demon 'Filth Addict' activates 'Pollution Zone Lv.10'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Filth addict.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was this guy there too?</p>
<p class="orv_line">This constellation was originally one of the guys who followed Yoo Jonghyuk like a stalker in the middle rounds of 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His battle logic is to restrict the opponent's movement by laying down a contaminated area and then shoot the enemy with an extremely poisonous needle to subdue the enemy.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[It looks good to squeeze!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This guy, who likes to hunt prey with minimal injury, had an eccentric hobby of squeezing out freshly caught prey and eating its contents.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Coincidentally, in 'Ways of Survival', there is a scene where Yoo Jonghyuk subdues that guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To explain it in Yoo Jonghyuk style, the method is as follows.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 One, do not step on 'contaminated areas' and use protruding tree trunks as a stepping stone. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk's 'combat textbook' is difficult for Cheon Inho to follow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what about 'Jung Heewon'?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You’re a quick guy!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I jumped into the air to avoid the contaminated area, it shot something out of its mouth again.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Two, avoid the 'extremely poisonous needle' flying from the air. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">An 'extremely poisonous needle' that cuts off half of your combat ability for 10 minutes with just one hit. It was a key skill that allowed the 'filth addict' with low combat power to maintain his position as a constellation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Way of the Wind' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, it doesn't work for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the frightened filth addict widened his eyes, I spun around in the air, accelerated, and swung my sword at him.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Pathetic guy. Go away!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The one who blocked the sword was a martial arts-style high-level demon who narrowly came forward.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Advanced demon 'Wingak Taoist' unleashes his power!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Like the 'Spear Master', he was a constellation from the &lt;First Murim&gt;.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 A person who was once a master in his twenties of the &lt;First Martial Arts&gt;, but sold his clan and martial arts to Seongun and was given the position of 'constellation'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Seeing that he is still living as a subcontractor for the 'Gourmet Association', his habits as a human do not change even if he became a Constellation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Maesonga, take it! This is the 'Hundred Steps Godly Fists!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, it wasn't [Hundred Steps Godly Fists]. The real Hundred Steps Godly Fists is not that shabby.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This is a martial arts skill that brought even the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint to her knees!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If Breaking the Sky Sword Saint were here, there'll be a sound that would make one's head fly off at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was no Breaking the Sky Sword Saint here, and it was only Jung Heewon and I who had to deal with him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the face of the explosion  of power that took over the place in an instant, I frantically took a step back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fast.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how constrained the opponent was by the scenario constraints, a constellation was a constellation, and at one time, he was a strong man who was listed as one of the 20 strongest members of &lt;The First Murim&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it's worth a try.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A trajectory that Cheon Inho could not follow was visible.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Kendo Lv.10' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Being visible means that there is an opportunity to counterattack as long as the body's abilities are supported.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gooooooo!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon's [Kendo], which has already surpassed the level </p>
<p class="orv_line">of transcendence, is filled with the power of swords. A talent who self-taught her sword skills alone and would have undoubtedly competed for the place of the best in the world if she were in the &lt;First Murim&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the lost guard Kwongak took his breath, Jung Heewon and I were already right in front of him.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[What—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sharp sword energy drew a brilliant trajectory to the guy's fist.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Kaaaaaa—!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What I can do is utilize all of Jung Heewon's potential while [Time of Judgment] lasts.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Demon Slayer Lv.10' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Red natural flowers flickered at the corners of my eyes, and explosive power welled up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I held 'Mikazuki Munechika' with both hands and swung it again and again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From top to bottom and from left to right again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You—!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The wrist of the unguarded Kwongak Taoist flew into the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't miss the opportunity and attacked his arms.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some constellations are astonished by the fighting power of incarnation 'Jung Heewon'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of flesh being torn apart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The panicked Taoist swordsman held onto Munechika Mikazuki's blade with one hand and unleashed a barrage of punches with the other hand.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You dare!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was no place to escape unless I let go of the sword. A blow that would explode one's body with just one hit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, I didn't let go of the sword. I believed in Jung Heewon’s history.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive attribute 'Mad Butcher' activates!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Her indomitable trait that made her enter the '100 Strongest People' of the Ways of Survival came into play.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kuddddddd!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon’s body was not broken even by the pouring power. The aura surrounding her entire body burned even more fiercely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the 'Gwongak Taoist' screamed, Jung Heewon's sword moved once again. In addition, it is a sword strike imbued with the ability of [Time of Judgment].</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I have to become stronger." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">On top of that, there is the time that Jung Heewon has accumulated so far.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I have to swing faster and stronger." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I was able to find out what Jung Heewon was thinking of when practicing swordsmanship.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the most beautiful swordsmanship I had ever seen.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Only then can I protect Inho-ssi." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon swung her sword again and again to catch up with him.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Uh, how could it be that the only human in the scenario is—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Each and every sword swung like that came together and finally came together at Jung Heewon's fingertips.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A level that an ordinary human being can never reach. A wall that even martial arts masters cannot overcome even after training for hundreds of years.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The wall was crumbling in the face of overwhelming talent.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Transcendent type level 1. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A sword made to break the sword of the King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her kendo blossomed into a brilliant beam of light, splitting the incarnation body of the 'Wingak Taoist' in half.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[High-ranking demon 'Wingak Taoist' has been killed!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Wingak Taoist' receives a terrible shock and leaves the scenario!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was impossible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though this is the twentieth scenario, it is a feat in which an incarnation with no sponsor defeats an incarnation possessed by a great-grade constellation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations belonging to the Chinese Zodiac are greatly shocked by the power of the incarnation 'Jung Heewon'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the Gourmet Association are making interested expressions!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation whose modifier has not yet been revealed is watching your battle.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[5,000 coins were sponsored.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The battle of incarnation 'Jung Heewon' is leaked outside the 'Recycling Center' through the management bureau!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was no time to get drunk on the joy of victory. Jung Heewon’s body was rapidly becoming heavier.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There is not enough probability to continue the 'Time of Judgment'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[After a while, the reaction of 'madness' will begin.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Without stopping, I swung my sword at the 'filth addict' next to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are two demons remaining. Before  I couldn’t move her body at all, I had to kill all the remaining guys.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the 'filth addict', who foresaw his colleague's defeat, was already running away.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Damn it! I’ve never heard of such a monster!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Eventually, there was only one demon left.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[How pathetic. The title 'Gourmet Association' is a waste, Guru Kwon Gak.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The spear master was glaring at me with cool eyes, as if he wasn't too shaken by my battle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the next moment, the spear master’s new form disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swung my sword reflexively.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Mikazuki Munechika' broke with a deep sibilant sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The powerful force emitted by the spear master destroyed Jung Heewon's sword and touched the blade of 'Mikazuki Munechika'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A rapid spear attack followed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although it was frustrating, the 'spear master'’s skills were real.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unlike the Kwongak master who sold out his sect to Seongun and became a 'constellation', this guy was truly a constellation who achieved great feats with his own skills.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In an instant, blood spurted out from the damaged body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Time of Judgment' ends.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">To make matters worse, [Time of Judgment] has also ended.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Terrible pain radiated from every bone in my body. All I could really do now was stand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The spear master was smiling as if he had already secured victory.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[It’s an amazing talent. If you had trained for ten more years, we could have had an interesting match.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"If it had been one more minute, you would have passed out."</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By reducing the three high-level demons to one, the goal was achieved.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I only kept my mouth shut because I thought you were going to die soon.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The spear master's eyes scanned the entire body of Jung Heewon, whom I had possessed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[It is a very desirable incarnation. If you want to live, I will give you a chance. If you become my 'incarnation'…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The expression of the spear master who had been speaking so far hardened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason was clear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A roar heard from afar. Something was running towards us like a tank, plowing through the forest road.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A pitch-black coat blowing in the wind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Han Sooyoung were here, she would definitely have said this.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "◼️Ba, as expected, the main character." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I spoke to the high-ranking demon in a triumphant voice, like a fox riding on a tiger's back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s been a minute, kid."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The eyes of Yoo Jonghyuk, who came running out of breath, were looking in this direction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was clear what the guy saw to ran to us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He must have read the phrase on the 'commercial signal flare' I fired earlier.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Here is a demon king with your 'spear'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'Wolgeuk' is Yoo Jonghyuk’s decisive battle weapon for the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From my perspective, it was a stroke of luck that the 'spear master' obtained the Wolgeuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Jonghyuk! Here we are!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shouted with all my might in Jung Heewon’s voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Here is the villain of the world who stole your spear—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Spear Master' is a monster that should never be dealt with under normal circumstances, but with Yoo Jonghyuk in the '41st round', it was an enemy worth fighting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the two of them calmly form a formation to stop them and kill them—</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Jonghyuk?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Yoo Jonghyuk was looking somewhere else without even looking in my direction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he had seen that expression on his face, he would definitely have said this.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Isn’t that the look you make when you go to buy dumplings and there aren’t any left?" 」</p></div>
