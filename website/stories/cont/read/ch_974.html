            <div class="orv_title"><h1>974 Episode 58 Mythical Constellation (6)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim End-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only after hearing her voice did I breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Anna."</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Pebble and I doesn't work on anyone who has ever shared the effects of the story. Anna Croft had shared this story with me, so she had found me unaffected by it. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, Anna Croft, who was holding onto my shoulder, seemed to be in a strange state.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you hurt?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna shook her head as if nothing had happened, wiping the blood from her forehead. Judging by her anxious breathing, she seemed to have been chased by someone on the way here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I was about to speak again, Anna Croft placed a finger on her lips and let out an [Electrifying Sound].</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The constellations are coming.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Following this, a group of constellations appeared noisily from the direction Anna Croft had appeared. Perhaps they were the constellations that had been chasing her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The &lt;Emperor&gt;'s forces.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With Anna Croft's voice, I confirmed the constellation leading the charge.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A handsome man, carrying a massive red bow on his back that seemed taller than he was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He wore character pajamas that didn't suit the battlefield, and he looked around, clutching a white arrowhead with a somewhat annoyed and gloomy look in his eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was a constellation I knew well.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Sun Hunter, 'Ye'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A legendary constellation said to have shot down nine suns with his bow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed that the &lt;Emperor&gt;'s forces participating in this battle were following his lead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Were they chasing you?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft shook her head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—To be precise, they helped me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Helped you?</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to Anna, the &lt;Emperor&gt;'s constellations, led by the Sun Hunter, had rescued her from the constellations that surrounded her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The Emperor tried to recruit me. They told me to join their forces in the 'Main Battlefield'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This 'large-scale battlefield' was the major constellations' last chance to recruit the elites of 'Valhalla Hall'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that sense, Prophet Anna Croft would have been a worthy recruit for the Emperor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although she was hated by Asgard, with 'Valhalla Hall' already on the verge of collapse, the Emperor had no reason to worry about the petty positions of other constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Why didn't you just accept? The Emperor would have a chance even in the higher-level scenarios.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft's eyes widened in bewilderment at my answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Are you serious?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Yes. After all, you've been abandoned by Asgard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When we met in the past, in the Fear Realm, she was already being hunted by Asgard. Relying on the Transcendent Alliance was her last resort, but now even the Fear Realm had been destroyed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this point, accepting the love call of another giant nebula might have been a viable survival strategy for her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft shook her head and said,</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I'm sick of the giant nebulae now. And…</p>
<p class="orv_line">She hesitated for a moment, glanced at me, and added,</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You have no intention of joining the giant nebulae, do you?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Of course.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—…We're close. We must also be careful of [Transmission].</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded in response.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Sun Hunter, 'Ye', was a constellation that had reached the Transcendent Realm, just like the First Sword of Goryeo, 'Cheok Jungyeong'. At this close range, it was possible that [Transmission]'s presence could be detected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just then, I heard the Sun Hunter's words, who had just approached.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[What a gloomy battlefield. The souls of the incarnations who perished in despair scream everywhere.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Sun Hunter was briefly mentioned in 'Ways of Survival', but his personality was not clearly described.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Do not weep. In the end, all stars are destined to return to a single dream. Both the brilliant sun and the pebbles on the roadside will ultimately become nothing more than the dust of a story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Judging by his tone, the Sun Hunter Ye seemed to be a rather sentimental constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations, who had just approached him, prostrated themselves and called out to him.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[O Sun Hunter.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Sun Hunter did not answer. He simply gazed into the empty sky, as if lost in deep thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps familiar with the Sun Hunter's appearance, Suha waited silently, without particularly prodding him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, as a star fell from the sky, the Sun Hunter spoke unexpectedly.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I heard there are some Transcendents who escaped the Fear Realm. Have you found any news about them? What about Junkyung? What happened to Namgung Minyoung? Kyrgios?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I was startled by the names he spoke.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I came here to learn about the fate of my comrades.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Oji promised that if you complete your mission, he will mobilize all of the headquarters' intelligence to find the whereabouts of the Transcendents.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'The Five Emperors', he must mean the 'Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors', the mythical constellations of the Emperor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Sun Hunter scoffed at his subordinate's words and replied,</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You're always like that. You've always been like that. You're planning to manipulate me like this again. What kind of star will you tell me to drop this time?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, the Sun Hunter wasn't even present in 'Journey to the West', the main scenario for 'The Emperor'. Just as with Surya and Dionysus, not everyone within the Great Nebula would agree with its will.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps the Sun Hunter was in a similar situation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[So, what is my task?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Emperor has given you two missions. The first is to recruit a prophet from &lt;Asgard&gt;.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Are you referring to the woman who ran away earlier? She doesn't seem to have any intention of joining the &lt;Emperor&gt;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Sun Hunter frowned, seemingly annoyed. His subordinate replied,</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[He said there was no need to force her. She'll naturally learn her situation once she advances to the higher scenarios. She'll realize that hiding behind the starlight of the Nebula is safer.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[It sounds like a mission I can afford to fail.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[But he has told me to fulfill the second mission at all costs.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[What is the second mission?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After a brief pause, Suha opened his mouth.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[We're capturing the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Anna, who was hiding with me, flinched. But I wasn't particularly surprised. This was an expected development.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With the possibility of the 'Round Table' already in motion, there was no reason for the other myth-grade constellations to act independently. Perhaps many constellations with similar objectives to the 'Sun Hunter' had participated in this battle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the moment I heard the following story, I couldn't help but relax.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Emperor of Ojong ordered that he be brought in without fail. He also gave orders that the 'White Arrows' could be used if necessary.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The White Arrows?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I swallowed involuntarily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Sun Hunter, like the First Sword of Goryeo, was a constellation of the story of the Sun, but he possessed one fearsome relic that could pose a threat even to myth-grade constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the ten white-glowing arrows hanging from the Sun Hunter's flank.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 A mythical relic—the 'Ten Fingers of God'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'The one who gave birth to the king of kings'— one of the mythical constellations of &lt;Emperor&gt;, one of the Three Emperors and Five Emperors— is a new thing that was made by cutting the finger of 'Jegok'.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 If I'm hit by that arrow, even I will be in danger. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Sun Hunter, upon hearing the order, looked startled.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Really? You must know what it means to use this arrow.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[It's a clear order.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This arrow can even bring down the stars of calamity. Is that 'Demon King of Salvation' really that great?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I've heard he possesses power beyond the late stage of the narrative-grade, perhaps even the early stage of myth-grade.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[That's a constellation I've never heard of. Is it an outer god? Perhaps not a transcendental constellation?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I heard it's an incarnation.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Sun Hunter looked genuinely surprised. He lightly stroked his bow a few times, then looked away with an inscrutable smile.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[If that's true, then it's interesting.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Was it an illusion that he seemed to look towards the bush where Anna Croft and I were hiding?</p>
<p class="orv_line">He tilted his head for a moment, then looked away and said.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Then let's prepare. We must capture the 'Demon King of Salvation' before the time limit for the first sanctuary runs out.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I was observing the &lt;Emperor&gt;'s movements when something suddenly dawned on me. I asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Did they try to find my location through you? Is that why you ran away from them?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft continued to monitor the Emperor's movements, saying,</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I just didn't want to be played by the stars anymore.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I ran away, leaving Kim Anna alone in this situation, I'd be forever subjected to the savage beatings of those little Kim Dokjas.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I maintained 「Pebble and I」, grabbed Anna Croft's wrist, and began to move.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, the Emperor's forces were unaware of our movements.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—First, we need to find Heewon-ssi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The most urgent task now is to confirm Jung Heewon's location. If the rules of the giant battlefield remained the same, she, without a team, would likely be a target.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—And we also need to find the 'Missing Bush'. ​​Now that the 'Missing Bush' has opened, the bush will undoubtedly have appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the key objective of this battlefield is to find the 'Missing Bush'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Just find the bush and you're ready for the scenario. You can survive regardless of clearing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Are you really planning to enter that bush?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Yes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—But the identity of that bush is unknown. It might lead to a strange place. If it's a dangerous place...</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely a risky choice. In fact, even in 'Ways of Survival', it's not described where the 'Missing Bush' leads.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But if my guess is correct...</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thud.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's when I heard a huge footstep from somewhere. I turned my head toward the sound, and there was another thud.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thud.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations of &lt;Emperor&gt;, and even those of &lt;Papyrus&gt;, who had been hunting constellations from afar, stared at it as if entranced.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft muttered in a trembling voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Kim End-ssi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The air on the battlefield trembled with anxiety. Within that trembling, the constellations' greed, anxiety, fear, and joy were simultaneously transmitted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no other way. This vibration wasn't just footsteps.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I knew the identity of this sound. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This is the sound of a star of immense power colliding with its own story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—A myth-grade constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could know instinctively. On the side of the ruined forest, the 'myth-grade constellation' was revealing its status.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Both the fleeing constellations and the constellations that were slaughtering those constellations looked back at the same place at the same time. And like moths attracted to a light, they started moving one by one towards the place where the sound was heard.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The instinct to be part of a great record. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft grabbed my sleeve.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You must not go.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft was right. If it were my usual self, I wouldn't have taken the risk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But now there was a reason I had to go there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—No, I have to go.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't simply because I was curious about the battle between the 'mythical constellations'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although it was very faint, there was a voice of stories that only I could hear.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story, 'Regret, Impoverishment, Obsession', continues its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A familiar story was calling to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft's expression hardened after seeing my expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—No way…</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if we had agreed in advance, we ran towards the forest area at the same time. If someone had spotted us nearby, it would have looked like two very fast rocks rolling by.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I finally reached the area near the forest area, I froze in place. The area was filled with story pressure that made it difficult to breathe. The great constellations that were running like moths screamed.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Immortality forever. The beginning and end of the universe, light following a point in the beginning. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With a scream, the great-grade constellations nearby turned into light. Unable to withstand the pressure of a mythical constellation with all their heart, they were dragged into the vortex of tales.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, standing next to me, was also looking up, out of breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a giant of light shining brightly in the darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A mythical constellation with a beautiful appearance reminiscent of a gigantic archangel.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Mithra, the lord of December 25th. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I knew he was strong. However, once again, I painfully realized that this is the level of a mythical constellation that has revealed their true intentions. I will have to fight against these beings from now on.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Protect the Chairman! The sanctuary will appear soon!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It seems that this forest area is where the sanctuary appears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Seeing that the remnants of the Golden Dice Hall, including Skuld, were seen sparsely, it seemed that Mithra was waiting for the sanctuary with them.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Kaaaaaaaa! Chairman, Chairman—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The scream that follows.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was strange. There was definitely Mithra who had descended there. The great light of myth that no one could defy was protecting the constellations of the 'Golden Dice Hall'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But why? The area of ​​light was gradually shrinking.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 As if the deep darkness was eating away at the light little by little. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did I realize something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thud.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Those footsteps heard earlier were not Mithra's.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thud.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Every time the sound of footsteps echoed, the great constellations in the area disappeared as if vaporizing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is an incredible feat that can burn great-grade constellations to death with just the sound of its footsteps.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Something was staring at me in the darkness of the beginning. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Mythra roared and swung his fist, and the darkness caught it. It wrapped around Mithra's arm and broke Mithra's one remaining wing.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Ooooooooooo—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A terrible scream rang out as if the sky was being torn in half, and Mithra's massive body slowly began to collapse due to the merciless violence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When the master of darkness finally revealed himself in the darkness, I felt like my breath was literally taken away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because he who broke Mithra's wings—I also knew him very well.</p>
