            <div class="orv_title"><h1>781 Episode 36 Real Kim Dokja (2)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">With a special sound, the high-level demon fell.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo retrieved the &#39;Kim Dokja fragment&#39; that the high-level demon had.</p>
[&#39;Kim Dokja fragment&#39; retrieved successfully.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The energy of the story flowing in with the message.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo checked his face reflected in the puddle. The white and pale face that he had once seen on the cover of 『Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint』. It looked a bit younger than what he had seen then. Perhaps it was because his physical age was that of a boy.</p>
「I wonder if I have become a little more Kim Dokja now.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">How many more &#39;Kim Dokja fragments&#39; does he have to collect to become Kim Dokja?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Can he become Kim Dokja?</p>
「&quot;If you are possessed, you must hide behind me. You hate being hurt.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A memory suddenly lingered in his ears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo thought of the owner of the voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Noh Jiyoon.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The daughter of Lee Dansu ahjussi. The girl who visited &#39;Kim Dokja Banquet&#39; with him.</p>
「Jiyoon is dead.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">No one told him that. However, he found out naturally while collecting the &#39;Kim Dokja fragments&#39;.</p>
「Everyone, get out of here! Quickly!」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was a reader who fell at the same station as Jiyoon. Jiyoon fought the monsters to save the reader and the people, and died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#39;t that surprising in this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reader Jiyoon saved that day also died in the end. Torn to pieces by a high-level demon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What was the meaning of Jiyoon&#39;s sacrifice?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo couldn&#39;t quite understand it.</p>
「Just like how he couldn’t understand Kim Dokja, who risked his life for his group, while reading &#39;Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint&#39; over fifty times.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re right. I like being safe.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Replying to his old friend&#39;s voice, Ye Hyunwoo walked around. There was no road, but he walked where he thought it was a road.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He also hummed a song that his friend Jiyoon liked. As he hummed the song, memories that were still vivid enough to be called memories came back to him one after another.</p>
[The story &#39;Panda and Friends&#39; begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The story of persuading Gong Pildu to survive in Chungmuro.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story of developing the &#39;Invincible Castle Tech Tree&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story of almost fighting Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story of &#39;capturing the flag&#39; with the readers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story of meeting Cheon Inho and his group.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But Jiyoon. You liked being safe, too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Disaster scenarios and Peace Land, the Washington Dome and the &#39;Recycling Center&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hiding together in a brick house.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Eating soup made by the crane owner.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fixing a swallow&#39;s leg or taking care of a goose in labor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Watching the group from a corner while eating bamboo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Counting each of those things, Ye Hyunwoo felt that all of those things were like a novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then what role was he assigned in that novel?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo&#39;s steps stopped. The forest ended and a small open space appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a demon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A man wearing a white coat and spreading his black wings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo swallowed as he looked at the red horns sprouting from his head.</p>
[The demon &#39;73rd Demon King&#39; is staring at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;73rd Demon King&#39; slowly turned his back and looked at him.</p>
「Demon King of Salvation.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He had expected it since he heard that the name of the demon was &#39;73rd Demon King&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39; was here. The protagonist they were looking for had appeared as their opponent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the moment their eyes met, Ye Hyunwoo felt strange.</p>
「That&#39;s the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He definitely felt the powerful energy of the &#39;Kim Dokja Fragments&#39; from him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But...</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Come to your senses.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo shook his head several times and took a deep breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;I have to kill him.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since he was marked as the boss of this stage, the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39; must have powers of a different dimension.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He must not let his party face the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;. If he did, there would definitely be casualties. In order to prevent that, he came here before anyone else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment he took a deep breath and stepped into the empty space, shouts were heard from all directions. The forest in the area shook and a group of incarnations appeared.</p>
[Hit him!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations who had drawn their weapons were running towards the Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo immediately recognized who they were. The constellations of the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt;. They were the ones who had participated in the scenario with them until recently.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Monkey that fell from a tree&#39; roars!]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Ox of the Beginning&#39; bares its teeth!]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Red Divine Army&#39; roars!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At first, it seemed like the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; were joining hands to hunt the demon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the wave pattern felt strange. The &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; he knew did not have that level of power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;It&#39;s not the Twelve Zodiac Signs&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A cold sensation passed through his heart belatedly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Someone is using the modifiers of the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if they knew the demon&#39;s weakness, the constellations equipped with divine attribute weapons swung their weapons in precise trajectories. Push shot!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The demon tribe was mercilessly slaughtered by an attack that had the rank of a constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the staggering demon, Ye Hyunwoo&#39;s head went through complicated calculations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It might have been a good thing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39; is a difficult opponent to face alone. If they wait for an opportunity here and join forces with the constellations, the scenario will be much easier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Let&#39;s get started.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">From the start of the scenarios until now, Ye Hyunwoo has steadily progressed through the &#39;Invincible Castle Tech Tree&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Invincible Castle Tech Tree&#39; he designed has a total of 10 stages.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And Ye Hyunwoo has just reached the activation condition for stage 8 of the tech tree.</p>
[Activate exclusive skill &#39;Magic Charge Lv. 10&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The key to this build-up is to apply his exclusive skill, [Magic Charge] — to supply unlimited magical power to Gong Pildu, who has the strongest defense.</p>
「But there is no Gong Pildu here now.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Several constellations that felt the magical wave turned to Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
[That guy—]</p></div>
[Don’t worry. He is an incarnation that can’t do anything alone.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Is his weakness already known to the constellations?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were certainly right. He is an incarnation that can’t do anything alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;But isn’t that the same for everyone?&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo slowly took a deep breath and gathered his magical power. It was finally time for the &#39;Kim Dokja Fragments&#39; he had collected to exert their power.</p>
[The power of the new &#39;Kim Dokja Fragments&#39; is activated.]</p></div>
[Some of the skills of &#39;The Oldest Dream&#39; are restored.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Invincible Castle Tech Tree&#39; he had envisioned required &#39;Gong Pildu&#39; up to stage 7.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, it was different from stage 8.</p>
[Activate exclusive skill &#39;Bookmark Lv.5&#39;!]</p></div>
[The composition of this skill is incomplete.]</p></div>
[The characters that can be listed in the bookmark list are limited.]</p></div>
[Bookmark.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A skill that is exclusive to Kim Dokja and can borrow the power of a &#39;character&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is currently extremely incomplete, so only one &#39;character&#39; can be registered, but that was enough.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the first place, he only needed one character.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will activate bookmark 1, &#39;Armed Fortress Master Gong Pildu&#39;.&quot;</p>
[Bookmark 1 has been activated.]</p></div>
[The activation time is determined in proportion to the level of the bookmark skill.]</p></div>
[Your understanding of the character is very high.]</p></div>
[The activation time of the bookmark skill is partially adjusted according to your exclusive characteristics.]</p></div>
[Activation time: 20 minutes]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The character that had been protecting him was now inside him.</p>
[Activate exclusive skill &#39;Private Land Lv.10&#39;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu&#39;s private land occupied the area in an instant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, this alone was not enough to activate the &#39;Armed Fortress&#39;. This was because Gong Pildu&#39;s &#39;Armed Fortress&#39; was not an exclusive skill, but a &#39;stigma&#39;.</p>
[Bookmark cannot borrow the &#39;stigma&#39; of the person in question.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, Ye Hyunwoo had a countermeasure for that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will fulfill the contract with the Defense Master.&quot;</p>
[The constellation &#39;Defense Master&#39; activates the contract.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A contract made with the &#39;Defense Master&#39; in preparation for an emergency.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The contract was simple.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In exchange for granting the Defense Master&#39;s request, he would receive one of Gong Pildu&#39;s &#39;Stigmata&#39; at a &#39;desired moment&#39;.</p>
[You have acquired the temporary use of &#39;Armed Fortress&#39;.]</p></div>
[The corresponding stigma will be converted to an &#39;Exclusive Skill&#39; for the corresponding scenario.]</p></div>
[Exclusive Skill &#39;Armed Fortress Lv. 8&#39; has been activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The ground beneath his feet rose and Ye Hyunwoo&#39;s body rose into the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The outer wall of the &#39;Armed Fortress&#39; that would protect him from any attack was growing.</p>
[What, what is this—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A small castle that grew more than twenty meters in an instant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It looked rather crude compared to the &#39;Armed Fortress&#39; of Tech Tree Stage 10 that he was aiming for, but this was enough for now.</p>
[The &#39;Moving Fortress&#39; is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The fortress began to move along with the wheels that grew under the fortress.</p>
[The &#39;Turret&#39; of the Armed Fortress is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As the magnificent magic turrets aimed forward at once, the constellations that felt a sense of crisis shouted.</p>
[Didn&#39;t you say that guy can&#39;t do anything alone?]</p></div>
[Damn it, finish him off quickly! If that guy steals the effective hit—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo sat on the castle&#39;s control tower while listening to the constellations&#39; screams.</p>
[Activate the power of the item &#39;Shin Gijeon&#39;.]</p></div>
[The &#39;turret&#39;s&#39; arc destructive power increases!]</p></div>
[The &#39;turret&#39;s&#39; shells have a tracking function added.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The castle&#39;s radar activated and the dusty &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39; appeared in the field of view.</p>
[Set the target of the strike.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39; had already suffered massive damage to its incarnation body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo, who had finally made up his mind, pressed the fire button.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 64 turrets opened fire, and a loud noise rang out as if they were sweeping away the forest. The dust rose pitch black.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the scream heard within was not that of the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;.</p>
[Kuaaaaaaaah!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations of the constellations burst into pieces in the dust.</p>
[The constellation &#39;monkey that fell from the tree&#39; takes a huge blow and exits the scenario.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;rabbit without a liver&#39; takes a huge blow and exits the scenario.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even some of the constellations could not withstand the blow and exited the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, Ye Hyunwoo did not stop.</p>
[You, why—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The indignant constellations aimed their weapons at him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the constellations running towards him, Ye Hyunwoo thought.</p>
「Why did I do that?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was an unwise choice. Naturally, joining forces with those constellations to end the demon and share the story would have been the safe choice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the moment he saw the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39; caught on the radar, Ye Hyunwoo could not make a safe choice.</p>
「It definitely wasn&#39;t the Demon King of Salvation that he imagined.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The face of the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39; who had become a demon was as pale as a corpse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A body like rags made of flesh. Eyes that had lost their light and skin that felt lifeless.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, this scenario had to end by hunting him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s the only way to save the party.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He came here before anyone else for that goal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, the moment he saw Kim Dokja&#39;s face, Ye Hyunwoo felt faintly dizzy.</p>
「I don&#39;t know if the author will see it. But I&#39;ll try it anyway. There&#39;s a spell I sometimes recite when I&#39;m having a hard time.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The enraged constellations abandoned the demon and began to run toward the castle.</p>
「I am Kim Dokja.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo knew it too. He is not Kim Dokja. He knew better than anyone that he was not Kim Dokja, so he recited that spell.</p>
「But according to my friend, I resemble an octopus more than a squid.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo pressed the fire button again and again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Piles of dirt scattered everywhere. The constellations screamed in frustration amidst the broken pieces of wood.</p>
[Kwaaaaah! Damn it!]</p></div>
[Hold on! Wait until the bastard’s magic runs out! How long can he keep up this barrage—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With the effect of [Magic Charge], magic power filled Ye Hyunwoo’s entire body once again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The core of the Invincible Castle’s tech tree—the 「Infinite Uroboros」system—was manifested.</p>
[Eww!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations that had been holding on firmly began to fall one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo’s inner self also gradually grew more certain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were at most the incarnation bodies of &#39;great-grade constellations&#39;. Even if the synchronization rate was increased in this &#39;Recycling Center&#39; with limited rank, they would not be able to withstand the fortress&#39; concentrated bombardment.</p>
[Warning! The durability of the &#39;Armed Fortress&#39; is decreasing!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A thud was heard, along with the sound of something collapsing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Startled, Ye Hyunwoo checked the radar. However, nothing was detected. Someone was attacking the fortress at a speed that could not be detected by the detection system.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kugugugu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The current &#39;Armed Fortress&#39; was now only a level 5 fortress.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As powerful strikes continued, the outer wall of the fortress collapsed and cracks began to form on the inner wall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Ye Hyunwoo, who had lost some energy, recharged his magic power once again and activated the turret, something appeared, breaking through the control tower&#39;s defense wall.</p>
[I didn&#39;t know that &#39;Armed Fortress&#39; would be used like this. It&#39;s quite something.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Three incarnations appeared. They were all guys he had never seen before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnation body of the constellation at the forefront approached Ye Hyunwoo like a ghost and grabbed him by the neck.</p>
[Why did you interfere with us?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo laughed, hanging in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even now, Ye Hyunwoo does not understand Kim Dokja, who sacrificed himself for the group.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, even though he did not understand him, Ye Hyunwoo liked him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellation, who was quietly looking at Ye Hyunwoo hanging in the air, spoke.</p>
[What you did just now wasn&#39;t courage, it was just foolishness.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment he heard that voice, Ye Hyunwoo felt goosebumps running down his spine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He realized something new.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Invincible Castle Tech Tree Stage 8&#39; was designed to withstand attacks from &#39;great-grade constellations&#39; inside the &#39;Recycling Center&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But if they had broken through this wall and entered, it was clear what kind of enemy they were.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Narrative-grade constellation&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ominous sparks that surged through the air proved it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He couldn&#39;t understand it. How did a narrative-grade constellation intervene in the scenario of this &#39;Recycling Center&#39;?</p>
[The worldview is unstable due to the aftermath of excessive probability.]</p></div>
[Many constellations are watching the &#39;Recycling Center&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He could feel the gaze of the stars watching this place from the vast distance of space.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How many constellations are watching this place?</p>
[The worldview rules of the &#39;Recycling Center&#39; are weakened.]</p></div>
[The probability of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; starts to move!]</p></div>
[An unidentified nebula interferes with the probability of the &#39;Recycling Center&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Olympus? Asgard? Vedas?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Or a small nebula that was hidden?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment he saw the aftershock of probability that brightly colored the empty space, Ye Hyunwoo intuitively felt that this scenario had completely left his hands.</p>
[You also have a fragment of the oldest dream.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Bam-&quot;</p>
[This is really strange. Why do all the incarnations with this fragment invite death…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Feeling a hand tightly squeezing his neck, Ye Hyunwoo intuitively sensed his end.</p>
「&quot;Kim Dokja, I will become him.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Considering his boastful words, he felt that it was a vain end. At the same time, he also thought that this was a very fitting end for him. Perhaps, ever since he first saw Cheon Inho in Chungmuro, he had a feeling this day would come.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He couldn’t become Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was someone in this world who was much more suited to Kim Dokja’s place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His role was to play the role of an extra in the lines that no one would remember.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, if there was one last regret, it was this.</p>
「I really wanted to say thank you. I’ll come back to see you again in a few days.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That he couldn’t keep the promise he left in that comment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the powerful magic flowed through the constellation’s hand, his consciousness began to fade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he died like this and became a fragment of Kim Dokja, would he be able to meet Jiyoon again? Would he be able to laugh and talk about this story when they met again?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Look, if you really possess someone in &#39;Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint&#39;, you&#39;ll die right away. Saying that—</p>
<p class="orv_line">Would he be able to not regret reading this story?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo waited for death with such thoughts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, no matter how much time passed, his consciousness did not disappear. He felt his body floating in the air, and someone was holding him and putting him down on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He slowly opened his eyes and raised his head, and saw someone&#39;s back.</p>
[The &lt;Star Stream&gt; intervenes in the probability aftermath of the area.]</p></div>
[The probability scale moves.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Is it Kim Dokja?</p>
<p class="orv_line">But when he looked again, he was wearing a black cloak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So is it Yoo Jonghyuk?</p>
<p class="orv_line">No. He was smaller than Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo noticed the words written on his back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">『OLD SCHOOL』.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Old School.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy wearing the cloak looked back at him. The moment he met those eyes that felt strangely stubborn, Ye Hyunwoo thought he knew who he was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s because he had read this story fifty times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You... look like my Dokja-hyung.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A being who could move the &#39;probability scale&#39; against those scary constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thank you for saving my hyung.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; came to the &#39;Recycling Center&#39;.</p>
