<p class="orv_line">Will they really be able to meet Kim Dokja again at the end of this road? Is that poor guy really alive with them?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Sometimes you need to rest.]</div>[Sometimes you need to rest.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk thought about the stars that didn&#x27;t talk to him. He reminisced about his lost sponsor and imagined another self who had reached his ◼️◼️ — &#x27;Secretive Plotter&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will a moment like that of &#x27;Secretive Plotter&#x27; come to him?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will there be some kind of salvation at the end of this difficult life?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk could hardly imagine. His ◼️◼️ was as distant as Kim Dokja&#x27;s now blurred face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will he know when this trip is over?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why was he born, lived, and continues to live in this world?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Captain, have you ever thought about that?]</div>[Captain, have you ever thought about that?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk answered Biyoo&#x27;s question half a beat late.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I think there might be a happy universe in which all these tragedies did not occur.]</div>[I think there might be a happy universe in which all these tragedies did not occur.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Happy universe, Yoo Jonghyuk thought about that strange word for a moment and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If it weren’t for all those tragedies, we wouldn’t be where we are today.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Biyoo pursed her lips as if she hadn&#x27;t asked that and then added.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[But sometimes you can imagine a different world.]</div>[But sometimes you can imagine a different world.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What world are you talking about?&quot;</p>

<p class="orv_line">&quot;...&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The biggest tragedy in that world is oversleeping and being late for school.]</div>[The biggest tragedy in that world is oversleeping and being late for school.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk silently listened to Biyoo.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Plus, the lunch menu that day is a tasteless meal. I went to a PC room with the money I spent on supplies and got caught by my parents.]</div>[Plus, the lunch menu that day is a tasteless meal. I went to a PC room with the money I spent on supplies and got caught by my parents.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk briefly imagined the world described by Biyoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, such a world was not depicted very well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because he never went to school properly, never ate lunch without worrying about the taste, and his parents never existed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You are the Dokkaebi King now. Why do you miss those things?&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Why? Can’t I miss it?]</div>[Why? Can’t I miss it?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hearing that question, Yoo Jonghyuk looked back on his old memories. A face suddenly came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A girl who often smiled brightly. A child who always called him &#x27;captain&#x27; and followed him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“You were Shin Yoosoung of the 41st round.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Well, if you look at the origin, yes.]</div>[Well, if you look at the origin, yes.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you still blaming me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk remembered Shin Yoosoung, the &#x27;Disaster of Floods&#x27;. She came to the past to change the future, but Shin Yoosoung was disappointed in him. Shin Yoosoung tried to kill him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He will never forget the look in her eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[No. I can’t even remember those times very well.]</div>[No. I can’t even remember those times very well.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The girl who was reincarnated as a dokkaebi, burying all resentment and hatred, spoke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Yoo Jonghyuk watched such a Biyoo, he felt an unknown emotion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So where does Shin Yoosoung&#x27;s 41st round go now? What will now fill the space where all hatred and resentment have disappeared?</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if understanding Yoo Jonghyuk’s doubts, Biyoo spoke.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[It’s not that bad to have gaps in your memory. Because that blank space can be filled with other imagination.]</div>[It’s not that bad to have gaps in your memory. Because that blank space can be filled with other imagination.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;In the 41st round, I did something I couldn’t take back.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[It may have been so. But there weren&#x27;t only bad things in that round.]</div>[It may have been so. But there weren't only bad things in that round.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Biyoo muttered as if retracing the traces of the disappeared 41st round.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[So, try to imagine as much fun as possible. In fact, there must have been a very cool adventure in the 41st round. It&#x27;s just that the captain, I, and everyone else forgot.]</div>[So, try to imagine as much fun as possible. In fact, there must have been a very cool adventure in the 41st round. It's just that the captain, I, and everyone else forgot.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;…&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Do you know? I may have been in school in that round. The captain could have come to my graduation ceremony.]</div>[Do you know? I may have been in school in that round. The captain could have come to my graduation ceremony.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, such a thing could not have been possible, but Biyoo continued.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Maybe there was a Dokja in that round as well.]</div>[Maybe there was a Dokja in that round as well.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s impossible.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I&#x27;m just imagining it. Because it’s fun to imagine.]</div>[I'm just imagining it. Because it’s fun to imagine.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk thought about himself in the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He doesn&#x27;t know how he felt or what he felt during the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did he send Shin Yoosoung to the past? What kind of tragedy did he face that made him think that was the only solution?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[It gets serious again. They say have fun imagining things! Don’t you think so?]</div>[It gets serious again. They say have fun imagining things! Don’t you think so?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk looked out into the street in silence. The sun set late in the day. Students were seen leaving school as the sunset broke over Silgaecheon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I won’t.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Don’t you think the captain will have a dream life too?]</div>[Don’t you think the captain will have a dream life too?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s the life he dreamed of. If there was such a thing, his life should have been different when the scenario ended.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Well, if there was such a thing, the captain wouldn&#x27;t have been unemployed. The captain is also really pitiful.]</div>[Well, if there was such a thing, the captain wouldn't have been unemployed. The captain is also really pitiful.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I am neither pitiful nor unemployed.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[That&#x27;s right. Imagination does that.]</div>[That's right. Imagination does that.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s not my imagination. I’ve always trained with the sword.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[What were you planning on doing with your sword training?]</div>[What were you planning on doing with your sword training?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">What were you trying to do by training your sword? Yoo Jonghyuk had nothing to say in response.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no longer a constellation in the sky that he had seen. There was no one who would acknowledge him for training with the sword.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Did you try to become a kendo player like Heewon-ssi?]</div>[Did you try to become a kendo player like Heewon-ssi?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t plan on doing that.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Then you are just an unemployed person who is good at using a sword.]</div>[Then you are just an unemployed person who is good at using a sword.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did he train with the sword?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment when Yoo Jonghyuk, who had been contemplating for a long time, was barely able to come up with an answer. .</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The voices of boys and girls were heard from below Silgaecheon. One girl said, &quot;Let’s go to the PC room!&quot; She shouted, and the other boy frowned. Then the slim, white boy put a headlock on the frowning boy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah! Let’s go!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment he heard the boy&#x27;s voice, Yoo Jonghyuk jumped up from his seat.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Captain?]</div>[Captain?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk started going down the hill. The legs that had been moving slowly became faster and faster. Yoo Jonghyuk ran to the boy, forgetting that he was out of breath, and grabbed him by the shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy frowned and looked back at him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What is it, ahjussi?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blunt-looking boy grabbed Yoo Jonghyuk&#x27;s arm, and as if protecting the boy, the girl frowned menacingly at Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk quickly let go of his hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m sorry. I saw wrong.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The boy and girl grumbled slightly and set out on the road again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at their somewhat unfamiliar yet familiar backs, Yoo Jonghyuk suddenly imagined something like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe that boy.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Biyoo says, isn&#x27;t that boy also Kim Dokja, who was reborn after forgetting all his tragedies at the end of his reincarnation?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk looked at the boy and girl next to him. A blunt boy with a strangely similar vibe to him, and a girl with tear spots like Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, those children were neither Yoo Jonghyuk nor Han Sooyoung. Even though he knew this, Yoo Jonghyuk continued to feel strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What if there really is a story like that somewhere in this universe?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Biyoo’s voice laughing softly tickled his ears.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Look at that. Even the captain has a story he imagines.]</div>[Look at that. Even the captain has a story he imagines.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk slowly opened his eyes and woke up from the turbulent storm of his memories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Pure white steam rose from his whole body as he sat cross-legged. The wounds from the fierce battle with Odin had turned black.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;I overdid it.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk recalled the last fierce battle. Receiving Odin&#x27;s spear, cutting down the legendary constellations of &lt;Asgard&gt;, crashing the incarnation into the void curtain, and being swept away by the aftereffects of probability.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If &#x27;Monarch Slayer&#x27; Jaehwan had not helped him, he would  have been swept away by the torrent of probability and would not have been able to return.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Monarch Slayer.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk thought about Jaehwan. The miracle of rebirth was not felt anywhere in the vicinity. He&#x27;s a guy who can&#x27;t catch the original species, so he might be traveling all over the Star Stream again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;You wasted too much probability. It wasn&#x27;t a probability  to be used here.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Originally, he planned to save this probability and save it again and then explode it at an important time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Kim Dokja&#x27;s presence had not been felt in &#x27;Washington Dome&#x27;, he would not have made such a risky choice.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Kim Dokja.」</div>「Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Yoo Jonghyuk thought of that name, he suddenly felt a familiar feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A feeling that someone is watching him. Yoo Jonghyuk knew what this feeling was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A unique skill possessed by that guy who only talks about it, that magically appeared whenever and wherever he thought about it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk reflexively looked up into space.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Yoo Jonghyuk looked at me, I was shocked and changed the screen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wow, I’m surprised.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was really that &#x27;Yoo Jonghyuk&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I couldn&#x27;t understand how this was possible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, if I were to explain it somehow, the situation I was in now was as follows.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I am the ‘world line’ from [Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint]. I crossed the wall.」</div>「I am the ‘world line’ from [Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint]. I crossed the wall.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">A voice from another world line reached my ears, and I followed that voice, crossed the wall of the world line, and came to this place—that is, to the place where &#x27;Yoo Jonghyuk of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;&#x27; is.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on, but just knowing that this happened in reality made my heart race.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What if I could observe other &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; members like I observed Yoo Jonghyuk?</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, beyond observation—</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Dokja ahjussi.&quot;」</div>「"Dokja ahjussi."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">If only I could tell them my &#x27;story&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Dokja ahjussi.&quot;」</div>「"Dokja ahjussi."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I follow this voice, will I be able to meet the others?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I concentrated once again. Then, my field of vision slowly cleared and a new landscape was revealed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Somehow, familiar voices were heard in the hazy atmosphere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Noona, why isn’t this showing anything?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hmm. Biyoo said it could definitely be seen this way.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Isn’t the Other Worlds Device broken?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey! Lee Gilyoung! Don’t kick that!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The sooty bastard did this before and it was okay.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Master, really. Unnie, where is the broadcast area for this?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It was the Gourmet Association.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Shall I come and beat up the Gourmet Association kids?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah, it’s coming out! The screen is coming out!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">And after a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ahjussi! It’s him!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He really looks just like Dokja ahjussi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But the situation doesn’t look good…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, why is that guy passed out over there? Doesn’t someone really have to go help?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;External constellations cannot intervene in the Recycling Center.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But we can’t just leave him like that!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly opened my eyes. I saw familiar faces huddled together in front of a small display.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I unconsciously reach out to them...</p>
<p class="orv_line">…I have hands?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt sensations all over my body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How on earth did this happen?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I moved my neck, which was not working well, and checked my hands and feet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hands and feet that are unbelievably smaller      than mine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then a woman with beautiful brown hair turned to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In person, the face resembles Ji Eunyu even more.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Little Dokja, are you awake?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was suddenly lifted into the air, fully understanding the feelings of Meihouwang, who was held in Ji Eunyu&#x27;s arms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I want to hug him too!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You’re awake?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Two children running. Looking at that scenery, I felt an unknown emotion overflowing with me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Shall we watch it together?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The screen my companions were watching came into view along with a friendly voice. On the screen, there is a fainted figure and Ji Eunyu driving a carriage as well as Cha Yerin .</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Yerin-ssi. Do you know how to drive?&quot;」</div>「"Yerin-ssi. Do you know how to drive?"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;I am a minor.&quot;」</div>「"I am a minor."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a landscape that had no sense of reality, it was only then that I realized what had happened to me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;Heir to the Eternal Name&#x27; reacts.]</div>[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' reacts.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;Heir to the Eternal Name&#x27; is taking a liking to the &#x27;Kim Dokja Fragment&#x27; that you possessed.]</div>[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' is taking a liking to the 'Kim Dokja Fragment' that you possessed.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Small hands, small feet. A small body that is difficult to get up on its own.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely true.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill &#x27;Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint Level 3&#x27; is in effect.]</div>[Exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint Level 3' is in effect.]</p>
