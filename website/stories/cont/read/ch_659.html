<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't plan to use [Incite] from the beginning.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If ahjussi’s reason still remained, I intended to use [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] to stop him somehow.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I won't kill you! I won't kill you!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi, who could be seen from afar, repeated the same words as if screaming.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Even though I knew it wouldn't work, I shouted again.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi! Calm down!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I managed to find the location of Dansu ahjussi using [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint], but that was it.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">My [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] could see the world through that person's eyes and read their memories, but I couldn't empathize with that person.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Is it because my understanding of him is not enough? 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A man who has lived his entire life for his daughter.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A man who lost his wife and fell ill himself.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Now I understand why the man was wearing a hospital gown at the last 'banquet'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps that was the last appearance of Dansu ahjussi before he was possessed.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Dansu ahjussi! I'm Cheon Inho."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I had to stop Dansu ahjussi somehow. However, ahjussi had already absorbed the five star jewels and was in the 5th stage of madness.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Aaaaaang!</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The labyrinth vibrated violently. Killer King, who was watching the situation from the side, said a word.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What great physical abilities. If you get close, you'll be crushed to the bone."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations brushed by ahjussi’s fist swung and splattered blood.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you going to do it anyway?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I have to."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">However, the road to ahjussi did not seem easy.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The reason was that the provocative fire flute I used attracted not only Dansu ahjussi but also others.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The wild beasts from all over the labyrinth are aiming for ahjussi.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Most of them were the embodiment of the Misreading association.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's the Misreading association."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Not all members of the union are from the 'Misreading association'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Kill the Misreading association."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I was about to ask if there was even a radar in the back, but something like a small hal protruded from Killer King's arm. A bow gun with a black sheen.</p>
<br>

<p class="orv_line">Even looking at it, it was an S-class item.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Shush shush.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Every time an arrow is fired, an incarnation is knocked down as it runs out in the passageway.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Given the high level of fire rate and accuracy, [Improved fire rate] and [Improved aiming power] were used.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">There was no doubt that it was an item with this dwelling place.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations who were hit by the arrows that flew in rapid succession groaned and screamed.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"The second apostle."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The name of Killer King was called everywhere, as if he had already become a celebrity there.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A small number of constellations pay attention to 'Incarnation Kang Ilhun'.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Who would have known that extra Kang Ilhun would become this strong?</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it's because he's attracted the attention of the constellations, but his expression is strangely excited.</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll tell you the little ones."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Catch the second apostle first."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As if they thought the Killer King's existence was threatening, the incarnations of the Alliance started running toward it all at once.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King did not panic and invoked the holy spirit.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A red mist rolls over his whole body.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately recognized what the Holy Spirit was.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Great Warrior Jophiel's '503 Unit'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">When Killer King drew the bowstring, the roasted mist wrapped around the tip of the arrow as if it were alive.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Everybody, die."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The arrow flew like a shot and caused a dust explosion when it hit the target.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The elites of the '503 Corps', who bounced in all directions like a grenade burst, pierced five or six incarnations nearby at breakneck speed and turned them into beehives.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Uh. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Frightened, several of members of the union fell.</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I hate to admit it, but it was a great sight.</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The way he speaks is like Kim Namwoon, but his skills are astonishing even to Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King nodded his head with an inexplicable smile, as if he had read my eyes.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Go. Kim Dokja."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m not."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I believe."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know what you're talking about, but it seemed like this was the only chance.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As I ran to the floor, Literature Girl 64 followed my steps.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's a game my brother often plays."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I know roughly."</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Just like Yoo Jonghyuk and Kim Dokja formed a duo in the main story, let's fight together.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Then what is Yerin’s role?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It changes every time."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Literature Girl 64 added while blowing away one of the incarnations that rushed at her with her elegant feet.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Isn’t it Han Sooyoung now?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja, Yoo Jonghyuk, and Han Sooyoung.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">At my words, Literature Girl 64 nodded her head.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">An incarnation of powerful energy could be seen right in front of Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The brightly shining Dustman was definitely different from those of other incarnations.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's the king."</p>

<p class="orv_line">"I will take care of it."</p>

<br>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Get out of the way everyone!"</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I have to stop it somehow.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">However, the passage was once again blocked by the members of the union that came from the side passage.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King's support shots, which flew in from time to time, were also gradually delayed.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was because of the appearance of long-distance power over there.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Shoot!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Troops of arrows holding each bow were lined up on the other side of the aisle.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I reflexively swung my sword while supplying magic power to the broken faith.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Blade of Faith' is activated!]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I barely managed to remove the single arrows, but the destructive power of each arrow was heavy.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed that there was an incarnation with specialized archery skills.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Can I break through?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't impossible if [Incite] was used.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Like when dealing with the ark of the Beggar Sect, if I borrow the power of Kyrgios, I can break through the arrows and reach Dansu ahjussi’s nose at once.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was then.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">When I have already exhausted my strength with [Strengthen Sentence], will I still have the energy to stop Dansu ahjussi?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that I got a message from the group chat in my ear.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—Ahjussi, get down.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I reflexively grabbed Literature Girl 64 by the shoulder and made her get down.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Looking back, I saw Shin Yoosoung touching the ground with her palm. At the same time, portals swayed in the maze.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Monster Gate.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I was surprised.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Was Shin Yoosoung able to open the gate at this point?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Beyond the gate, dozens of Nagaks, who had been tamed by Shin Yoosoung, were creeping over.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What, what! Where did you appear from?!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations shot arrows toward the monsters in the air.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Not to be outdone by them, the Nagaks with their mouths wide open began to sing in chorus.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Nagak Ensemble.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Even that mighty strong king got thrown in the air and stuck in a stupid place by the bombardment of the pouring sonic waves.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">While the surprised incarnations wandered around, Shin Yoosoung's voice was heard.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—Go, ahjussi.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Light sparks flew from the body of Shin Yoosoung, who was manipulating the Nagaks.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—You said he was close to you.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung's golden eyes flickered. The eyes of a child who is looking at me but not looking at me at the same time.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—You must never die.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I ran while infusing [Broken Faith] with the [White and Blue River]. Cutting off the limbs of the incarnations with the new soldier's blade, I ran towards ahjussi.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Okay, throw it! Feed him another one!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">But they were faster than me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The star jewel that flew through the air reached the dust man of Dansu ahjussi. With a whimpering sound, ahjussi’s whole body began to flatten once again.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Now, just by going near Dansu ahjussi, I felt creepy.</p>

<p class="orv_line">The face of the old man with black bloody tears was fixed on me.</p>

<p class="orv_line">The man who can't see anything.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Pass the star jewel to me."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In this Star Labyrinth, there are a total of two ways to steal someone else's Bell Powder.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">One is to become the same group and unify 'Dustman'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The second is to kill others to get star dust from the dust surface.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">But as I guessed, those two methods are not the only ones.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If that were all, other 'kings' would not be able to throw star jewels at Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">My guess is this.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If [Dust] is made into a 'Star Jewel', the 'Star Jewel' will become tradeable!</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Burrr.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The dust side of Dansu ahjussi in the air is painful.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">He shuddered as if he was embarrassed, and soon he made a profit with a wok.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A piece of shiny five-colored stone.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was a star jewel.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi handed me a star jewel like someone would give his daughter his birthday present.</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The operation was successful.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations of the Union, who had been paying attention to the surroundings, were agitated.</p>

<p class="orv_line">"It's okay. Leave it alone."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's like he’s indulging in his own greed."</p>
<br>

<p class="orv_line">Also, I knew that.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Due to the 'Madness Penalty', no one can collect '7 Star Jewels' while remaining sane in this labyrinth.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">So, it would be their plan to collect 7 star jewels for the sacrificial lamb and take only the summoned death sword.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Ha ha ha! Eat a lot!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The ruse was noticed early on.</p>

<p class="orv_line">I also have equipment with strong anti-magic abilities, and most of all, I have [Incite].</p>

<p class="orv_line">So I was confident.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Now, Dansu ahjussi's overall ability was much weaker than before. I released 'Noh Jiyoon''s [Incite] and showed my final concentration.</p>
