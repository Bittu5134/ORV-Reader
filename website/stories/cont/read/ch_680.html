<p class="orv_line">Hello everyone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is Lee Hakhyun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the meantime, things haveescalated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">You've probably all forgotten my name. Of course. It's not a very cool name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you're the main character, I guess you would be named Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shouldn’t it be a name like that? Suddenly, it’s Lee Hakhyun. </p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, it feels like a person from the real world has suddenly possessed someone in a web novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But as you all know, I am truly possessing a character in a web novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wasn't even just possessing someone, it was a shabby villain—</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">You're right. That name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is the name of the villain I possessed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I haven’t woken up for quite some time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—They said it was a miracle that I was alive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know who you are, but you are telling me what I want to say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's my life after possessing Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Being alive is a miracle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even at Geumho Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in Chungmuro.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in the theater dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even at Seoul Station and Gwanghwamun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I really almost died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know what's going on these days, perhaps because I've been at risk of dying so many times that I've lost my mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In particular, I don't know who I am.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It sounds like something a second year middle schooler would worry about, but I'm serious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it because I used [Incite] too much? Or is it because I didn't think enough about my own identity in my second year of middle school?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Either that or—</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【How long are you going to talk like that?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Oh, that's right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">You can't take such a half-hearted attitude anymore.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Please forget all the self-introductions I’ve made so far.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We'll do it right again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hello everyone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My name is Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's really awkward to say this, but I'm serious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I am the reincarnation of 49% Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, everyone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I'm a little scared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Everyone, think about it too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One day, I suddenly possessed a character in a novel, and it became 'the reincarnation of the main character in my novel turns out to be me'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Does such a light novel-like development make sense?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Ji Eunyu, the editor in charge, heard about it, she would make fun of it forever.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu would definitely say this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wow, author! Readers made fun of Kim Dokja, saying he was the author’s own character, but it wasn’t his character, it was him. Wow, wow."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I feel really unfair.</p>
<p class="orv_line">First, let me make one thing clear: I didn't actually write that novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The writer who wrote that story is Han Sooyoung...</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung?</p>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<p class="orv_line">I jumped up from my seat with a hysterical scream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart was pounding like crazy and my breath was pouring out all the way to my chin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone's shadow glimmered through my hazy vision.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sensation slowly returned from my fingertips. The feel of the soft bed and blanket. A hospital-specific disinfectant smell.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My mind was confused.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What happened?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What about Han Sooyoung?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What about the Outer God?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What about Yoo Junghyuk?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did we succeed?</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I opened my eyes with difficulty and looked ahead, I saw the shape of a familiar person.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kind eyes shining beneath the devoted eyebrows.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansu who no longer called me a friend hugged me tightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why? The moment I was hugged helplessly by Lee Dansu, without realizing it, my body lost strength and tears poured out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank goodness. I’m so glad."</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were so many tears that it was surprising that even a villain had so many tears stored up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I listened to the man repeatedly saying that it was fortunate, I thought again that this was a fortunate thing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's how I survived again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time, I sacrificed someone on my behalf.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">There were people who were the first to run when they heard my news.</p>
<p class="orv_line">These were people I knew well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It feels like it's been a while, so I'd like to briefly introduce them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aaaah! Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The name of the girl running towards me over there is Kyung Sein.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although she appears to be a woman on the outside, she is actually a reader with the soul of a man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You’re awake, Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man in the black coat standing proudly in the doorway of the hospital room is the second apostle, 'Killer King'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though he looks like that on the outside, he is a crazy person who has read 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' over a hundred times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He has a habit of constantly calling me 'Kim Dokja', but I don’t know if he does it knowingly or not.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For reference, he has a younger sister who uses the ID 'Literature Girl 64'. Yerin is a very normal person, unlike her older brother, Killer King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi, how do you feel right now? Do you see these fingers and a dog? Can you tell me your name? How old are you? What is your real name in real life?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The name of the boy who took advantage of my confused state of mind to get information from me is 'Ye Hyunwoo'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This boy, who looks just like today's gifted child from a gifted education program, is the commander of the Chungmuro Group and the brain that leads the readers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. I’m fine."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You still have a bit of a fever, so I think it would be better to rest more."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lastly, the name of this handsome man who took my temperature is 'Lee Dansu'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is the first reader I have ever met, and he is a man living in this world trying to get his daughter back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The rest of the party... hasn't arrived yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tried to name them one by one in my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, Cha Yerin, Ji Eunyu, Koo Seonah...</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Amidst a light silence. It was Lee Dansu who opened his mouth again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why? The eyes of people looking at me were different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed like he was trying to figure out what to ask, or he seemed to be having trouble deciding what to say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled lightly and opened my mouth first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Can I ask what happened so far?"</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I was unconscious for 45 days?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">While listening to Kyung Sein's fussing voice, I could think in my head how long 45 days.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, wait a minute.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So what scenario is this now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The seventh scenario is currently underway on the Korean Peninsula."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't believe my ears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Not the fifth?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey, when did the fifth scenario end?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The last scenario I remember was the fourth scenario, 'the King’s Qualifications'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait a minute."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I rested my head for a moment and thought about the development of 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fifth scenario in the original Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint was 'Disaster of Floods'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Disaster of Floods' is a scenario that ends only after defeating as many as four disasters, even excluding the main Disaster of Floods.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I killed one at the National Palace Museum, have they already killed the remaining four? </p>
<p class="orv_line">"The fifth scenario was solved by Yoo Jung-hyuk himself. And the main character was the main character."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How did he clear it? Could it be that he killed Shin Yoosoung—?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Have you forgotten that this is the 41st round?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A vivid feeling rose up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is the 41st round of 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was also the world line before 'Shin Yoosoung' returned to the second round to become the 'Disaster of Floods'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, there is no 'Disaster of Floods' yet in this round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the disaster was not only the Disaster of Floods.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The Disaster of questions was quite formidable. However, I easily defeated it with the help of this body."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The 2nd Apostle was not active, and Yoo Jonghyuk killed him."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I roughly understand the situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know what kind of disaster occurred, but in any case, it seems that Yoo Jonghyuk in the 41st round suppressed it with terrifying force.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Speaking of the fifth... What happened to the sixth scenario? That must have been tricky too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sixth scenario is 'Peace Land' with Japanese incarnations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In some ways, it was a scenario that could be more difficult than the 'Disaster of Floods'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Jonghyuk went and finished it himself."</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Yoo Jung-hyuk?”</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked in a doubtful voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not like any other scenario, 'Peace Land' is a scenario where Disasters and Inhabitants take sides and fight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Could it be that Yoo Jonghyuk became a disaster?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked, assuming the worst outcome first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If in the 41st round, 'Yoo Jonghyuk' had chosen the side of disasters, 'Peace Land' would have been—</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don’t worry. Yoo Jonghyuk took the inhabitants’ side."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk? really?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We arrived faster than expected and the damage was greatly reduced. We cooperated well with the Japanese incarnations. Asuka Ren and Izumi are both safe! Isn’t that surprising?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asuka Ren and Izumi, the king of Japan, are safe..</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you just listen to the story, the situation wasn't that bad.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What about Kyrgios?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn’t meet Kyrgios. I guess the events in this round were divided."</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, if one thing goes well, the other thing goes wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My original plan was to meet Kyrgios Roadgrim in Peace Land and train to become a Transcendant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I was passed out, and Kyrgios didn't even visit 'Peace Land'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The seventh scenario is still in progress. Actually, Yerin and Heewon are in the scenario area because of that. Oh, and Jiwon too…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it because the words I heard earlier were so shocking? It was difficult to concentrate and listen to what was being said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">During the 45 days I slept, the world of the 41st round was thrown out of the orbit of the 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But if you ask me if it was bad, it wasn't all that bad.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Disaster Scenario' and 'Peace Land' are scenarios that are difficult to clear smoothly even if I participated in person.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Yoo Jonghyuk cleared both scenarios perfectly on his own without any help.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this a development that also occurred in the original 41st round?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Or, is this a phenomenon that occurred because Han Sooyoung and I killed the founder of the Absolute Throne?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein added, perhaps because my expression seemed serious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Anyway, don’t worry. The 41st round wasn’t as bad as I thought. As expected, the 'Absolute Throne’s' effect is good."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Absolute throne?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein nodded at me as I asked in a stupid voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. Absolute throne."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you still have it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh? Well… It didn’t break in this round."</p>
<p class="orv_line">That couldn't have been possible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Clearly, the 'founder of the absolute throne' is dead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw it clearly with my own eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who is the king? Is he among you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">At my question, my companions turned to each other.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein smiled bitterly, and Lee Dansu shook his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King looked proud, and Ye Hyunwoo burst into laughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That can’t be possible, Inho-ssi. How can we become kings? The real king is alive and well."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly got up from the bed. Perhaps because I had not moved my muscles for the first time in a while, my legs were shaking precariously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stood up unsteadily and saw the window of the hospital room beyond eye level.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The tragedy of the 41st round begins with the 'absolute throne'.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The scenery of Gwanghwamun unfolded outside the window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An absolute throne occupying the center of the square. Who on earth could have occupied that throne in that chaos?</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much I thought about it, there was only one person who had that possibility.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is it Yoo Jonghyuk?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. He has taken the 'absolute throne'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">With Ye Hyunwoo’s low answer, I felt like something was falling apart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What and where did it go wrong?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did Han Sooyoung and I ultimately fail to change the development of this world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Fortunately."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo said, squeezing my shoulder as if to reassure me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s a little different from the 41st round we expected. Although Yoo Jonghyuk won the 'Absolute Throne', he was unable to exercise the power of the ‘Absolute Throne."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was the throne unable to exercise its power?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly turned my head and my eyes met Ye Hyunwoo’s.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I saw his calm eyes, I felt like I knew why he came here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"So… that’s what we’re curious about. Inho-ssi, what on earth happened that day?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, Killer King, and Dansu ahjussi. Everyone was looking at me as if they had agreed to do so.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"On the day the 'Great Hall' opened, it was Yoo Jonghyuk who brought Inho-ssi back. But even when I asked Yoo Jonghyuk what happened, I couldn’t get an answer."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was natural.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because he doesn't really know what happened that day.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That day, Inho-ssi was wearing the 'Death Sword'. Did Inho-ssi cut down the link of 'Absolute Throne'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I-"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tried to speak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't me who did it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was one more person there that you and I both knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s not me, it’s Han Soo—"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can no longer use the ‘Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard the message, my tongue stiffened before I knew it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">『Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World.』</p>
<p class="orv_line">A skill that protected me after entering this world, and a novel that underpins the foundation of this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja’s favorite story.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can no longer use 'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was someone who gave me this skill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone who felt guilty about me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The person who gave up all of her stories to save me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tried activating the skill again and again.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can no longer use 'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The skill did not activate.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can no longer use 'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The story that once protected Kim Dokja has now left me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Probably with the writer who was trying to give me the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansu, who realized that my condition was strange, grabbed my shoulder and said,</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Everyone, Inho-ssi doesn’t seem to be in good condition, so it would be better to ask later—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, you have to ask right now. We’ve already waited a long time. 'That phenomenon' has been happening for 45 days."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The conversation between Ye Hyunwoo and Killer King could be heard through the buzzing of my ears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Dansu ahjussi, you know what the situation is right now. The only clue to the recent events is Inho-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s an oddity that even I, who’ve read Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint 100 times, can’t figure out. The only person I can trust is that guy."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know what's going on. But there was no answer I could give.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story I know is just the story you all know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I am not as great a person as everyone thinks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because although I am clearly the reincarnation of Kim Dokja, I am not the real Kim Dokja who read 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The real Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Memories slowly returned with a slight headache.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Memories of the very day I killed the 'God of Another World'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason I live here now.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"I will make a contract."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It slowly dawned on me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order to kill the 'God of the Other World', I made a sponsorship contract with that Constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, I could hardly feel his presence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even when I looked up into space or clenched and opened my fists, I didn't feel like anything had changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that the smartphone on the table vibrated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A message appeared on the smartphone screen.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Someone requested a 'midday secret meeting'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, I realized something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was not the smartphone I had.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I already knew who this smartphone belonged to.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Applicant: Demon King of Salvation]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps this was a relic of my inner city.</p>
