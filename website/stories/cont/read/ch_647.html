<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;You&#x27;re useless.&quot;」</div>「"You're useless."」</p>

<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know if this is a sentence from &#x27;Ways of Survival&#x27; or the voice that comes from within Shin Yoosoung. What is certain is that Shin Yoosoung, who is shouting from afar, is gradually losing her confidence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#x27;t listen to other people!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter what I do now, I cannot change the history that has already been written for that child.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I delete a sentence that has already been read once, it will not be deleted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What I can do is to write the next sentence that the child will read darker and clearer.</p>

<p class="orv_line">And in that case, I was more confident than anyone else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You can do whatever you want! You don&#x27;t have to kill monsters! If you think you can be friends, believe it!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This world will not be as easy as the sentence I wrote.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are monsters you can&#x27;t be friends with, and monsters you can&#x27;t tame.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even a monster whose goal is to destroy this world like the &#x27;last dragon of the Apocalypse&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s okay to fail!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">What was in front of Shin Yoosoung now were &#x27;Nagaks&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just because the cruel truth of the world exists in a faraway place, there is no need to trample even the smallest hope in front of you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nagaks can be tamed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung can do it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ll buy you time, so try slowly again and again!&quot;</p>

<p class="orv_line">I tried to help Shin Yoosoung [Tame] with my support. How much time passed?</p>
<p class="orv_line">A thread made of light flowed from Shin Yoosoung&#x27;s fingertips, and was soon connected to a Nagak.</p>

<p class="orv_line">As if she couldn&#x27;t believe what she had done, Shin Yoosoung widened her eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Good job! Continue!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung, who exchanged glances with me, nodded her head with a slightly confident face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I avoided the Nagak&#x27;s ensemble attack, and when I thought there was no place to escape, I hid myself using Nagak&#x27;s shell.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Doo doo doo!</p>
<p class="orv_line">This attack was also easy to avoid because I memorized the pattern.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Kim Dokja said, there is a breaking law in every scenario.</p>

<p class="orv_line">In the meantime, Shin Yoosoung was steadily taming Nagaks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was just dragging time like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was one problem.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 6th-grade sea species &#x27;Ancient Nagak&#x27; shows strange movements.]</div>[The 6th-grade sea species 'Ancient Nagak' shows strange movements.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#x27;Ancient Nagak&#x27; was watching Shin Yoosoung repeat [taming].</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hide!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surprised, Shin Yoosoung quickly dived into the shell of the Nagak without breathing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Subsequently, the ensemble attack of the &#x27;Ancient Nagak&#x27; swept near the Nagak where Shin Yoosoung was hiding.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[6th-grade sea species &#x27;Ancient Nagak&#x27; is indignant!]</div>[6th-grade sea species 'Ancient Nagak' is indignant!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">After staying in the puddle all the way, he moved a heavy note for the first time. The claws caught on its long legs rolled across the terrarium floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It moved its long, tall legs to crush the dead bodies of Nagak one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kwajik!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even without the ensemble, the Ancient Nagak’s physical ability was quite threatening.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I guess so.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it&#x27;s 6th-grade sea species, it&#x27;s a monster on the same level as the &#x27;Titano&#x27; that Lee Gilyoung tamed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Sneaky Schemer&#x27; makes a sad face.]</div>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer' makes a sad face.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I lightly loosened my wrists and activated the [White and Blue Steel].</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Blade of Faith&#x27; is activated!]</div>['Blade of Faith' is activated!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a gigiing sound, a blue blade rose from the Broken Faith.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#x27;t break its shell with the &#x27;Blade of Faith&#x27; made with my magical power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what about its legs?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I ran toward it in a straight line and immediately swung the &#x27;Blade of Faith&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story &#x27;The tenacious Murim master&#x27; speaks hesitantly]</div>[Story 'The tenacious Murim master' speaks hesitantly]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The historical level story received from the ark.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Subsequently, the Ark&#x27;s [Bong method] came into my mind, and the familiar movement of the Ark entered my fingertips in a story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The strangely sluggish and awkward movements changed to those of a top-notch master the moment the story </p>
<p class="orv_line">Sugak!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blow didn&#x27;t cut it off, but the Ancient Nagak’s leg was cut in half.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It stumbled and screamed in pain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized how amazing the skills of the Murim people are.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Humans who polished a single skill again and again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly became curious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The people stronger than the ark, what kind of training did the pajeon swordsman and Kyrgios go through to reach such a level? What kind of scenery is the world they see?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I want to see and write all those stories.」</div>「I want to see and write all those stories.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swung my sword again. One of its legs was completely cut off and it rolled on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was awakened by the sound, resounding like a bloody spirit. When the sea species mouth was released, I was already covered in the blood of a marine species.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[6th-grade marine species prepares for the Ancient Nagak’s &#x27;single ensemble&#x27;!]</div>[6th-grade marine species prepares for the Ancient Nagak’s 'single ensemble'!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy who sucked in his breath in an instant prepared to emit sound waves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Almost reflexively, I fell on my stomach, covering myself with the shells around me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But why?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#x27;t hear its ensemble.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Moments later, a hole opened through the top of the shell with a sound like a crushing sound. The antennae of the guy, visible through the broken back, were hoarding at me as if mocking me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 6th-grade sea species, the Ancient Nagak, starts this short ensemble!]</div>[The 6th-grade sea species, the Ancient Nagak, starts this short ensemble!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was too late to avoid it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The shell no longer served as a protective film.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It had been aiming only for this moment all along.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ahjussi!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw Shin Yoosoung screaming at me from afar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nagak’s grass flute was raised and spread.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I’m going to die.」</div>「I’m going to die.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I die now.</p>

<p class="orv_line">&quot;I am a &#x27;Nagak&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps it was momentarily confused by my [Incite]. However, some of the sound waves apparently flowed through the cracks in the shell and crashed into my eardrums.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My head spun around with a gigiing sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was bleeding from my ear, but fortunately it was an internal injury that I could deal with.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s okay! Go ahead!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung confirmed my state and nodded her head with a relieved expression.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Character &#x27;Shin Yoosoung&#x27; succeeded in taming a &#x27;Nagak&#x27;!]</div>[Character 'Shin Yoosoung' succeeded in taming a 'Nagak'!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps because of the influence of [Incite], the Ancient Nagak was confused about whether I was a human or a Nagak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But soon, as if it didn&#x27;t matter, it came back to swing its claws toward me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I dodged its claws and rolled across the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After playing the ensemble in succession, the guy&#x27;s music skills became a little sluggish.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swung the sword once again without letting go of that gap.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sgarack.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One more leg was cut off. At this rate, there would be no sudden attack. Instead, the guy&#x27;s anger was now completely on me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kunauuu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The tropical air was drawn into the ancient Nagak&#x27;s mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a while, the ensemble will begin again.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Broken Faith&#x27; disappears.]</div>['Broken Faith' disappears.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">Finally, the imitation time limit was over.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was possible to regenerate it by using [Incite] again, but the problem was that it was difficult to maintain the &#x27;Blade of Faith&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked back at Shin Yoosoung repeating [taming] from a distance.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Eventually, she will become the Disaster of Floods.」</div>「Eventually, she will become the Disaster of Floods.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I save Shin Yoosoung here, she will cross over to another world line and become the Disaster of Floods.</p>

<p class="orv_line">That is the fate of this 41st turn.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja&#x27;s words echoed in my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I changed the &#x27;thought&#x27; to a magic recovery bracelet and wore it on my wrist.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Magic recovery bracelet&#x27;s magic regeneration ability increases.]</div>[Magic recovery bracelet's magic regeneration ability increases.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked up at the Ancient Nagak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja promised. He promised to watch my story. He told me to do what I want.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 6th-grade sea species &#x27;Ancient Nagak&#x27; is preparing for a &#x27;wide ensemble&#x27;!]</div>[The 6th-grade sea species 'Ancient Nagak' is preparing for a 'wide ensemble'!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">So I&#x27;ll tell you what I want.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if the end of this world is destruction, even if it&#x27;s an operation that I can&#x27;t change.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Feeling the air around me thinning, I clenched my fists as if clenching the sides.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill &#x27;□□&#x27; is activated!]</div>[The exclusive skill '□□' is activated!]</p>

<p class="orv_line">In the process of obtaining my first story, I lost a skill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I heard the message a while ago, so it wasn&#x27;t something I didn&#x27;t know at all.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This skill cannot be activated with your current skill.]</div>[This skill cannot be activated with your current skill.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was bittersweet for me, who had passed through countless crises thanks to &#x27;□□&#x27;. Being unable to use that skill was as if I wasn&#x27;t qualified as the author of this story yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But then.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some of &#x27;□□&#x27;&#x27;s functions are converted to sub-skills.]</div>[Some of '□□''s functions are converted to sub-skills.]</p>

<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Cheon Inho used &#x27;Incite&#x27;.」</div>「Cheon Inho used 'Incite'.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I felt someone staring at me from behind my head. Immediately, vitality surged through my whole body. Someone who seemed to be able to do anything was born. To be precise.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill &#x27;Incite&#x27; is enhanced!]</div>[Exclusive skill 'Incite' is enhanced!]</p>

<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s a little different when I’m in the &#x27;snowfield&#x27;, but in reality, I can only copy the character&#x27;s behavior, tone, and personality.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, according to the description of the skill now, through this [Incite], I will be able to really use that character&#x27;s power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Without waiting any longer, I activated [Incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">A person who can overcome this crisis without difficulty. A person who could have escaped this dungeon without killing the Nagaks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought while watching Shin Yoosoung repeat [taming] from a distance.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I’m Shin Yoosoung, the &#x27;Disaster of Floods&#x27;.]</div>[I’m Shin Yoosoung, the 'Disaster of Floods'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutchut.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could tell without even trying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This [Incite] is impossible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, it meant that &#x27;Shin Yoosoung, the Disaster of Floods&#x27;, was a much higher-ranking being than I am now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, I thought it would be worth a try since I got two stories.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[6th-grade sea species &#x27;Ancient Nagak&#x27; starts wide-area ensemble!]</div>[6th-grade sea species 'Ancient Nagak' starts wide-area ensemble!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#x27;t take the risk here. If I don&#x27;t succeed, Shin Yoosoung will die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time, I have to overcome the crisis by [Inciting] myself as an existence of a lower rank than me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Ancient Nagak, who took all his breath, started playing an ensemble toward me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought as I hid myself in the shells around me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung, the Disaster of Floods, failed. However, what if Shin Yoosoung is from a different time period?</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, if it were Shin Yoosoung, who was of a lower rank than me. The pages of &#x27;Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint&#x27; began to turn over clearly in my head.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Ahjussi! Don&#x27;t go! Please! Don&#x27;t go!&quot;」</div>「"Ahjussi! Don't go! Please! Don't go!"」</p>

<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung, who participated in &#x27;Journey to the West&#x27;, the grand story of the &lt;Emperor&gt;.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Uh, uh. So... I&#x27;m grateful... for receiving this award...&quot;」</div>「"Uh, uh. So... I'm grateful... for receiving this award..."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung, who participated in the &#x27;War of Good and Evil&#x27;, was talking about her acceptance speech to Kim Dokja.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;...Ahjussi.&quot;」</div>「"...Ahjussi."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung, who was the first to recognize Kim Dokja, who became a giant squid.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The emotions rushing along with the sentences made my head feel like it would explode for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I went against it and traced the history of Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Ahjussi.&quot;」</div>「"Ahjussi."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The voice of Shin Yoosoung calling Kim Dokja over and over again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it because of the Ancient Nagak&#x27;s sound?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though I knew it wasn&#x27;t me she was calling, strangely my heart beat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I read and re-read a story I once wrote.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Ahjussi, but this… can only be used against monsters?&quot;」</div>「"Ahjussi, but this… can only be used against monsters?"」</p>

<p class="orv_line">The horn shell was crushed by the front legs of the &#x27;Ancient Nagak&#x27;, and the sound of the ensemble rushed in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, I felt that my frequent sentences were nesting in me.</p>
