            <div class="orv_title"><h1>906 Episode 50 The World After The End (9)</h1></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (What? Was he always this crazy?) 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the library where a gentle darkness had descended, the Demon King of Salvation frowned as he read the Youngest’s story floating above the newspaper.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Since it’s come to this, should we ride the Reincarnator's bus this time? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The debate between the kkoma Kim Dokjas who read the sentence together could be heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—If you want to find Yoo Joonghyuk, you should follow Nirvana.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—But can you trust Nirvana as a comrade?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Isn’t this all because of the Demon King of Salvation?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (Shut up, you guys.) 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Among them, there was the 'King of Fear' who was mumbling something softly with a slightly sad expression on his face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation said with narrowed eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (Hey, do you think I won’t hear you if you speak so softly?) 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The King of Fear turned his head subtly, looked at the Demon King of Salvation, and slightly moved his lips. The Demon King of Salvation’s eyebrows furrowed.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (The Youngest is like that because of my influence?) 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The King of Fear nodded.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (Stop talking nonsense. No matter how much I am, I don’t get along with a crazy guy like Nirvana. Rather, it must be your influence. The Youngest was originally a bit strange, but he never did anything like that before you came.) 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Instead of refuting that, the King of Fear waved his finger in the air. A sentence rose from the tip of his finger like smoke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That city is strange. I can sense an ominous imagination throughout the city.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (I know. That’s why you’ve been searching the library since a while ago. Hey, did you find the records you need?) 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the Demon King of Salvation’s urging, the Outer Gods scattered throughout the library suddenly stood up and started moving busily.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (Anyway, these kids, if you don’t look at them for a moment…) 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation looked at the Youngest’s records again, thinking that Yoo Sangah, who worked in a place like this, was amazing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'New Murim District.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">In 'Ways of Survival', there were similar rebuilt cities that were born right after the destruction of Murim.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In particular, after Yoo Joonghyuk's 1,500th Round, a unique group called a 'Company' intervened in the Murim that had been eroded by capital and developed the city.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, no matter how he looked at it, the overall system of this city was a little different from the 'Ways of Survival' that he knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In particular, the 'Ascension Ceremony' was strange.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The Constellations that had already ascended to the upper scenarios would not have left behind such a 'friendly' ladder. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If you think about it simply, it is possible that the 'Giant Nebulae' left this scenario area as a bridgehead to strengthen their power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tamra Heavy Industries.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Olympus Technology.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Black Cloud Foundation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Vedas Biotech...</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed like they were giving the incarnations who had not chosen the proper 'Nebulae' one last chance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But is that really all?</p>
<p class="orv_line">They think of the incarnations as consumable terminals, and they can be sacrificed for the 'Descent of the Demi-God' at any time. Were the Constellations of the Giant Nebulae that could be used simply leaving ladders for the purpose of 'recruiting new incarnations'?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (Huh? Did you find it?) 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A kkoma Kim Dokja brought a collection of data. Ancient books that contained information from 1,500th Round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation quickly checked the data. Some of them were already read in 'Ways of Survival', and some looked like a pile of unused settings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And how much time had passed?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The page the Demon King of Salvation was looking for came to mind.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Great Fate. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation's expression hardened for a moment and opened his mouth.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (Second, call the Youngest.) 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The face of the Demon King of Salvation, who had turned slightly pale, was reflected on the retina of the King of Fear who raised his head.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (We have to escape from that city right now.) 」</p></div>

<p class="orv_line">While the commotion of the Ascension Ceremony had died down, I sat next to Nirvana and had a short conversation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"So, after the leader collapsed at that time, that guy…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed that Nirvana had never met Yoo Joonghyuk since he saw him at the Washington Dome.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The tyrant turned into a pig?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana's eyes would flutter open whenever I said something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, well. Strictly speaking, he didn't really turn into a pig. Because of the scenario..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Interesting! The tyrant turned into a pig! What kind of pig was it? Was it a cute flower pig? Or a plump, muscular pig?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It was a pig that ate dirt."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Dirt, dirt? That guy?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, strictly speaking, he didn't really eat dirt, but he ate stories..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana let out a hearty laugh and exclaimed, panting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm looking forward to it! I'm really looking forward to it! This time, the tyrant is a tyrant I have never met before!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What a pity. If only the Church Leader had been with me back then... If only I hadn't met the remnants of the Giant Nebula back then."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't worry! From now on, I'm here! I'll take care of those Constellation bastards who harassed you and Yoo Joonghyuk as many times as I can!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It felt like I suddenly had a strong ally.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana was thinking about something, and then suddenly hardened his expression and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But how do you know so much about Yoo Joonghyuk?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why do you feel closer to Yoo Joonghyuk than I do?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A murderous spirit blooming coldly.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.???', is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled and answered without being flustered at all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm honored that you felt that way."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Have you forgotten? The Church Leader and I are one and the same. If I'm close to Yoo Joonghyuk, then the Church Leader is also close to Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana twitched his lips with blank eyes, then muttered, avoiding eye contact.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What do you know... to say something like that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana looked a little lethargic, but he didn't look that angry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It felt strange to see Nirvana like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, Nirvana always chased Yoo Joonghyuk in the main story. But while he was chasing him, did he ever have a single conversation like this with anyone?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Character, 'Nirvana Möbius', is kind to you!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What kind of person is Yoo Joonghyuk, what does he like, what was he like in the last Round, and what did he do in this Round?</p>
<p class="orv_line">No one would have talked to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana, who always says, "Let's become one."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps Nirvana's expression was an appeal to find someone to share 'this kind of story' with.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This Round, only strange guys are getting involved. That guy Mad Sword Emperor is one of them…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Mad Sword Emperor?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead of answering, Nirvana stared straight ahead. On the other side, he saw Reinheit and Jo Jincheol waking up from their fainting state.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations of &lt;Olympus Technology&gt; and &lt;Black Cloud Foundation&gt; that joined in afterward were approaching us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How dare you point a sword at a fellow Ascendant? We will definitely hold you responsible for this!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We at &lt;Olympus Technology&gt; will remember the taboo that &lt;Tamra Heavy Industries&gt; broke!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana, with a cold smile on his face, slowly stood up from his seat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hold it? The likes of you? The head of the Church?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations flinched at the murderous intent emanating from Nirvana's body and stepped back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Nirvana! You may be the strongest here, but do you think you'll be the same in the higher scenarios?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If only the Elder White Night Sword and the Elder Iron Fist, who ascended last time, were still here…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">White Night Sword and Iron Fist. They were characters whose nicknames I had vaguely heard in 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were Transcendent beings who had reached the realm of transcendence, but they were strong men who had thrown themselves into the Giant Nebula like the 'Master of Spears'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"White Night Sword? Iron Fist? How funny. Do you think the main deity would be afraid of such a bunch of rascals who couldn't even match the footsteps of the Mad Sword Emperor who ascended with them?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Mad Sword Emperor. At that nickname that I heard so often, I quietly turned to the examiner next to me and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who on earth is the Mad Sword Emperor?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, the examiner who liked explanations began to explain with a brighter complexion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He's the incarnation that suddenly appeared a few months ago. He appeared in the scenario with Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, and made a fuss in the 'New Murim District' for a while."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Breaking the Sky Sword Saint?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I remember correctly, Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and the other Transcendents escaped the Fear Realm by riding Surya's train.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So did Breaking the Sky Sword Saint visit this scenario area with Mad Sword Emperor right after getting off the train?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He was a great strongman who had finally appeared, so much so that even Executives from large corporations couldn't match him."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana frowned as if he had overheard the conversation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh, if he had met me, it would have been a different story."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Haha, if he had met Nirvana, it would have been a great match. Now that I think about it, I heard you were looking for Mad Sword Emperor..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana was chasing Mad Sword Emperor?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The Ascension Ceremony is about to begin! Everyone, prepare for [Opening]! Ascendants, please come up to the Ascension Platform!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A shout followed. But instead of going up to the ascension platform, Nirvana pointed to Jo Jincheol and Reinheit, who were still lying on the floor, and said,</p>
<p class="orv_line">"When the Orbital Elevator comes down, take those guys first. I still have work to do here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The examiner, surprised, asked,</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you saying that you're going to postpone the ascension?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. I have work to do with this guy."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana nodded, patting my shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, it was an unexpected turn of events. I had joked that I would take the Reincarnator's bus, but I didn't know that Nirvana would even postpone the ascension.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Church Leader, isn't 'ascension' a very important thing?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even if that's important, is it as important as becoming 'one'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">So becoming 'one'...</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I want to hear more about Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thank goodness. That's what he meant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's when the incarnations came running as if to stop Nirvana.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Lord Nirvana! What on earth are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were incarnations with the symbol of &lt;Tamra Heavy Industries&gt; engraved on them like Nirvana.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't you know how important the ascension is?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you do this all of a sudden, we'll be in trouble too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps because they belong to the same &lt;Tamra Heavy Industries&gt;, they seemed to be less afraid of Nirvana than the other corporate incarnations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Lord Nirvana, if you act so unilaterally like this, even the Chairman will be in trouble."</p>
<p class="orv_line">For the first time, Nirvana let out a short sigh at the mention of the Chairman.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Okay. Then I'll participate in the ascension. Instead, I'll take this guy with me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What does that mean?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It means we'll ascend together."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Countless incarnations suddenly turned their gazes toward me, who appeared to ascend together with Nirvana.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's against the rules! And that newbie isn't even affiliated with &lt;Tamra Heavy Industries&gt;!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How can you mention ascending together with a guy whose rank hasn't been confirmed?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana said with a hardened expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This guy is my 'believer'. My believer is like one body with me! There is absolutely no problem with ascending together!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I understand what you are saying, but strictly speaking, it is not one body, right…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The internal strife of &lt;Tamra Heavy Industries&gt; came to an end when a strong beam of light poured down from the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The Orbital Elevator is coming down!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Orbital Elevator.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At a glance, an elevator wrapped in splendid stories was coming down through a passage of light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed that the 'Ascendants' would take that elevator and leap to the upper scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that Nirvana spoke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Believer."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't look up."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The air in the area was changing rapidly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">People who had been looking up at the Orbital Elevator until then were seen lowering their heads in a hurry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even the arrogant Nirvana lowered his eyes as if he was angry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A bad feeling spread through my entire body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A distant and ominous story covering the sky. Something was looking down from beyond that sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I clenched my fists without realizing it.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellations of the Giant Nebula are here!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The enemies I had to fight were now above my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The stars I had to drop to reach the end of this scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A series of memories flowed and my blood began to boil. The story inside me was stirring.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I told you not to look."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana had come up to me and was standing there with his hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if protecting me, his story, filled with mandalas, was wrapping me up like a lotus.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the next moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kugugugugu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">A terrible thunderclap was heard from the sky above the Ascension Platform. Beyond the thunder ripping through the sky, the Constellations’ angry voices could be heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"W-what…?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The surprised people raised their heads.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is this how the Ascension Ceremony is supposed to be?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I asked, Nirvana shook his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, this is the first time this has happened."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The Orbital Elevator is opening!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The doors of the elevator that had fallen to the ground opened amidst blue sparks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The inside of the elevator was revealed along with the blue-hot flames.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Whether there had been traces of a fierce battle or not, the inside of the elevator was filled with bloody shards. And.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uh, how…!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were already passengers in the elevator.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be exact, they were passengers who had 'been in' the elevator.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"White Night Sword? Iron Fist?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"These are the Ascendants from the last round!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The heads of the White Night Sword and Iron Fist, which had been brutally cut off, were neatly placed on the floor of the elevator.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uh, how, how could this happen—!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The astonished incarnations screamed here and there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Beyond the horribly torn bodies of the Ascendants, there was a message from someone engraved with a sword mark on the wall of the elevator.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And only I.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 No one can escape this city. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I could tell who the sword marks belonged to.</p>
