<p class="orv_line">area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi, who were beside me, started to move nervously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You two together!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if the two of them had just planned a formation, the tanker Kyung Sein stepped forward, and</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi followed behind her, sloppily drawing his sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein looked at me with a serious expression and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There&#x27;s also the &#x27;three together&#x27; formation!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That...... you two look good together.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;In front! There are seven!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein let out a roaring shout and ran forward, only to be gnawed to pieces.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A weak body would be split into two in an instant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Uaaak! It hurts! It hurts! help me!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder how much physique does she have. Despite being bitten here and there by the ground</p>
<p class="orv_line">rats, Kyung Sein was unharmed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then Dansoo ahjussi began do some strange movements.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hang in there, hee-job!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging by the flashy movements, it was clear that if I left them to their own devices, they</p>
<p class="orv_line">wouldn&#x27;t catch a single ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pulled out the thorns I&#x27;d bought and lightly poked the nearest ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Its head exploded like a ripe tomato.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Indeed, Strength level 20 was something else. I started stabbing their heads one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!</p>
<p class="orv_line">In no time at all, I had cleared out five of them, and when I turned around, Kyung Sein and</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi had barely cleared out one each.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When Kyung Sein realized that there were no more ground rats around us, she looked at me in</p>
<p class="orv_line">disbelief and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi, were you actually strong?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I knew it, I knew it!&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">[The constellation &#x27;Abyssal Black Flame Dragon&#x27; points his finger, saying you&#x27;re too proud of</p>
<p class="orv_line">yourself for a power you gained from coins.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#x27;m so excited because it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve used it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After that, we encountered mischiefs of ground rats a few times, but with my strength and agility</p>
<p class="orv_line">exceeding 20, the ground rats were no longer an opponent for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow, Inho-ssi, you&#x27;re awesome.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Heh, I feel strong.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is how the protagonist feels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As we were advancing, beating ground rats one by one, I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh out loud.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Missing it.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well, I&#x27;m sure the other constellations grew up catching ground rats at first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That thought reminded me of Kim Dokja again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Suddenly, I really respect Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He must have crossed the same Yaksu Station tunnel as us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At a much lower level than me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He wasn&#x27;t afraid, he didn&#x27;t back down, and he believed in what he read.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Can I believe in what I write?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There will be no Kim Dokja on this world line, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because this is &#x27;Ways of Survival&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I answered, a memory flashed through my mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered the Kim Dokja in my dream. One of which was really vague, and one of which</p>
<p class="orv_line">was just a kkoma.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is there really no Kim Dokja in this world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But maybe he&#x27;s looking at us from up there, just like we did.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ceiling of the dark tunnel was as dark as a starless night sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein looked up for a moment, then suddenly waved her hand and called out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Dokja! Kim Dokja!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">She shouted it several times.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Naturally, there was no answer from thin air, but Kyung Sein seemed much happier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Dokja.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Kim Dokja is really seeing this world, our positions are now reversed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if I could reach the end of the scenarios like him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wasn&#x27;t sure. But there&#x27;s Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There will be other readers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s hard for one person, but if we all work together, it might be possible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it&#x27;s as Han Sooyoung said, they&#x27;re also &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27;s fragments&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Sneaking Schemer&#x27; nods.]</div>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' nods.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder what form this &#x27;filtering&#x27; takes for the constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that something like starlight flickered across the darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I rushed over to it and saw a flashlight on the floor. Someone had been here before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And beside it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Over here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We looked down into pitch black cave, which opened up beneath our feet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think I found it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the &#x27;Edge of Darkness&#x27;.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">We stepped into the darkness, hand in hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely a passage leading down, but the moment we entered it, gravity magically shifted</p>
<p class="orv_line">toward the wall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was as described in the Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this space filled with black ether, light loses its meaning. In the darkness, you can&#x27;t see a thing,</p>
<p class="orv_line">and you have to rely on your senses to move forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Leading the way was Dansoo ahjussi, who had [Diverse Communication].</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This way.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi sounded encouraged, as if he finally realized he had an important role to play.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein spoke up as if bored.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ahjussi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How old are you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ll be 53 this year.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You mean your original age?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You can talk to us comfortably[1]. Right, Inho-ssi?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. Make yourself comfortable.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel him shaking his head in the darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m comfortable with honorifics.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s respectful of us to do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, he was a very polite man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;May I ask what you used to do for work?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He seemed to think about my question for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Before I came here, I was just unemployed.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if I shouldn&#x27;t have asked, but he continued immediately.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I was in the hospital.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hospital. The moment he said the word, his hand in mine became strangely strong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe that&#x27;s why this world feels more like an opportunity to me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Opportunity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew what he meant, but I thought it would be rude to ask more.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time, ahjussi asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why do you think we&#x27;re here?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the first question that anyone who came to this world would ask themselves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein was the first to answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe we&#x27;re here to experience it, too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">His tone was playful, but it was also a possibility that couldn&#x27;t be ruled out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What do you think, Inho-ssi?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a moment before answering.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe they need someone to complete this story.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh...... I hadn&#x27;t thought of something that profound. So, was it &#x27;Ways of Survival&#x27; that</p>
<p class="orv_line">summoned us?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#x27;t know about that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe it was &lt;Kim Dokja&#x27;s Company&gt;. Kim Dokja? Yoo Jonghyuk?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yoo Joonghyuk, ahjussi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder who called us here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it was &lt;Kim Dokja&#x27;s Company&gt; at first, but now I&#x27;m not sure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder if &lt;Kim Dokja&#x27;s Company&gt; would bring their readers to this dangerous place for any</p>
<p class="orv_line">reason.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Could it be Han Sooyoung? She&#x27;s Omniscient Reader&#x27;s writer after all.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard Kyung Sein&#x27;s words, I felt a strange feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, readers also think that Han Sooyoung is the &#x27;writer&#x27; of this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even I felt a little miserable that I didn&#x27;t have any objection to that fact.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I think about it, &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27; was quite an unusual novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Originally, I had never thought of such a story before. But the story came to me one day out of</p>
<p class="orv_line">the blue.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was as if someone had hit me in the back of the head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Of course, our world line&#x27;s former Omniscient Reader&#x27;s writer is a different person.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">My palms suddenly felt sweaty. I was glad it was pitch black.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#x27;t know what happened to our writer. Maybe he got possessed along with us, or maybe he&#x27;s</p>
<p class="orv_line">already dead because he&#x27;s always writing announcements saying that he&#x27;s sick. I even sent him a</p>
<p class="orv_line">note on how to stretch the other day.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He&#x27;s holding your hand right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Shh. There&#x27;s someone in front of us.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We shut up at ahjussi&#x27;s words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The black ether around us visibly decreased, and we gradually began to see a little further ahead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It meant we were approaching the &#x27;Dark Root&#x27;, the core of the &#x27;Edge of Darkness&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Someone&#x27;s fighting.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We heard the faint sound of a weapon.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have entered the &#x27;Ground Rat&#x27;s Treasure Trove&#x27;.]</div>[You have entered the 'Ground Rat's Treasure Trove'.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Someone is performing a sub scenario.]</div>[Someone is performing a sub scenario.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The bodies of a number of ground rats littered the floor. They were cut from head to stomach</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">with a single sword, so it&#x27;s clear that this person was very good.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I got closer, I saw a dark fire(暗火) burning in the darkness. A somber box under the light of</p>
<p class="orv_line">the dark fire.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the &#x27;random item box&#x27; we were looking for.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Standing in front of it was, as expected, the Dark Keeper.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The battle was already well underway, and the enraged Dark Keeper was casting tentacle</p>
<p class="orv_line">patterns in a frenzy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kallituu!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a short person fighting the Dark Keeper.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein whispered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s the one I saw earlier, on the bike.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A woman with a light blue bob and sunglasses was engaged in a breathtaking battle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was dodging the tentacles with uncanny fluidity, delivering blow after blow. It was as if</p>
<p class="orv_line">she&#x27;d typed in her fighting commands and then executed them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even more shocking was the blue-white ether that flowed faintly from her steel fist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dedicated Sword Force (罡氣功).</p>
<p class="orv_line">It sounded familiar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein muttered under her breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s it, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think so.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked again, sure enough.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was using Kim Dokja&#x27;s [Purest Sword Force].</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered who the hell had robbed that item, but it must have been her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Purest Sword Force is the Purest Sword Force, but I was surprised that she could fight like</p>
<p class="orv_line">that against the Dark Watcher.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What on earth did she do to be able to grow so rapidly from the beginning?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered who she was.</p>

</div>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I saw 12.8 times in parentheses. What the hell?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was at that moment that I felt a cold sensation in the back of my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something pointy touched the back of my neck.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;All three of you, don&#x27;t move. If any of you move, I&#x27;ll kill him.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt goosebumps. I didn&#x27;t notice him at all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Drop your weapons to the ground and slowly put your hands over your heads.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since I didn&#x27;t know my opponent&#x27;s strength level or skill information, it was best to do as I was</p>
<p class="orv_line">told.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he was good enough at stealth to get behind us now, he could attack us at any moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Spot!</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s when the tide turned in the melee up ahead. The woman who had been dodging the</p>
<p class="orv_line">tentacles with her ghostly movements received a cut on her forearm for the first time.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We can help. We&#x27;re not here to be enemies.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We don&#x27;t need help.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#x27;t be greedy. You know you can&#x27;t catch it on your own.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We two are enough.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man spoke to the woman in a calm voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yerin, don&#x27;t panic, fight. The pattern is starting again.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man&#x27;s following words surprised me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The pattern starts at the upper right. After that, there will be one at the bottom, and then you&#x27;ll</p>
<p class="orv_line">have to feed him a series of consecutive strikes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was clearly how Kim Dokja had beaten the &#x27;Dark Keeper&#x27; in &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He remembered it all?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cut off all the tentacles. Then finish it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Blue-white ether surged from the woman&#x27;s fist. It was meant to gather energy and end it in a</p>
<p class="orv_line">single blow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it was a clear mistake.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t write about it in detail in Omniscient Reader, but the Dark Keeper had one final hidden</p>
<p class="orv_line">pattern.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The last pattern that Ji Eunyoo edited out because she thought the battle scene was getting too</p>
<p class="orv_line">long.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sucked in a breath and shouted at the top of my lungs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Dodge! There&#x27;s one more! Last one is from the floor!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as I finished speaking, a tentacle shot out from the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She froze for a moment, but managed to dodge the tentacle before delivering the final blow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kuaaaaaah!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The now incapacitated Dark Keeper fell to his knees and slumped to the ground.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The woman who had just spotted us looked over. I couldn&#x27;t see her eyes through her sunglasses,</p>
<p class="orv_line">but I could tell she was surprised.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A man&#x27;s voice came from behind me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Turn around slowly.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">We slowly turned around with our hands on our heads.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as we turned around, we saw the man holding the &#x27;Stone Hog&#x27;s Pointed Thorn&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was obviously an extra because didn&#x27;t look familiar, but I was impressed that he had a pretty</p>
<p class="orv_line">handsome face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To put it in Ways of Survival terms, it was enough to maybe poke Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s face with a</p>
<p class="orv_line">finger. I immediately activated my skill.</p>
