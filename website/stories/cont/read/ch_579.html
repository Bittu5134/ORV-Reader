<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your strength level have increased significantly!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Passing goblins will be scared away by your strength.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">First of all, my strength should be high.</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your agility level have increased significantly!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your agility will make even a passing elf look back.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I have two left feet, so I'll use my high agility to dodge.</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[Physique Lv.4 → Physique Lv.15]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I need this much physique.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[1,800 coins have been invested into 'Magic Power'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Magic Power Lv.4 → Magic Power Lv.10]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, Magic Power had a birth stat of 4, so I could save some coins.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A total of 15,400 coins have been spent.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Coins Possessed: 1,700 C]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I was down to my last coin, but I had no regrets. You need to increase your stats early on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't until I met Yoo Joonghyuk that I realized this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't have any S-class skills, so when I meet a monster like Yoo Joonghyuk, I have to support my body to withstand even one blow.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are the third incarnation of this scenario to break through Strength level 20.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[300 coins have been acquired as a reward.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are the third incarnation of this scenario to break through Agility level 20.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[300 coins have been acquired as a reward.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Despite hitting Strength and Agility level 20 so quickly, there was someone faster than me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Probably other readers. What a great bunch of guys.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Grrrrr.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Soon, I began to hear the cries of the ground rats. We had finally entered a densely populated area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi, who were beside me, started to move nervously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You two together!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if the two of them had just planned a formation, the tanker Kyung Sein stepped forward, and Dansoo ahjussi followed behind her, sloppily drawing his sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein looked at me with a serious expression and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There's also the 'three together' formation!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That...... you two look good together."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"In front! There are seven!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein let out a roaring shout and ran forward, only to be gnawed to pieces.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A weak body would be split into two in an instant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uaaak! It hurts! It hurts! help me!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder how much physique does she have. Despite being bitten here and there by the ground rats, Kyung Sein was unharmed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then Dansoo ahjussi began do some strange movements.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hang in there, hee-job!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging by the flashy movements, it was clear that if I left them to their own devices, they wouldn't catch a single ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pulled out the thorns I'd bought and lightly poked the nearest ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Its head exploded like a ripe tomato.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Indeed, Strength level 20 was something else. I started stabbing their heads one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!</p>
<p class="orv_line">In no time at all, I had cleared out five of them, and when I turned around, Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi had barely cleared out one each.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When Kyung Sein realized that there were no more ground rats around us, she looked at me in disbelief and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi, were you actually strong?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Of course."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I knew it, I knew it!"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' points his finger, saying you're too proud of yourself for a power you gained from coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I'm so excited because it's the first time I've used it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After that, we encountered mischiefs of ground rats a few times, but with my strength and agility exceeding 20, the ground rats were no longer an opponent for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wow, Inho-ssi, you're awesome."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heh, I feel strong."</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is how the protagonist feels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As we were advancing, beating ground rats one by one, I couldn't help but laugh out loud.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' says this is the only time you can play like this.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' says that the early stages of growth are the most fun.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' agrees that it is.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' blinks nostalgically.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Missing it.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well, I'm sure the other constellations grew up catching ground rats at first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That thought reminded me of Kim Dokja again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Suddenly, I really respect Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He must have crossed the same Yaksu Station tunnel as us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At a much lower level than me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He wasn't afraid, he didn't back down, and he believed in what he read.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Can I believe in what I write?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There will be no Kim Dokja in this world line, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Because this is 'Ways of Survival'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I answered, a memory flashed through my mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered the Kim Dokja in my dream. One of which was really vague, and one of which was just a kkoma.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is there really no Kim Dokja in this world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But maybe he's looking at us from up there, just like we did."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ceiling of the dark tunnel was as dark as a starless night sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein looked up for a moment, then suddenly waved her hand and called out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja! Kim Dokja!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">She shouted it several times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Naturally, there was no answer from thin air, but Kyung Sein seemed much happier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Kim Dokja is really seeing this world, our positions are now reversed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if I could reach the end of the scenarios like him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wasn't sure. But there's Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There will be other readers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's hard for one person, but if we all work together, it might be possible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it's as Han Sooyoung said, they're also 'Kim Dokja's fragments'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' nods.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder what form this 'filtering' takes for the constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that something like starlight flickered across the darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I rushed over to it and saw a flashlight on the floor. Someone had been here before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And beside it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Over here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">We looked down into pitch black cave, which opened up beneath our feet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I think I found it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the 'Edge of Darkness'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">We stepped into the darkness, hand in hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely a passage leading down, but the moment we entered it, gravity magically shifted toward the wall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was as described in the Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this space filled with black ether, light loses its meaning. In the darkness, you can't see a thing, and you have to rely on your senses to move forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Leading the way was Dansoo ahjussi, who had [Diverse Communication].</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This way."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi sounded encouraged, as if he finally realized he had an important role to play.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein spoke up as if bored.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How old are you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll be 53 this year."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You mean your original age?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You can talk to us comfortably¹. Right, Inho-ssi?"</p>
<div class="orv_notice"><p>[1] They mean casually, without honorifics.</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. Make yourself comfortable."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel him shaking his head in the darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm comfortable with honorifics."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't think that's respectful of us to do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, he was a very polite man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"May I ask what you used to do for work?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">He seemed to think about my question for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Before I came here, I was just unemployed."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if I shouldn't have asked, but he continued immediately.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I was in the hospital."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hospital. The moment he said the word, his hand in mine became strangely strong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Maybe that's why this world feels more like an opportunity to me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Opportunity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew what he meant, but I thought it would be rude to ask more.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time, ahjussi asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why do you think we're here?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the first question that anyone who came to this world would ask themselves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein was the first to answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Maybe we're here to experience it, too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">His tone was playful, but it was also a possibility that couldn't be ruled out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What do you think, Inho-ssi?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a moment before answering.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Maybe they need someone to complete this story."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh...... I hadn't thought of something that profound. So, was it 'Ways of Survival' that summoned us?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't know about that."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Maybe it was &lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt;. Kim Dokja? Yoo Jonghyuk?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Joonghyuk, ahjussi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder who called us here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it was &lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt; at first, but now I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder if &lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt; would bring their readers to this dangerous place for any reason.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Could it be Han Sooyoung? She's Omniscient Reader's writer after all."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard Kyung Sein's words, I felt a strange feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, readers also think that Han Sooyoung is the 'writer' of this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even I felt a little miserable that I didn't have any objection to that fact.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I think about it, 'Omniscient Reader' was quite an unusual novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Originally, I had never thought of such a story before. But the story came to me one day out of the blue.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was as if someone had hit me in the back of the head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Of course, our world line's former Omniscient Reader's writer is a different person......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">My palms suddenly felt sweaty. I was glad it was pitch black.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't know what happened to our writer. Maybe he got possessed along with us, or maybe he's already dead because he's always writing announcements saying that he's sick. I even sent him a note on how to stretch the other day."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He's holding your hand right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Shh. There's someone in front of us."</p>
<p class="orv_line">We shut up at ahjussi's words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The black ether around us visibly decreased, and we gradually began to see a little further ahead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It meant we were approaching the 'Dark Root', the core of the 'Edge of Darkness'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Someone's fighting."</p>
<p class="orv_line">We heard the faint sound of a weapon.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have entered the 'Ground Rat's Treasure Trove'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Someone is performing a sub scenario.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The bodies of a number of ground rats littered the floor. They were cut from head to stomach with a single sword, so it's clear that this person was very good.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I got closer, I saw a dark fire(暗火) burning in the darkness. A somber box under the light of the dark fire.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the 'random item box' we were looking for.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Standing in front of it was, as expected, the Dark Keeper.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The battle was already well underway, and the enraged Dark Keeper was casting tentacle patterns in a frenzy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kallituu!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a short person fighting the Dark Keeper.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein whispered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's the one I saw earlier, on the bike."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A woman with a light blue bob and sunglasses was engaged in a breathtaking battle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was dodging the tentacles with uncanny fluidity, delivering blow after blow. It was as if she'd typed in her fighting commands and then executed them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even more shocking was the blue-white ether that flowed faintly from her steel fist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dedicated Sword Force (罡氣功).</p>
<p class="orv_line">It sounded familiar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein muttered under her breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's it, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I think so."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked again, sure enough.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was using Kim Dokja's [Purest Sword Force].</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered who the hell had robbed that item, but it must have been her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Purest Sword Force is the Purest Sword Force, but I was surprised that she could fight like that against the Dark Watcher.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What on earth did she do to be able to grow so rapidly from the beginning?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered who she was.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Character List' is activated!]</p></div>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[This person is a 'character' but not a 'character'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That woman is definitely a 'reader'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe she's one of the 'pros' Kyung Sein mentioned.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Using 'Readers' Comments List' in this person.]</p></div>

<p class="orv_line">0 complete reads.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That means she's never read Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And yet she can fight like that?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The reader has no record of having read 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Additional information about the target has been updated.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some of the 'List Information' is corrected.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When I checked again, some of the information had changed.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>Number of Reads: 0 times (12.8 times)</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I saw 12.8 times in parentheses. What the hell?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was at that moment that I felt a cold sensation in the back of my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something pointy touched the back of my neck.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"All three of you, don't move. If any of you move, I'll kill him."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt goosebumps. I didn't notice him at all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Drop your weapons to the ground and slowly put your hands over your heads."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since I didn't know my opponent's strength level or skill information, it was best to do as I was told.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he was good enough at stealth to get behind us now, he could attack us at any moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Spot!</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's when the tide turned in the melee up ahead. The woman who had been dodging the tentacles with her ghostly movements received a cut on her forearm for the first time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We can help. We're not here to be enemies."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We don't need help."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't be greedy. You know you can't catch it on your own."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We two are enough."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man spoke to the woman in a calm voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yerin, don't panic, fight. The pattern is starting again."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man's following words surprised me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The pattern starts at the upper right. After that, there will be one at the bottom, and then you'll have to feed him a series of consecutive strikes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was clearly how Kim Dokja had beaten the 'Dark Keeper' in 'Omniscient Reader'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He remembered it all?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Cut off all the tentacles. Then finish it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Blue-white ether surged from the woman's fist. It was meant to gather energy and end it in a single blow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it was a clear mistake.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't write about it in detail in Omniscient Reader, but the Dark Keeper had one final hidden pattern.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The last pattern that Ji Eunyoo edited out because she thought the battle scene was getting too long.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sucked in a breath and shouted at the top of my lungs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Dodge! There's one more! Last one is from the floor!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as I finished speaking, a tentacle shot out from the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She froze for a moment, but managed to dodge the tentacle before delivering the final blow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kuaaaaaah!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The now incapacitated Dark Keeper fell to his knees and slumped to the ground.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The woman who had just spotted us looked over. I couldn't see her eyes through her sunglasses, but I could tell she was surprised.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A man's voice came from behind me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Turn around slowly."</p>
<p class="orv_line">We slowly turned around with our hands on our heads.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as we turned around, we saw the man holding the 'Stone Hog's Pointed Thorn'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was obviously an extra because he didn't look familiar, but I was impressed that he had a pretty handsome face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To put it in Ways of Survival terms, it was enough to maybe poke Yoo Joonghyuk's face with a finger. I immediately activated my skill.</p>
