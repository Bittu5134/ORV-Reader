<p class="orv_line">I continued to speak to Han Sooyoung, who did not answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aren’t you going to tie Yoo Joonghyuk here and lock him in a movie that repeats forever?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, only a small part of the tragedy that will happen in this world due to Yoo Joonghyuk will occur.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it was Han Soo-young, she would have already sent her [Avatar] outside.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Under her plan, the world will quietly perish, and Shin Yoosung will become a lost child of the worldline and embark on a journey to become a &#x27;disaster&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That is the complete ending of this 41st turn designed by Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After thinking for a moment, Han Sooyoung opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yeah, right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why do you have to go this far?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If it&#x27;s a world that&#x27;s going to perish anyway, why don&#x27;t we reduce the pain of destruction?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if deciding the end of a world, Han Sooyoung continued her words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You know what kind of guy Yoo Joonghyuk is in this world.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung was looking at Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Not all Yoo Joonghyuk are good guys. Yoo Joonghyuk is also human, and he makes mistakes. Yoo Joonghyuk in the 41st turn is a guy who will make a lot of mistakes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what she was seeing was probably not the bequest power of this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A distant shadow of a tale passed over her eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From the 0th turn to the 1865th turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To Han Sooyoung, who described Omniscient Reader Viewpoint, &#x27;Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27; may not be a character, but a phenomenon and concept.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s a mistake that hasn&#x27;t happened yet.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of Yoo Joonghyuk who had talked to me and Yoo Joonghyuk who had confided in Cheon Inho of the 40th turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk wanted to see the end of this world, even by borrowing the hands of the wicked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk tried to teach the people of Geumho Station how to hunt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk, who left &#x27;The Spirit of Elaine Forest&#x27; for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is Yoo Joonghyuk really a bad guy?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We may change it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you do that, something worse will happen.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something worse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you change the story, another worldline will be born starting from this turn. Also, a universe of countless scenarios will be born.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like my heart was tightening.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You asked why I came here?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was quiet anger in Han Sooyoung&#x27;s voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I have come down to the conclusion of this whole story. To stop this damn tragedy that never ends no matter how much I close it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I heard that story, I felt sad for some reason. Maybe it&#x27;s because I remembered Han Sooyoung&#x27;s sentence.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Forever and ever, I will write a final chapter for you.」</div>「Forever and ever, I will write a final chapter for you.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung, who had written that sentence for Kim Dokja when he was young, was now trying to write the last sentence that would end all this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It could be.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I benefit from her like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I&#x27;m curious about one thing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why does her face as she tries to write the last sentence look so sad?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This kind of ending is unacceptable.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I am.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who am I?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I am someone who is still using the Omniscient Reader&#x27;s Point of view that you started.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung was silent for a moment, as if she could understand what those words meant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And she asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you sure?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I am not confident.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had never written a story because I was confident.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There is still a story to be told.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment her Han Sooyoung was about to open her mouth, I kicked off the floor and ran toward her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Whatever her Han Sooyoung&#x27;s purpose was, I couldn&#x27;t just sit by and watch the situation.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I must clear ‘Theatre Dungeon’.」</div>「I must clear ‘Theatre Dungeon’.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only then can I save Killer King.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">It can liberate other readers who may have been at risk of being overworked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I can save Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung&#x27;s left hand moved with a sound like chi-chi-tsu. The flame of [Black Flame] in her hand flew towards me, burning the roof floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I breathed in as hard as I could and cried out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Turn into the shield of Hercules.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill, &#x27;Incite Lv.6&#x27; is activated!]</div>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.6' is activated!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Thoughts of almost everything&#x27; turned into a replica version of &#x27;Hercules&#x27; Shield obtained&#x27; from the room of rewards.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You’ve activate the special skill &#x27;wide area defense&#x27;!]</div>[You’ve activate the special skill 'wide area defense'!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">A translucent barrier spread around the shield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung&#x27;s [Black Flame] melted more than half of the shield and then scattered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her hands and feet were searing hot, and her breathing was labored by the heat that burned all around her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I endured the frenzy and opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Heewon-ssi. Are you there?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then a voice came from behind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How did you know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Holding &#x27;Mikazuki Munechika&#x27; in her left hand and wearing &#x27;impossible mission&#x27; on her body, Jung Heewon was standing behind me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said without looking back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I thought it was time for you to wake up. When did you wake up?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;From the white room earlier.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon laughed for a while. She added, standing beside me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You said something important, so I thought I shouldn’t interrupt you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What about now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I thought you would die if I didn’t interfere.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We smiled at each other for a while. As if her physical condition has recovered properly, Jung Heewon&#x27;s whole body wriggled with a deep magical blue.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That person is very strong.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jeong Heewon, who took a glance at Han Sooyoung, nodded her head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I see.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pointed to the Theater Owner in front of Han Sooyoung and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The target is not her. It is the old man in front of him.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you get rid of that, this dungeon will end too, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung listened to our conversation in silence from a distance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A look that assures us that things won&#x27;t change no matter what we do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if she didn&#x27;t like her attitude, Jung Heewon stepped in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you know what you said to me before passing out? Please do it one more time.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought about what that meant and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You may pass out again.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s frustrating, but now I feel like I won’t be able to win if I don’t listen to it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sparks flashed in Jung Heewon&#x27;s eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A voice that has already made up its mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the painting fell, the tie was only now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When Han Sooyoung is even a little bit off guard. I opened my mouth to bring out the strongest card we can use.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Every enemy in front of you from now on.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now, it was our turn to tell our story.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill &#x27;Incitement Lv.6&#x27; is activated!]</div>[Exclusive skill 'Incitement Lv.6' is activated!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They are monsters.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words as a signal, the wave of her magic power exploded from Jung Heewon&#x27;s body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Character Jung Heewon requests the activation of &#x27;Time of Judgment&#x27;.]</div>[Character Jung Heewon requests the activation of 'Time of Judgment'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, the indirect message from the constellations echoed in my head.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellation &#x27;Tiger eating rice cake&#x27; agrees with Incarnation &#x27;Jung Heewon&#x27;.]</div>[Constellation 'Tiger eating rice cake' agrees with Incarnation 'Jung Heewon'.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">And.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Time of Judgment has been activated.]</div>[Time of Judgment has been activated.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon ran up the roof with a roar. The acceleration was enough to open the eyes of Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung&#x27;s left hand moved hurriedly and emitted [Black Flame].</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Mikazuki Munechika&#x27;&#x27;s special option &#x27;Traces of the Four Gods&#x27; is activated!]</div>['Mikazuki Munechika''s special option 'Traces of the Four Gods' is activated!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon&#x27;s new weapon, which is as dark as a shadow, reached right in front of Han Sooyoung, avoiding the flames of [Black Flame].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Movements that show no hesitation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The magical power in her right hand dyed Mikazuki Munechika&#x27;s blade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a perfect sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon&#x27;s [sword] with a blue strong spirit aimed exactly at the neck of the Theater Owner.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s rare. This isn&#x27;t the [Judgment Hour] I know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With the voice, Jung Heewon&#x27;s sword stopped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if there was an invisible force of repulsion between Han Sooyoung and Jung Heewon, Jung Heewon&#x27;s sword trembled in the air and was pushed away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I belatedly realized what had happened.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Theatre Owner attempts &#x27;mental erosion&#x27;!]</div>[The Theatre Owner attempts 'mental erosion'!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">During that short interval, Han Sooyoung borrowed the skill of the Theater Owner and attacked Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damnit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Heewon-ssi! Step back!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon&#x27;s eyes slowly grew cloudy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon said that among the members of &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt;, she is especially vulnerable to mental attacks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From the beginning, there was no way she could withstand the attack of the Theater Owner.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I hurriedly ran and reached out my hand toward Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ve been stuck there for years.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With Han Sooyoung&#x27;s words, her vision flipped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung, who grabbed my wrist, turned me over and pinned me to the floor. An excruciating pain ran down my back, and I was choking on my breath. I could feel the narration flowing through her fingertips and overturning my energy and blood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A level of power difference that is not even a fight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Blood gushed from my mouth, and my consciousness went out for a moment and then came back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This, that thing.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I heard Jung Heewon&#x27;s voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I slowly opened my eyes, I saw Jung Heewon staggering forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is-&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Blood vessels burst from her eyes, and Jung Heewon took a step forward, bleeding from her bitten lips.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Soo-young made an admiring face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You. You’re a bit different from the Jung Heewon I know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something immediately came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, something similar happened in [Illusion Prison].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though she received the item&#x27;s equipping effect, Jung Heewon defeated the specters without suffering any trauma.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The Jung Heewon of this world has no trauma associated with the villains of Geumho Station.」</div>「The Jung Heewon of this world has no trauma associated with the villains of Geumho Station.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#x27;t her hatred of the bad guys that awakened her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The regular member of the 41st turn is a person who became a &#x27;judge&#x27; only to save me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung muttered in a low voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s surprising that the regular member is still alive…. Why is the 41st turn so interesting?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With just a moment of encounter, Han Sooyoung seemed to be blinded by the new history of Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But to say that Inho is on your side, the Jung Heewon, whom I know, would be sad to see it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Jung Heewon. Aren&#x27;t you curious what the original story was like?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The tip of her white finger touched Jung Heewon&#x27;s forehead in a magical trajectory.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A grand narrative &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27;s Viewpoint&#x27; begins its storytelling.]</div>[A grand narrative 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see Jung Heewon&#x27;s pupils widening. I also got goosebumps on my forearms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#x27;t clear what exactly Jung Heewon was looking at, but it wasn&#x27;t hard to imagine that it was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;See? That&#x27;s the true identity of that person you believe in.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was watching the story of the 3rd turn.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;My name is Cheon Inho.&quot;」</div>「"My name is Cheon Inho."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be precise, she was looking at the Cheon Inho of that world.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;You&#x27;re right. Scouts receive more rations. So, if you want to get food, please join the scouting party.&quot;」</div>「"You're right. Scouts receive more rations. So, if you want to get food, please join the scouting party."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The villain of Geumho Station. The one who bullied people and put Jung Heewon in danger of dying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho, the leader of the Deolsoo group.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The guy&#x27;s words did not continue. It&#x27;s because Jung Heewon, who appeared from behind, pierced Cheon Inho&#x27;s face from the top of his head.」</div>「The guy's words did not continue. It's because Jung Heewon, who appeared from behind, pierced Cheon Inho's face from the top of his head.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that world, Jung Heewon killed Cheon Inho and regained her life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story did not end there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Blood flowed from Jung Heewon&#x27;s nose and mouth as she watched the stories of the third turn flowing like a panorama.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at Jeong Hee-won, Han Soo-young was making an unknown expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, Han Sooyoung was like a demon king, a dokkaebi, and a constellation. Han Sooyoung looked like a god.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story of her life explained her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The stories gathered one by one while overcoming the risk of dying countless times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was standing on the far-flung text where &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; and Han Sooyoung’s day-to-day gatherings were gathered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She is unreachable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A story that leaves you in awe just by looking at it. At the top of the story, Han Soo-young was omnipotent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Like a child who effortlessly knocks down a poorly built Jenga. She was destroying Jung Heewon with her nonchalant fingers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It felt like all the strength was draining from her body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She said, &quot;Look carefully at who you are trying to be loyal to. See what life you should have had.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The history of this world, our lives, built up with my crude sentences, were collapsing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hallucination…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s not a hallucination.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Even if this is true.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon stuttered and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her eyes were glistening with a terrible light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This world is… not that… world.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment she heard those words, her eyes flashed as if she had been bathed in cold water.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Power returned to her fingertips. My dizzy vision returned to its place. I fumbled on the floor and stood up.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「This world is not 『Omniscient Reader&#x27;s Viewpoint』.」</div>「This world is not 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was right.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Because this world has never been properly described.」</div>「Because this world has never been properly described.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stumbled and took one step, then two again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung turned to me as if warning me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you come any closer, you will die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Were you originally going to save me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung&#x27;s hand, enveloped in [Black Flame], slowly aimed at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at her like that, I thought.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Really, this world is not the 『Omniscient Reader&#x27;s Viewpoint』 that I know.」</div>「Really, this world is not the 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』 that I know.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">What I can and cannot do now. Sentences I can write and sentences I cannot write.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「A new sentence is needed in this world now.」</div>「A new sentence is needed in this world now.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">And a piece of blank paper, needed to write a &#x27;sentence&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Han Soo-young&#x27;s [Black Flame] shot at me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You want to do something unexpected.]</div>[You want to do something unexpected.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I decided to write her &#x27;sentence&#x27; against her.</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[Entering the ‘Snowfield’.]</div>[Entering the ‘Snowfield’.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">And in the next moment, something that had never happened before happened.</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[The total amount of time you can stay in &#x27;Snowfield&#x27; is ? minutes.]</div>[The total amount of time you can stay in 'Snowfield' is ? minutes.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The manuscript paper in front of my eyes was all broken. Neither the remaining time nor the limited number of characters were indicated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I blankly stared at the blank space, then suddenly smiled.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Suddenly, Lee Hak-hyun felt everything that was free.」</div>「Suddenly, Lee Hak-hyun felt everything that was free.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if rejecting the rule of time, only I was awake in a world where everyone stopped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A feeling that whatever sentence I write will come true. A feeling that I can write whatever sentence I want to my heart&#x27;s content.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered the first sentence.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Lee Hak-hyun moved his hand.」</div>「Lee Hak-hyun moved his hand.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">This snowy field is a world between the lines where all time and space are frozen. So I couldn&#x27;t be physically free either.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Then his hand moved.」</div>「Then his hand moved.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">But strangely, my hand moved.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「When I moved, my step falls, and when I clench my fist, my fist clenches.」</div>「When I moved, my step falls, and when I clench my fist, my fist clenches.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know why this happened, but maybe this was an opportunity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If only I could use this situation to kill the Theater Owner.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This world is between the lines where only I can stay. If this is possible, I would do it without anyone interfering-</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsutsutsu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that intense sparks flew in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Through the sparks’ bright light, someone was looking this way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s fun. Does this happen?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard her voice, I felt my heart sink.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung was there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is your ability.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if protecting her, I could see the flow of letters coiling around her. She, like me, defied the restraints of time. Standing freely in the center of the snowfield.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Above the lines and sentences, only two writers have escaped the rule of time.」</div>「Above the lines and sentences, only two writers have escaped the rule of time.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, I felt the gaze of a very faintly shining star on the far side of the snowfield.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「And one reader watched it.」</div>「And one reader watched it.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I blankly looked up at the sky, then lowered my head to look at Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The stage was set, and what I had to do was clear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are two writers here now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But in the end, what is recorded here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There is only one story.&quot;</p>
