<p class="orv_line">I continued to speak to Han Sooyoung, who did not answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aren’t you going to tie Yoo Joonghyuk here and lock him in a movie that repeats forever?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, only a small part of the tragedy that will happen in this world due to Yoo Joonghyuk will occur.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it was Han Soo-young, she would have already sent her [Avatar] outside.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Under her plan, the world will quietly perish, and Shin Yoosung will become a lost child of the worldline and embark on a journey to become a 'disaster'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That is the complete ending of this 41st turn designed by Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After thinking for a moment, Han Sooyoung opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yeah, right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why do you have to go this far?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If it's a world that's going to perish anyway, why don't we reduce the pain of destruction?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if deciding the end of a world, Han Sooyoung continued her words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You know what kind of guy Yoo Joonghyuk is in this world."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung was looking at Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Not all Yoo Joonghyuk are good guys. Yoo Joonghyuk is also human, and he makes mistakes. Yoo Joonghyuk in the 41st turn is a guy who will make a lot of mistakes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what she was seeing was probably not the bequest power of this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A distant shadow of a tale passed over her eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From the 0th turn to the 1865th turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To Han Sooyoung, who described Omniscient Reader Viewpoint, 'Yoo Joonghyuk' may not be a character, but a phenomenon and concept.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's a mistake that hasn't happened yet."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of Yoo Joonghyuk who had talked to me and Yoo Joonghyuk who had confided in Cheon Inho of the 40th turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk wanted to see the end of this world, even by borrowing the hands of the wicked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk tried to teach the people of Geumho Station how to hunt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk, who left 'The Spirit of Elaine Forest' for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is Yoo Joonghyuk really a bad guy?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We may change it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you do that, something worse will happen."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something worse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you change the story, another worldline will be born starting from this turn. Also, a universe of countless scenarios will be born."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like my heart was tightening.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You asked why I came here?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was quiet anger in Han Sooyoung's voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I have come down to the conclusion of this whole story. To stop this damn tragedy that never ends no matter how much I close it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I heard that story, I felt sad for some reason. Maybe it's because I remembered Han Sooyoung's sentence.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Forever and ever, I will write a final chapter for you. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung, who had written that sentence for Kim Dokja when he was young, was now trying to write the last sentence that would end all this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It could be.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I benefit from her like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I'm curious about one thing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why does her face as she tries to write the last sentence look so sad?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This kind of ending is unacceptable."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who are you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who am I?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am someone who is still using the Omniscient Reader's Point of view that you started."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung was silent for a moment, as if she could understand what those words meant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And she asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you sure?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am not confident."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had never written a story because I was confident.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There is still a story to be told."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment her Han Sooyoung was about to open her mouth, I kicked off the floor and ran toward her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Whatever her Han Sooyoung's purpose was, I couldn't just sit by and watch the situation.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I must clear ‘Theatre Dungeon’. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Only then can I save Killer King.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">It can liberate other readers who may have been at risk of being overworked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I can save Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung's left hand moved with a sound like chi-chi-tsu. The flame of [Black Flame] in her hand flew towards me, burning the roof floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I breathed in as hard as I could and cried out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Turn into the shield of Hercules."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.6' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'Thoughts of almost everything' turned into a replica version of 'Hercules' Shield obtained' from the room of rewards.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You’ve activate the special skill 'wide area defense'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A translucent barrier spread around the shield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung's [Black Flame] melted more than half of the shield and then scattered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her hands and feet were searing hot, and her breathing was labored by the heat that burned all around her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I endured the frenzy and opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-ssi. Are you there?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then a voice came from behind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How did you know?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Holding 'Mikazuki Munechika' in her left hand and wearing 'impossible mission' on her body, Jung Heewon was standing behind me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said without looking back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I thought it was time for you to wake up. When did you wake up?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"From the white room earlier."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon laughed for a while. She added, standing beside me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You said something important, so I thought I shouldn’t interrupt you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What about now?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I thought you would die if I didn’t interfere."</p>
<p class="orv_line">We smiled at each other for a while. As if her physical condition has recovered properly, Jung Heewon's whole body wriggled with a deep magical blue.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That person is very strong."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jeong Heewon, who took a glance at Han Sooyoung, nodded her head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I see."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pointed to the Theater Owner in front of Han Sooyoung and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The target is not her. It is the old man in front of him."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you get rid of that, this dungeon will end too, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung listened to our conversation in silence from a distance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A look that assures us that things won't change no matter what we do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if she didn't like her attitude, Jung Heewon stepped in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you know what you said to me before passing out? Please do it one more time."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought about what that meant and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You may pass out again."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s frustrating, but now I feel like I won’t be able to win if I don’t listen to it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sparks flashed in Jung Heewon's eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A voice that has already made up its mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the painting fell, the tie was only now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When Han Sooyoung is even a little bit off guard. I opened my mouth to bring out the strongest card we can use.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Every enemy in front of you from now on."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now, it was our turn to tell our story.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Incitement Lv.6' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"They are monsters."</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words as a signal, the wave of her magic power exploded from Jung Heewon's body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Character Jung Heewon requests the activation of 'Time of Judgment'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then, the indirect message from the constellations echoed in my head.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellation 'Tiger eating rice cake' agrees with Incarnation 'Jung Heewon'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellation 'Lord of mischief' agrees with Incarnation 'Jung Heewon'’s will.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Pig living in a brick house' agrees with Incarnation ‘Jung Heewon'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellation 'Taejo's cow’' agrees with Incarnation 'Jung Heewon''s will.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Time of Judgment has been activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon ran up the roof with a roar. The acceleration was enough to open the eyes of Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung's left hand moved hurriedly and emitted [Black Flame].</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Mikazuki Munechika''s special option 'Traces of the Four Gods' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon's new weapon, which is as dark as a shadow, reached right in front of Han Sooyoung, avoiding the flames of [Black Flame].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Movements that show no hesitation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The magical power in her right hand dyed Mikazuki Munechika's blade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a perfect sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon's [sword] with a blue strong spirit aimed exactly at the neck of the Theater Owner.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s rare. This isn't the [Judgment Hour] I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">With the voice, Jung Heewon's sword stopped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if there was an invisible force of repulsion between Han Sooyoung and Jung Heewon, Jung Heewon's sword trembled in the air and was pushed away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I belatedly realized what had happened.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Theatre Owner attempts 'mental erosion'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">During that short interval, Han Sooyoung borrowed the skill of the Theater Owner and attacked Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damnit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-ssi! Step back!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon's eyes slowly grew cloudy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon said that among the members of &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt;, she is especially vulnerable to mental attacks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From the beginning, there was no way she could withstand the attack of the Theater Owner.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I hurriedly ran and reached out my hand toward Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I've been stuck there for years."</p>
<p class="orv_line">With Han Sooyoung's words, her vision flipped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung, who grabbed my wrist, turned me over and pinned me to the floor. An excruciating pain ran down my back, and I was choking on my breath. I could feel the narration flowing through her fingertips and overturning my energy and blood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A level of power difference that is not even a fight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Blood gushed from my mouth, and my consciousness went out for a moment and then came back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This, that thing."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I heard Jung Heewon's voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I slowly opened my eyes, I saw Jung Heewon staggering forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This is-"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Blood vessels burst from her eyes, and Jung Heewon took a step forward, bleeding from her bitten lips.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Soo-young made an admiring face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You. You’re a bit different from the Jung Heewon I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something immediately came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, something similar happened in [Illusion Prison].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though she received the item's equipping effect, Jung Heewon defeated the specters without suffering any trauma.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The Jung Heewon of this world has no trauma associated with the villains of Geumho Station. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't her hatred of the bad guys that awakened her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The regular member of the 41st turn is a person who became a 'judge' only to save me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung muttered in a low voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s surprising that the regular member is still alive…. Why is the 41st turn so interesting?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">With just a moment of encounter, Han Sooyoung seemed to be blinded by the new history of Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But to say that Inho is on your side, the Jung Heewon, whom I know, would be sad to see it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Jung Heewon. Aren't you curious what the original story was like?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The tip of her white finger touched Jung Heewon's forehead in a magical trajectory.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A grand narrative 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I could see Jung Heewon's pupils widening. I also got goosebumps on my forearms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't clear what exactly Jung Heewon was looking at, but it wasn't hard to imagine that it was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"See? That's the true identity of that person you believe in."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was watching the story of the 3rd turn.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "My name is Cheon Inho." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">To be precise, she was looking at the Cheon Inho of that world.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "You're right. Scouts receive more rations. So, if you want to get food, please join the scouting party." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The villain of Geumho Station. The one who bullied people and put Jung Heewon in danger of dying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho, the leader of the Deolsoo group.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The guy's words did not continue. It's because Jung Heewon, who appeared from behind, pierced Cheon Inho's face from the top of his head. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In that world, Jung Heewon killed Cheon Inho and regained her life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story did not end there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Blood flowed from Jung Heewon's nose and mouth as she watched the stories of the third turn flowing like a panorama.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at Jeong Hee-won, Han Soo-young was making an unknown expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, Han Sooyoung was like a demon king, a dokkaebi, and a constellation. Han Sooyoung looked like a god.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story of her life explained her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The stories gathered one by one while overcoming the risk of dying countless times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was standing on the far-flung text where &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; and Han Sooyoung’s day-to-day gatherings were gathered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She is unreachable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A story that leaves you in awe just by looking at it. At the top of the story, Han Soo-young was omnipotent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Like a child who effortlessly knocks down a poorly built Jenga. She was destroying Jung Heewon with her nonchalant fingers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It felt like all the strength was draining from her body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She said, "Look carefully at who you are trying to be loyal to. See what life you should have had."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The history of this world, our lives, built up with my crude sentences, were collapsing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hallucination…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's not a hallucination."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even if this is true."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon stuttered and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her eyes were glistening with a terrible light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This world is… not that… world."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment she heard those words, her eyes flashed as if she had been bathed in cold water.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Power returned to her fingertips. My dizzy vision returned to its place. I fumbled on the floor and stood up.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 This world is not 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was right.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Because this world has never been properly described. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I stumbled and took one step, then two again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung turned to me as if warning me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you come any closer, you will die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Were you originally going to save me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung's hand, enveloped in [Black Flame], slowly aimed at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at her like that, I thought.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Really, this world is not the 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』 that I know. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What I can and cannot do now. Sentences I can write and sentences I cannot write.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 A new sentence is needed in this world now. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And a piece of blank paper, needed to write a 'sentence'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Han Soo-young's [Black Flame] shot at me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You want to do something unexpected.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I decided to write her 'sentence' against her.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Describe your actions.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Consumes 5 points of probability.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The activation conditions for the exclusive skill '□□' have been met.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The color of the world changed to achromatic and time stopped.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Entering the ‘Snowfield’.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And in the next moment, something that had never happened before happened.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[An error has occurred in 'Snowfield'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>#□□</p>
<p><&>「□□?□□?□?□□?□□□?□□□□□□□?□□□?□□□?□□?□□□□□?□□□?□□□?□□…」</p>
<p>*Based on the current proficiency, a total of ? additional characters are possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The total amount of time you can stay in 'Snowfield' is ? minutes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The manuscript paper in front of my eyes was all broken. Neither the remaining time nor the limited number of characters were indicated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I blankly stared at the blank space, then suddenly smiled.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Suddenly, Lee Hak-hyun felt everything that was free. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As if rejecting the rule of time, only I was awake in a world where everyone stopped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A feeling that whatever sentence I write will come true. A feeling that I can write whatever sentence I want to my heart's content.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered the first sentence.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Lee Hak-hyun moved his hand. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This snowy field is a world between the lines where all time and space are frozen. So I couldn't be physically free either.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Then his hand moved. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But strangely, my hand moved.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 When I moved, my step falls, and when I clench my fist, my fist clenches. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know why this happened, but maybe this was an opportunity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If only I could use this situation to kill the Theater Owner.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This world is between the lines where only I can stay. If this is possible, I would do it without anyone interfering-</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsutsutsu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that intense sparks flew in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Through the sparks’ bright light, someone was looking this way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s fun. Does this happen?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard her voice, I felt my heart sink.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung was there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This is your ability."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if protecting her, I could see the flow of letters coiling around her. She, like me, defied the restraints of time. Standing freely in the center of the snowfield.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Above the lines and sentences, only two writers have escaped the rule of time. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, I felt the gaze of a very faintly shining star on the far side of the snowfield.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 And one reader watched it. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I blankly looked up at the sky, then lowered my head to look at Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The stage was set, and what I had to do was clear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are two writers here now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But in the end, what is recorded here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There is only one story."</p>
