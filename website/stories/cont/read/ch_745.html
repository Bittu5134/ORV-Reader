        <article class="orv_main">
            <div class="orv_title"><h1>745 Episode 30 Zodiac (7)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">The &lt;Zodiac&gt; appears often in 'Ways of Survival', and has clashed with Yoo Jonghyuk several times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A representative example is the '137th round'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, in order to talk about what happened in the 137th round, we cannot help but mention the 136th round first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As any reader who has succeeded in re-reading the novel like Killer King more than two times knows this, in the 136th round, Yoo Jonghyuk fights and wins against the 'Dream Eater', an 'Outer God'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>["I have become stronger."」]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">To be precise, it wasn't a proper fight, but a one-sided fight, and Yoo Jonghyuk's psychosis broke out — and that psychosis infected the 'God of the Other World', and he won by luck.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But no matter how you win, a win is a win.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story remains.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'The One Who Murdered a God of The Other World' begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And that was the beginning of the 137th round in question.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' is glaring at incarnation Yoo Jonghyuk.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation tells you to attend the 'Zodiac Ball' if you want to clash with the 'Plague Rat'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a provocation that he would not normally respond to. However, in the 137th round, Yoo Jonghyuk had defeated the 'Dream Eater', a deity from another world, and his liver had come out of his stomach (this is Han Sooyoung's expression), and although he usually did not avoid fights, he did not avoid it even more this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As a result, Yoo Jonghyuk falls into a trap at the 'Zodiac Ball' and is lynched to death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The last thing the dying Yoo Jonghyuk saw was a rabbit stealing his liver and a rat eating his fingernails.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is no way to know whether the 'Nail-Eating Rat' lived under the guise of Yoo Jonghyuk after that, but there is one clear lesson.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "A great-grade constellation is also a constellation." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The final lesson left by Yoo Jonghyuk in the 137th round, where his liver and fingernails were torn off.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 So, if you encounter the true body of the constellation, run away at all costs. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was exactly the advice that is valid for me now.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' is looking into you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A pitch-black shadow covered Zone 13.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At one edge of the shadow, the outline of a tiger was slowly revealed, as if its skin was peeling off.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A height reminiscent of an alpine mountain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Two red eyes hanging from the top of the mountain were observing me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They look as if they are carefully examining whether the product they ordered arrived safely and whether there are any stains or scratches.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a suffocating silence, the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' smiled as if he was satisfied.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Have you finally arrived?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard the voice, I felt very sick to my stomach.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A great-grade constellation is also a constellation. A being who built great stories and became a star in the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And this was the true voice of a 'great-grade constellation'. If you were an ordinary person, the moment you heard it, your head would explode.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason my companions and I were safe was because the stories we had built up so far were not easy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Dokja-ssi, what is that—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">When Kyung Sein opened her mouth, Ye Hyunwoo put a finger to his lips as if to stop her from interfering.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Tiger Who Eats Rice Cake' smiled strangely, as if he was amazed at us.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[My little bean sprout, you have grown a lot during this time.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was an unpleasant expression.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Now it will be about a small section.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Is that a joke from the days of 「Sun and Moon」?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did the frozen companions regain their composure one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed that the newly appeared Zodiac sign had no hostility towards us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's because with the appearance of this guy, the bear beastmen also stopped their activities.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I waited for you for a long time.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I surveyed the atmosphere and tried to say something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"For all the waiting you’ve been waiting for, there hasn’t been any response lately."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A lot of time has passed since I entered the 'Recycling Center'. Meanwhile, I took first place in the 'Zodiac Race', cleared 'The Three Little Pigs', and defeated the Pig Constellation Brothers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But while all these things were happening, 'The Tiger Who Eats Rice Cake' never once cheered for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though this place is the home of the &lt;Zodiac&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, it was a constellation that I believed I had personal exchanges with, so I felt a little disappointed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Above all, I received support for the 'core of the demon race' in the beginning, and I wanted to say thank you if possible—</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Little one, why did you choose Zone 13?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A tone that doesn't seem like joking at all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you think about it, I had always communicated with him through 'indirect messages', so there was no way to know his actual personality.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'The Tiger Who Eats Rice Cake' didn't wait for my answer and shook his head to himself before continuing.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Well, it doesn’t matter. You just have to change the area.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Change areas?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There is no more time to devote to children's play.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The tiger eating rice cake lightly waved its hand in the air as if it was annoyed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then the high portal in the sky swirled, emitting bright light.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Come with me. I will be your sponsor.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It's literally a constellation-like tone and a constellation-like suggestion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth nervously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I already have a sponsor."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though he's  in a moribund state and out of contact, and  is hardly helpful even when he's  not in a moribund state and out of contact, that kind of sponsor is definitely still my sponsor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So I just can't betray him over something like this. I have no intention of betraying him in the future.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The synchronization rate with the sponsor increases.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The tiger twitched his lips as if he was very displeased with that fact.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[That doesn’t matter. Because I want to be your 'supporter', not your 'sponsor'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"What does that mean?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You will be my agent in the next 'Zodiac Scenario'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 'agent' of the following scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know, but what is certain is that the 'Tiger Who Eats Rice Cake' is looking for an incarnation to act on his behalf in the next scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If that were the case, the hilt of the sword was on this side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sorry, but I have a scenario to clear in Zone 13."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[If you come with me, you don’t have to worry about such miscellaneous scenarios.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A system message came from the air along with a humming sound.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' activates the power of the zodiac.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The agent selected by the constellation, 'Tiger' can omit the sub-scenario of the 'Recycling Center'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I had an ominous feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wait for a sec. Are you 'omitting' the scenario I've played so far?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment when a bright beam of light flashed from the tiger's huge right hand.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[No, no, no, no.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A timid mantra was heard from behind. A faint and pale mantra that cannot be believed to be from the same constellation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Go, go, you can't go…!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Rat eating fingernails.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The gaze of the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' that was looking at me moved slowly. The rat that was sticking its head out from behind me hastily lowered its head. The rat's tremors were clearly transmitted through my back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' opened its mouth. His true body, half covered in shadows, flashed white fangs.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The rat was hiding in a place like this.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A mantra full of life. It was hard to breathe, as if my heart had been bitten.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I should have killed him right away. This will be your grave.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stood protecting the 'Nail-Eating Rat'. The eyebrows of the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' arched.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Little one, what are you doing?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The atmosphere was becoming increasingly hostile. I swallowed my saliva as I watched the story slowly boiling over.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, it was not a situation for me, a mere incarnation, to step forward. Because 'Nail-Eating Rat' was also one of the &lt;zodiac signs&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is that it? In the main story, the 'Nail-Eating Rat' was one of the constellations that tormented Kim Dokja and eventually died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, if I remember correctly, at least in this episode, the 'Nail-Eating Rat' was not a bad guy.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 [The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' sponsors you 100 coins.] 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This guy has been rooting for me since the beginning.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 [The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' agrees with incarnation 'Jung Heewon'.] 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There were times when he helped Jung Heewon wake up or lent his hand when I was lacking in probability.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And crucially, he had information that needed to be heard regarding the 'Misreading Association'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Tiger Eating Rice Cake. You probably don’t plan on revealing your status here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Isn’t this enough reason for me to take a little risk?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You probably don’t know who’s here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a wink of my eye, my faithful escort — Lycaon Isparang, the first wolf, appeared.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Step aside, Zodiac.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A presence that brings silence to the area just by uttering a single mantra. Even though he couldn't use his full power because of his contract with me and all he could do was flop around like a wind puppet, he was still a god of another world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsu…</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be honest, I was very grateful just to help with Mantra. This is because uttering this kind of mantra itself was likely burdensome to Lycaon.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' glares at the 'Lost Guide'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' seems to be concerned about Lycaon's presence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lycaon has already defeated the symbol of the pig constellations. Even the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' would not want to take unnecessary risks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At least as far as I know, everyone in the Chinese Zodiac is a coward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was something I didn't know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, in the 137th round of 'Ways of Survival, Yoo Jonghyuk said this.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 When the opponent is the 'weak', the zodiac guys become horribly persistent predators. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Do you think I am a fool?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Surprisingly, the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' seemed completely unfazed by Lycaon's presence.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[If that guy could use his strength, he would have helped you when the bears came.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was the perfect answer.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[In order for the 'Divine God of the Other World' to exist in this low-level scenario, a contract with absurd contents must have been signed. I already know that he can't move.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I never thought everyone would have guessed what the 'Otherworldly Covenant' was about.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your cleverness has been sufficiently proven, so I hope you will stop playing.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, I was surprised.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's not the 'Reclining Dragon,' but is it really the Tiger Eating Rice Cake?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although I was a single-minded man who had no choice but to back down, I responded without losing my composure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even if Lycaon can’t fight, it’s the same. If you really use your power, there will likely be repercussions. If I stop you here—"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[My actions are extremely probable. Didn’t I already tell you?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Tinnitus rang in my head. A story that is still told in real time.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 If you give me a piece of rice cake, I won’t eat it. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did I understand the meaning of this 'story'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I just came to receive my 'rice cake'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With his declaration, a system message came to mind.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have signed a contract with the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You received the 'Demon Core' in return for the contract.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You must attend the 'Zodiac Ball' in return for the 'Demon Core'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I never would have guessed that the promise at that time was replaced in the form of a 'contract'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps this is the ability of the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order to lower my guard, he gave me a much-needed item, but on a condition that seemed relatively trivial.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To hide that this is a 'contract'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Do you understand now, little one?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Now I have to attend the 'Zodiac Ball' without any hesitation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although I felt a bit displeased with suddenly becoming his agent, there was honestly nothing I couldn't do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I leave, will the remaining party members be able to clear the scenario on their own?</p>
