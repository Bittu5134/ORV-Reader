<p>* 5-person dungeon - Donguibogam</p>
<p>* 7-person dungeon - Yongjun&#39;s Jang</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">The group of three, including Kim Dokja, arrived here in the main part of the book, and they chose the &#39;3-person dungeon&#39;, the &#39;Acupuncturists&#39; Field&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, since I was alone, I had no other options.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will choose the one-man dungeon, the Field of Nagak.&quot;</p>
[You enter the 1-person dungeon.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Little information was known about the Field of Nagak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I checked the &#39;Ways of Survival&#39; skill and the notes I had written, but nothing came to mind right away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I can’t help it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time, I have to experience it for myself.</p>
[You are the 5th to enter the single-person dungeon.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time as entering, the &#39;Ever-Changing Stealth Suit&#39; was deactivated. Because from now on, there was no need to make my body smaller.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Nagak&#39;s field was like a huge terrarium that someone artificially decorated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The rocky land rose between the puddles that submerge people up to the chin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hermit crabs about 1 meter tall were also seen creeping and crawling over the land.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Those must be &#39;Nagaks&#39;.</p>
[If you defeat more than 100 &#39;Nagak&#39;, you will be eligible to escape the dungeon.]</p></div>
[Obtain 2 Sangpyeong Tongbo as a basic reward for every 100 Nagak hunts.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In order to enter the &#39;Chapter of the Big Dipper&#39; where the sword of death lies, you must collect 10 Sangpyeong Tongbo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, I have to catch at least 500 Nagaks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I moved slowly, the nagaks who felt my presence turned their antennae all at once.</p>
[The 8th grade sea species &#39;Small Nagak&#39; has noticed your presence!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I still don&#39;t know the attack pattern of these guys.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, I know what kind of instrument a &#39;Nagak&#39; is. A brass instrument made from conch shells.</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to my guess, their attack method is-</p>
[The Nagak Ensemble begins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Ugh, I feel like the air is boiling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I instinctively looked left and right, then took about twenty steps to the left.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And after a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Woo woo woo woo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a deafening roar as if dozens of herds of bison were vomiting at once. I could see the floor on which I had been standing until the moment it was turned into clay with a sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, it was an attack using sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, they did not continue. The monsters stopped crying all at once, probably sucking in their breath to make the sound again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I started hunting them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I approached in an instant and took out &#39;Broken Faith&#39;, the surprised hermit crab tried to defend itself by sticking out a small claw crab.</p>
[The &#39;Blade of Faith&#39; is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, there is no way that an ether blade can be blocked with only a 8th class sea monster&#39;s carapace.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While the Nagak, whose claw had been cut off, vomited a sound, I inserted a new sword into the gap in the Nagak.</p>
[You have hunted 1 &#39;Nagak&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After learning how to hunt one, it was easy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Avoiding the &#39;Nagak ensemble&#39; pouring out at regular intervals, I ran between the conch shells.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Every time I swing the Blade of Faith, one Nagak loses its life.</p>
[You have hunted 23 &#39;Nagaks&#39;.]</p></div>
[You have hunted 24 &#39;Nagaks&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If I feel a little bit out of magic, I bought from the dokkaebi’s bag in advance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I also used an intermediate magic recovery potion.</p>
[You have hunted 152 &#39;Nagaks&#39;.]</p></div>
[You have hunted 153 &#39;Nagaks&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I didn’t forget to look around to see if there were other incarnations around me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There weren’t.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Occasionally I could see gear or clothing dropped by people, but I couldn&#39;t find a living person.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely difficult for a single player dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Defeating hundreds of Nagak and obtaining a notification of the award must be a formidable task for ordinary incarnations.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Demon-like Judge of Fire&#39; rejoices in your growth.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Maritime Admiral&#39; says that he has caught on to his income.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Bald General of Justice&#39; says he heard that the horn meat is good for hair loss and strengthening stamina.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Prisoner of the Golden Headband asks if that&#39;s true.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The messages of the constellations came into my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After defeating the ark at Seoul Station, I felt that the number of constellations permanently residing in the channel increased.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, not everyone in the neighborhood cheered me on, but...</p>
[The constellation &#39;Abyssal Black Flame Dragon&#39; complains that it is not fun because there is no crisis.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In any case, it was around the time that the number of Nagaks I hunted exceeded 400.</p>
[The constellation that has not revealed their modifier warns you that it is not going to be an easy dungeon.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With a somewhat ominous message, a light vibration occurred throughout the terrarium.</p>
[The number of slaughtered &#39;Nagak&#39; in the &#39;Nagak’s Field&#39; has exceeded 400!]</p></div>
[Someone is very angry at the Nagaks’ death!]</p></div>
[Higher seawater species appear!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I saw something rise up in the huge puddle that occupied the center of the &#39;Nagaks’ Field&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a huge conch shell with a height the size of a small house.</p>
[6th sea species, Ancient Nagak has awakened!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s not even 7th grade, it&#39;s suddenly 6th grade?</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this point, if it was a 6th sea species, it was not easy to deal for even Jung Heewon who has activated [Time of Judgment].</p>
<p class="orv_line">A tingling feeling of life was transmitted through the hair on my forearm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Should I run away now?</p>
[Penalty for high-ranking sea species is activated!]</p></div>
[You cannot escape from the dungeon for the next 10 minutes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Unable to escape for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, if I manage to survive for 10 minutes, I can escape.</p>
[A handful of constellations are now licking their lips saying that it will be a little fun.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The ancient Nagak twisted its massive body, and before I knew it, his antennae was pointing toward me.</p>
[6th sea species &#39;Ancient Nagak&#39; has noticed your presence.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I swallowed lightly and thought.</p>
「To what extent can I fight now?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, I wasn&#39;t that weak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I got my first story just before the fourth scenario was over, and I raised my overall ability to the limit of the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is no &#39;Unbreakable Faith&#39;, but there is &#39;Broken Faith&#39; that can be infinitely regenerated with &#39;Thought&#39;, and I can use [white and blue steel]. The &#39;outer suit&#39; obtained in the theater dungeon is still intact.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Bald General of Justice&#39; says that the meat of the Ancient Nagak is in the limelight as a food to prevent hair loss.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Prisoner of the Golden Headband&#39; asks if it&#39;s real.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Bald General of Justice&#39; bets his hair and says it&#39;s real.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Maritime Admiral&#39; says that this &#39;Bald General of Justice&#39;has never eaten Nagaks’ meat.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
[A new bounty scenario has arrived!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Bounty Scenario - Precious Hair&gt;</p>
<p>Classification: Sub</p>
<p>Difficulty: B+</p>
<p>Clear Condition: Hunt the Ancient Nagak and donate the Ancient Nagak to the Prisoner of the Golden Headband.</p>
<p>Time limit: 1 hour.</p>
<p>Reward: 2,000 coins, ???</p>
<p>Failure: —</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">I stared blankly at the newly appeared scenario window and suddenly came to my senses.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was an unexpected opportunity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even a &#39;Bounty Scenario&#39; directly imposed by the Prisoner of the Golden Headband.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it was Kim Dokja, he would never have missed this opportunity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After making a light call, I fixed my &#39;Broken Faith&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Let&#39;s try it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because I already know how to attack Nagaks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Without giving me more time, I ran towards the &#39;Ancient Nagak&#39;. The plan was to activate the &#39;blade of faith&#39; with maximum output immediately, and cut down its skin at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Quadddeuk!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surprisingly, the shell of the 6th grade Sea Species deflected the &#39;Blade of Faith&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Strong enough to block the ether blade. The moment I took a few steps in my panic, I heard an ominous vibration.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;ensemble&#39; of the ancient Nagak is about to begin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly stepped back and searched for a place out of reach of sound waves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A cold sweat ran down my back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel it instinctively. The ensemble of the &#39;Ancient Nagak&#39; had a different attack range than the other Nagaks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see the Ancient Nagak tally swaying as if mocking me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!</p>
<p class="orv_line">A huge circular sound wave was emitted from the Ancient Nagak as the center. I reflexively turned my back and ran away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had to run as far as possible, to a place where those sound waves couldn&#39;t reach.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bubbeobuck!</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the sound was faster than my steps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though I retreated to the point where the sound wave weakened, it felt like I was getting a concussion the moment I got hit. I felt sick to my stomach and felt nauseous. In the distance, I saw two Ancient Nagaks swaying.</p>
[Exclusive skill &#39;Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World&#39; is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This time, Ways of Survival was activated just in time.</p>
「&quot;There’s an easy way to hunt ancient nagak.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Those were the words of Yoo Jonghyuk, without a doubt, another sentence of &#39;Ways of Survival&#39; came to mind next.</p>
「&quot;You can&#39;t avoid his ensemble attack even if you cover your ears.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I already know. I just had my ears covered.</p>
「&quot;The attack method is simple.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, our regressor protagonist seemed to know the strategy of hunting an &#39;Ancient Nagak&#39;.</p>
「&quot;Just before he opens his mouth for an ensemble.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Before opening its mouth?</p>
「&quot;Run faster than the speed of sound and cut it in half with a powerful punch.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Did I hear it wrong?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I rolled on the floor mindlessly avoiding the &#39;Nagak’s Ensemble&#39;.</p>
「&quot;There is an easier way.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, that was not the end of Yoo Jonghyuk’s words.</p>
「&quot;All you have to do is hit its shell with the [Pacheonbuk Fist] that has reached its climax. No matter how hard the shell is, it can&#39;t handle the impact of the mesosphere.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk’s unlucky smile came to life before my eyes.</p>
「&quot;It’s a basic strategy that anyone can do.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I can understand why Kim Dokja hit Yoo Jonghyuk in the back of the head at every opportunity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I came to my senses, I was surrounded by miniature Nagaks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is no place to avoid the next attack.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, the second ensemble of &#39;Ancient Nagak&#39; was about to begin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What should i do?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Can I use the &#39;Shield of Hercules&#39;? [Air Area Defense] works against sword attacks. Can I defend?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Or not-</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This way.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A human voice came from somewhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned my head, a small hand was fidgeting between the shells of the &#39;Nagak&#39; from a few steps away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The owner of the hand raised the shell while walking, and poked her head out through a small gap.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Here. Come in here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I checked the child&#39;s face, I felt like my heart stopped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why is this child here?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk’s voice echoed in my head.</p>
「&quot;Of course, I don’t bother to get my hands dirty hunting something like &#39;Nagaks&#39;.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, the ancient trumpets of horns resounded, and the wind blew the wavy hair of the child.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Brilliant light brown hair.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a child I knew well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ahjussi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fifth member of &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; I met.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first incarnation of the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Quickly. Come in!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A child who will go through the most terrible things in this 41st turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An incarnation that finally becomes a disaster in another world line.</p>
「&quot;Take care of it, Beast Lord.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Disaster of Floods—Shin Yoosoung was there.</p>
