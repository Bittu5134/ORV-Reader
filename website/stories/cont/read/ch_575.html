<p class="orv_line">We stood side by side, holding on to one of the thorns.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You can't pass out!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't worry!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said, but I wasn't sure if my physical strength would hold up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Normally, I would have used my 'Elaine Forest Essence' to heal my wounds and get moving, but</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was in a hurry now that I'd lost [Purest Sword Force].</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sooner I could get out of here and get the other hidden pieces, the safer I would be.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Especially if this world is the one I think.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What happened to Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi? I need to tell them about the 'Yoo</p>
<p class="orv_line">Joonghyuk' I saw as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My eyelids kept dropping.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know how many times I blacked out and woke up again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wake up!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon pinched my waist with her left arm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ichthyosaur's movements had slowed down. The crimson-colored stomach walls had turned</p>
<p class="orv_line">almost grayish white.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I think it's done. Just a little more to go......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that something unexpected happened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I heard a sound like a wind leak from somewhere, and a large, sharp set of teeth appeared, slicing</p>
<p class="orv_line">through the guts from the outside.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I instinctively screamed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hold your breath!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The black river rushed in through the cracks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We clung to each other's arms and were swept away into the Han River.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[An error has occurred in the hidden scenario.]</p></div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">[The hidden scenario was partially completed.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something attacked the ichthyosaur, targeting the 'stomach'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The gut of the torn ichthyosaur scattered in the dark river. Through the swirling blood, two</p>
<p class="orv_line">hideous eyes glared at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A monster twice as large as the one that had devoured us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I recognized it immediately.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ichthyosaur that swallowed Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sea-commander.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart sank as I saw the sea commander charging to devour us and Jung Heewon's horrified</p>
<p class="orv_line">expression.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Jung Heewon is going to die.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">From the first scenario to being eaten by the ichthyosaur, what I did ran through my head like a</p>
<p class="orv_line">movie.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How I had changed the story with the arrogance of writing the original.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shouldn't have rehabilitated the Cheoldoo Group.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shouldn't have gone out looking for Kim Dokja or Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Are you really Cheon Inho?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It would have been better if I had been killed by Jung Heewon while pretending to be a villain</p>
<p class="orv_line">like in the original novel. Then she would have awakened safely as the 'Judge of Destruction'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She would have survived.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I began to untie the knot on my right arm with my teeth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon looked back at me in horror.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I finished, I felt rather at peace.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「This is a fitting end for the villain Cheon Inho.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My body slowly sank beneath the water, along with the loose knot.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bubbles of air flowed out of Jung Heewon's mouth as she shouted something at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw the sea commander opening his mouth at me and Jung Heewon reaching for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In my fading consciousness, I heard the tick, tick, tick of time stopping.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new day has begun.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your creativity has been recharged.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I realized what was about to happen.</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill '⬜⬜' is activated!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have entered the 'Snowfield'.]</p></div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the blank space in front of me, a bitter laugh escaped from his dwindling</p>
<p class="orv_line">consciousness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn it. I'm supposed to write until I die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">+]</p>
<p class="orv_line"># Jung Heewon's Awakening</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜</p>
<p class="orv_line">* At your current skill level, you can write a total of 180 additional characters.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p><!>[You can stay in the 'Snowfield' for a total of 4 minutes.]</p>
<p>I looked at the first sentence of the blank line.</p>
<p><&>「Jung Heewon.」</p>
<p>I wonder if it's okay if I keep writing.</p>
<p><!>[There are 3 minutes remaining.]</p>
<p>For some reason, I was not confident. Something was different from Kim Cheolyang and Bang</p>
<p>Cheolsoo.</p>
<p>I remembered how I felt as a child when I received my first manuscript.</p>
<p>As I looked at the vague blank page, I naturally remembered the snowy landscape I saw with</p>
<p>Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>In my dream, Kim Dokja said.</p>
<p><&>「It's dazzling.」</p>
<p>He said.</p>
<p><&>「Anything can become a reality in this place.」</p>
<p>It snowed heavily from the sky, and we lay side by side in the snow and looked back at the</p>
<p>footprints we walked together. Before I knew it, the footprints were hard to see.</p>
<p><&>「Because no one remembers what they were.」</p>
<p>I don't remember if he said that.</p>
<p>But the spot where I laid with Kim Dokja was strangely comfortable and warm. If I could, I</p>
<p>wanted to stay there forever, curled up in a tight ball and writing nothing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I couldn't.</p>
<p>Because I am a writer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>「Jung Heewon remembered that day」</p>
<p>If I don't write, I can't live.</p>
<p><&>「for the first time in a long time.」</p>
<p>So I wrote the sentence.</p>
<p>I chose words like I would choose clothes for Jung Heewon, and I chose endings like I would</p>
<p>choose shoes for her.</p>
<p>I imagined her wearing those shoes, walking down a road that no one remembers.</p>

<p>I thought, my mouth open in disbelief.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><!>[Successfully recreating the scene.]</p>
<p><!>[Leaving the 'Snowfield'.]</p>
<p></p>
<p>Time began to pass again. My breathing unraveled, and weak bubbles escaped my mouth.</p>
<p>I didn't write about whether I would survive; there was no room for that.</p>
<p>But I did write at least one thing for sure.</p>
<p><&>「Jung Heewon remembered that day for the first time in a long time.」</p>
<p>That you, who live this story, will surely survive.</p>
<p><&>「'Heewon, you're too aggressive. This is a sport. You can't really hurt your opponent.'」</p>
<p>you continue like this, I won't be able to keep protecting you.'」</p>
<p>A pure white light emanated from Jung Heewon's body.</p>
<p>opponents?」</p>
<p>Kim Dokja once said. He said that he likes the moment a character's attribute blossoms the most.</p>
<p><&>「Isn't it more strange if you don't get hurt while fighting with a sword?」</p>
<p>Now I agree with Kim Dokja.</p>
<p><!>[The attribute of the character 'Jung Heewon' is blossoming.]</p>
<p>I couldn't put it any other way.</p>
<p>The figure of Jung Heewon, who is now cutting through the tide and approaching, is truly</p>
<p>dazzling.</p>
<p>Her hot hands grabbed my hands strongly. I felt my body being firmly anchored.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon looked back at the sea commander as she clutched the ground rat knife.</p>
<p>Riding the rapids, she swooped toward the sea commander as if she had wings.</p>
<p><!>[The character 'Jung Heewon' has used 'Kendo Lv.3'!]</p>
<p><!>[The character 'Jung Heewon' has used 'Demon Slaying Lv.2'!]</p>
<p>No matter how strong Jung Heewon is, she can't defeat a sea commander with just [Kendo] and</p>
<p>But I wrote that it is possible. So it should be possible.</p>
<p>It will be possible.</p>
<p><&>「Jung Heewon wanted to ask the couch.」</p>
<p>It is possible.</p>
<p><&>「'Is it okay to kill this thing?'」</p>
<p>In my fading consciousness, the words were slurred.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Somewhere in the distance, I could hear Jung Heewon's shout.</p>
<p><&>「The dormant senses in her soul were awakening.」</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the ground rat sword broke through the spray and plunged into the sea</p>
<p>commander's left eye. The bleeding sea commander howled wildly.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon didn't stop and pulled the thorn from my waistband. The sea commander's tail cut</p>
<p>through the water and grazed her waist.</p>
<p>The enormous impact jolted the view.</p>
<p>She squinted her bloodshot eyes, clutched me tightly with one arm, and drove the thorn into the</p>
<p>ichthyosaur's tail.</p>
<p><&>「'This is not a sport.'」</p>
<p>That was a sentence I didn't write.</p>
<p><&>「'If I don't kill this monster, someone else will die.'」</p>
<p><!>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier agrees with incarnation 'Jung Heewon's will.]</p>
<p>And a message came from somewhere.</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating-Rat' agrees with incarnation 'Jung Heewon's will.]</p>
<p>The light emanating from her body grew stronger and stronger.</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' agrees with incarnation 'Jung Heewon's will.]</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' agrees with incarnation 'Jung Heewon's will.]</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Pig Living in a Brick House' agrees with incarnation 'Jung Heewon's will.]</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Primordial Cow' agrees with incarnation 'Jung Heewon's will.]</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' agrees with incarnation 'Jung Heewon's will.]</p>
<p>.......</p>
<p>I felt an invisible Libra tilting.</p>
<p><!>[All constellations in the channel agree to the use of the skill.]</p>
<p><!>['Hour of Judgment' has been activated.]</p>
<p>Hour of Judgment.</p>
<p>A skill that grants invincibility when activated against the wicked.</p>
<p>However, the enemy in front of us was a monster.</p>
<p><!>[The attribute of the character 'Jung Heewon' has blossomed to 'Demon Slaying Judge (Hero)'.]</p>
<p>With a dazzling flash of light, a blood-colored aura enveloped Jung Heewon's body.</p>
<p>Demon Slaying (滅魔) Judge.</p>
<p>Surely, there was such an attribute. It was one of the three great judges' attributes, but it hadn't</p>
<p></p>
<p>appeared in the main story.</p>
<p>It wasn't a class that specialized in hand-to-hand combat like the Judge of Destruction, but it was</p>
<p>an indestructible hero class that increased its combat power many times against monsters.</p>
<p><!>[You have contributed greatly to the blossoming of the attribute 'Crouching Figure'!]</p>
<p><!>[The character 'Jung Heewon' won't hesitate to be your sword in the future.]</p>
<p>With an eerie trajectory, the thorn moved forward and stabbed the sea commander's body.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon stabbed and stabbed and stabbed at the sea commander like a madman. From the</p>
<p>tail, to the body, to the neck, to the crown.</p>
<p>When she finally stabbed the second eye, it jerked as if it had been electrocuted, and then went</p>
<p>limp.</p>
<p>Its lifeless body floated to the surface of the Han River.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, with me on her back, soared into the sky on the back of the sea commander.</p>
<p>Along with the rushing river, I could see the ruined city of Seoul.</p>
<p>Smoke rising from everywhere. Collapsed buildings, and the indifferent moon hanging over the</p>
<p>ruins of civilization.</p>
<p>The destruction I wrote became the landscape.</p>
<p><&>「'Dazzling.'」</p>
<p>Looking at the landscape of the end of the world as we knew it, Jung Heewon was thinking the</p>
<p>same thing I was.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was the landscape that Kim Dokja and Jung Heewon shared.</p>
<p><!>['Hour of Judgment' has ended.]</p>
<p>And now I was looking at that astounding world with her.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, who had landed on the ground with me on her back, fell forward.</p>
<p>In the distance, I could see a poisonous mist rolling in.</p>
<p>I tied another knot in her arm, then dragged her to the basement of a nearby building to hide.</p>
<p><!>[You have bought 2 'Elaine Monkey's Lungs'.]</p>
<p>I popped a lung into Jung Heewon's mouth, and I popped a lung into mine.</p>
<p>Starlight streamed in from the basement window. It was a little cold, and strangely, my heart</p>
<p>didn't stop pounding.</p>
<p>The night of destruction was long.</p>
<p>I looked at Jung Heewon as she slept and thought long and hard about the lies I had written and</p>
<p>would write in the future.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On the Han River, in the solitary moonlight.</p>
<p>The dead sea commander's stomach lurched several times, and then a figure crawled out of the</p>
<p>faded scales.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Ha, I almost died. Really."</p>
<p>She brushed the blood off her coat and looked around, sighing softly.</p>
<p>"That's the first time I've ever had a scenario stolen from me, by the way. What an asshole."</p>
<p>But there was no one to hear her.</p>
<p>Well, there was one.</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' chuckles and says this place is a bit unusual.]</p>
<p>"What are you laughing at, dude. Why do you have that modifier?"</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' asks what's wrong with his modifier.]</p>
<p>"What about the others?"</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' says not yet.]</p>
<p>She pursed her lips lightly, as if in disbelief, and sighed deeply again.</p>
<p>After a moment, she looked up, an odd smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>"Well, it's my first scenario in a long time."</p>
<p>Her eyes sparkled intensely for a moment as she stared off into space, searching for a star</p>
<p>somewhere in the night sky.</p>
<p>"I'm going to live for myself first."</p>
