<p class="orv_line">We stood side by side, holding on to one of the thorns.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You can&#x27;t pass out!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#x27;t worry!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if my physical strength would hold up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Normally, I would have used my &#x27;Elaine Forest Essence&#x27; to heal my wounds and get moving, but</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was in a hurry now that I&#x27;d lost [Purest Sword Force].</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sooner I could get out of here and get the other hidden pieces, the safer I would be.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Especially if this world is the one I think.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What happened to Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi? I need to tell them about the &#x27;Yoo</p>
<p class="orv_line">Joonghyuk&#x27; I saw as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My eyelids kept dropping.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know how many times I blacked out and woke up again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wake up!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon pinched my waist with her left arm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ichthyosaur&#x27;s movements had slowed down. The crimson-colored stomach walls had turned</p>
<p class="orv_line">almost grayish white.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think it&#x27;s done. Just a little more to go.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that something unexpected happened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I heard a sound like a wind leak from somewhere, and a large, sharp set of teeth appeared, slicing</p>
<p class="orv_line">through the guts from the outside.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I instinctively screamed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hold your breath!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The black river rushed in through the cracks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We clung to each other&#x27;s arms and were swept away into the Han River.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[An error has occurred in the hidden scenario.]</div>[An error has occurred in the hidden scenario.]</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">[The hidden scenario was partially completed.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something attacked the ichthyosaur, targeting the &#x27;stomach&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The gut of the torn ichthyosaur scattered in the dark river. Through the swirling blood, two</p>
<p class="orv_line">hideous eyes glared at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A monster twice as large as the one that had devoured us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I recognized it immediately.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ichthyosaur that swallowed Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sea-commander.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart sank as I saw the sea commander charging to devour us and Jung Heewon&#x27;s horrified</p>
<p class="orv_line">expression.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Jung Heewon is going to die.」</div>「Jung Heewon is going to die.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">From the first scenario to being eaten by the ichthyosaur, what I did ran through my head like a</p>
<p class="orv_line">movie.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Looking at the blank space in front of me, a bitter laugh escaped from his dwindling</p>
<p class="orv_line">consciousness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn it. I&#x27;m supposed to write until I die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">+]</p>
<p class="orv_line"># Jung Heewon&#x27;s Awakening</p>

<p class="orv_line">⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜</p>
<p class="orv_line">* At your current skill level, you can write a total of 180 additional characters.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;!&gt;[You can stay in the &#x27;Snowfield&#x27; for a total of 4 minutes.]</p>
<p>I looked at the first sentence of the blank line.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「Jung Heewon.」</p>
<p>I wonder if it&#x27;s okay if I keep writing.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[There are 3 minutes remaining.]</p>
<p>For some reason, I was not confident. Something was different from Kim Cheolyang and Bang</p>
<p>Cheolsoo.</p>
<p>I remembered how I felt as a child when I received my first manuscript.</p>
<p>As I looked at the vague blank page, I naturally remembered the snowy landscape I saw with</p>
<p>Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>In my dream, Kim Dokja said.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「It&#x27;s dazzling.」</p>
<p>He said.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「Anything can become a reality in this place.」</p>
<p>It snowed heavily from the sky, and we lay side by side in the snow and looked back at the</p>
<p>footprints we walked together. Before I knew it, the footprints were hard to see.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「Because no one remembers what they were.」</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t remember if he said that.</p>
<p>But the spot where I laid with Kim Dokja was strangely comfortable and warm. If I could, I</p>
<p>wanted to stay there forever, curled up in a tight ball and writing nothing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I couldn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>Because I am a writer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>「Jung Heewon remembered that day」</p>
<p>If I don&#x27;t write, I can&#x27;t live.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「for the first time in a long time.」</p>
<p>So I wrote the sentence.</p>
<p>I chose words like I would choose clothes for Jung Heewon, and I chose endings like I would</p>
<p>choose shoes for her.</p>
<p>I imagined her wearing those shoes, walking down a road that no one remembers.</p>

<p>&lt;!&gt;[You can write an additional 160 characters.]</p>
<p>I continued to write sentence after sentence.</p>
<p>Would these lies I wrote save her life.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>But I had to try everything I could.</p>

<p>I thought, my mouth open in disbelief.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Successfully recreating the scene.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Leaving the &#x27;Snowfield&#x27;.]</p>
<p></p>
<p>Time began to pass again. My breathing unraveled, and weak bubbles escaped my mouth.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t write about whether I would survive; there was no room for that.</p>
<p>But I did write at least one thing for sure.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「Jung Heewon remembered that day for the first time in a long time.」</p>
<p>That you, who live this story, will surely survive.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「&#x27;Heewon, you&#x27;re too aggressive. This is a sport. You can&#x27;t really hurt your opponent.&#x27;」</p>
<p>you continue like this, I won&#x27;t be able to keep protecting you.&#x27;」</p>
<p>A pure white light emanated from Jung Heewon&#x27;s body.</p>
<p>opponents?」</p>
<p>Kim Dokja once said. He said that he likes the moment a character&#x27;s attribute blossoms the most.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「Isn&#x27;t it more strange if you don&#x27;t get hurt while fighting with a sword?」</p>
<p>Now I agree with Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The attribute of the character &#x27;Jung Heewon&#x27; is blossoming.]</p>
<p>I couldn&#x27;t put it any other way.</p>
<p>The figure of Jung Heewon, who is now cutting through the tide and approaching, is truly</p>
<p>dazzling.</p>
<p>Her hot hands grabbed my hands strongly. I felt my body being firmly anchored.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon looked back at the sea commander as she clutched the ground rat knife.</p>
<p>Riding the rapids, she swooped toward the sea commander as if she had wings.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The character &#x27;Jung Heewon&#x27; has used &#x27;Kendo Lv.3&#x27;!]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The character &#x27;Jung Heewon&#x27; has used &#x27;Demon Slaying Lv.2&#x27;!]</p>
<p>No matter how strong Jung Heewon is, she can&#x27;t defeat a sea commander with just [Kendo] and</p>
<p>But I wrote that it is possible. So it should be possible.</p>
<p>It will be possible.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「Jung Heewon wanted to ask the couch.」</p>
<p>It is possible.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「&#x27;Is it okay to kill this thing?&#x27;」</p>
<p>In my fading consciousness, the words were slurred.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Somewhere in the distance, I could hear Jung Heewon&#x27;s shout.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「The dormant senses in her soul were awakening.」</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the ground rat sword broke through the spray and plunged into the sea</p>
<p>commander&#x27;s left eye. The bleeding sea commander howled wildly.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon didn&#x27;t stop and pulled the thorn from my waistband. The sea commander&#x27;s tail cut</p>
<p>through the water and grazed her waist.</p>
<p>The enormous impact jolted the view.</p>
<p>She squinted her bloodshot eyes, clutched me tightly with one arm, and drove the thorn into the</p>
<p>ichthyosaur&#x27;s tail.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「&#x27;This is not a sport.&#x27;」</p>
<p>That was a sentence I didn&#x27;t write.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「&#x27;If I don&#x27;t kill this monster, someone else will die.&#x27;」</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[A constellation who hasn&#x27;t revealed their modifier agrees with incarnation &#x27;Jung Heewon&#x27;s will.]</p>
<p>And a message came from somewhere.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#x27;Nail-Eating-Rat&#x27; agrees with incarnation &#x27;Jung Heewon&#x27;s will.]</p>
<p>The light emanating from her body grew stronger and stronger.</p>

<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#x27;Sneaking Schemer&#x27; agrees with incarnation &#x27;Jung Heewon&#x27;s will.]</p>
<p>.......</p>
<p>I felt an invisible Libra tilting.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[All constellations in the channel agree to the use of the skill.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[&#x27;Hour of Judgment&#x27; has been activated.]</p>
<p>Hour of Judgment.</p>
<p>A skill that grants invincibility when activated against the wicked.</p>
<p>However, the enemy in front of us was a monster.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The attribute of the character &#x27;Jung Heewon&#x27; has blossomed to &#x27;Demon Slaying Judge (Hero)&#x27;.]</p>
<p>With a dazzling flash of light, a blood-colored aura enveloped Jung Heewon&#x27;s body.</p>
<p>Demon Slaying (滅魔) Judge.</p>
<p>Surely, there was such an attribute. It was one of the three great judges&#x27; attributes, but it hadn&#x27;t</p>
<p></p>
<p>appeared in the main story.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t a class that specialized in hand-to-hand combat like the Judge of Destruction, but it was</p>
<p>an indestructible hero class that increased its combat power many times against monsters.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[You have contributed greatly to the blossoming of the attribute &#x27;Crouching Figure&#x27;!]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The character &#x27;Jung Heewon&#x27; won&#x27;t hesitate to be your sword in the future.]</p>
<p>With an eerie trajectory, the thorn moved forward and stabbed the sea commander&#x27;s body.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon stabbed and stabbed and stabbed at the sea commander like a madman. From the</p>
<p>tail, to the body, to the neck, to the crown.</p>
<p>When she finally stabbed the second eye, it jerked as if it had been electrocuted, and then went</p>
<p>limp.</p>
<p>Its lifeless body floated to the surface of the Han River.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, with me on her back, soared into the sky on the back of the sea commander.</p>
<p>Along with the rushing river, I could see the ruined city of Seoul.</p>
<p>Smoke rising from everywhere. Collapsed buildings, and the indifferent moon hanging over the</p>
<p>ruins of civilization.</p>
<p>The destruction I wrote became the landscape.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「&#x27;Dazzling.&#x27;」</p>
<p>Looking at the landscape of the end of the world as we knew it, Jung Heewon was thinking the</p>
<p>same thing I was.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was the landscape that Kim Dokja and Jung Heewon shared.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[&#x27;Hour of Judgment&#x27; has ended.]</p>
<p>And now I was looking at that astounding world with her.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, who had landed on the ground with me on her back, fell forward.</p>
<p>In the distance, I could see a poisonous mist rolling in.</p>
<p>I tied another knot in her arm, then dragged her to the basement of a nearby building to hide.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[You have bought 2 &#x27;Elaine Monkey&#x27;s Lungs&#x27;.]</p>
<p>I popped a lung into Jung Heewon&#x27;s mouth, and I popped a lung into mine.</p>
<p>Starlight streamed in from the basement window. It was a little cold, and strangely, my heart</p>
<p>didn&#x27;t stop pounding.</p>
<p>The night of destruction was long.</p>
<p>I looked at Jung Heewon as she slept and thought long and hard about the lies I had written and</p>
<p>would write in the future.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On the Han River, in the solitary moonlight.</p>
<p>The dead sea commander&#x27;s stomach lurched several times, and then a figure crawled out of the</p>
<p>faded scales.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;Ha, I almost died. Really.&quot;</p>
<p>She brushed the blood off her coat and looked around, sighing softly.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever had a scenario stolen from me, by the way. What an asshole.&quot;</p>
<p>But there was no one to hear her.</p>
<p>Well, there was one.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#x27;Sneaking Schemer&#x27; chuckles and says this place is a bit unusual.]</p>
<p>&quot;What are you laughing at, dude. Why do you have that modifier?&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#x27;Sneaking Schemer&#x27; asks what&#x27;s wrong with his modifier.]</p>
<p>&quot;What about the others?&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#x27;Sneaking Schemer&#x27; says not yet.]</p>
<p>She pursed her lips lightly, as if in disbelief, and sighed deeply again.</p>
<p>After a moment, she looked up, an odd smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it&#x27;s my first scenario in a long time.&quot;</p>
<p>Her eyes sparkled intensely for a moment as she stared off into space, searching for a star</p>
<p>somewhere in the night sky.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m going to live for myself first.&quot;</p>
