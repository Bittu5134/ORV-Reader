<p class="orv_line">We were locked up in Namgung Sega&#39;s Brain Jade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be honest, I wondered if it made sense to lock us up for badmouthing their own dumplings, but the group called Odae Sega was no ordinary group.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as we entered Brain Jade, the first thing that greeted us were the existing prisoners.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hahaha, it looks like another newcomer has come in.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">From the big bosses of the Gumurim generation to the criminals of the Shinmurim. The prisoners who found Yoo Jonghyuk were glued to the bars and licking their lips.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What a soft little brat.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You were unlucky, brat. Your life is obvious now that you&#39;ve come this far.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What a chubby little brat, should I boil it or roast it—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk looked at the prisoners with indifferent eyes and then picked out the two men who seemed to be the best among them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;In-soo Electrode. Na-tae-geom Lee Cheol-gun.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The men who had been called by nicknames by Yoo Jonghyuk opened their eyes wide and muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh, how did our nicknames…?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You will die in the &#39;Terror Expedition&#39; in 28 days.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A sudden silence spread through the prison at Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s death curse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A middle-aged man who had been locked up in the opposite prison woke up belatedly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You bratty brat, you&#39;ve really lost your mind!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Baeksalgeom Mahyung.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Baeksalgeom Mahyung, whose name had been called, glared at Yoo Joonghyuk with his eyes wide open.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk looked at him for a moment and then declared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You will die now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What? Keuhahaha—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Baeksalgeom Mahyung laughed for a long time, saying &quot;Keuhahahaha,&quot; as if he had heard a lame joke. And after a while, Mahyung grabbed his heart, knelt down, vomited blood, and died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wh, what&#39;s going on! What the heck!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Mahyung?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What happened? Are you kidding me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Guard, where is the guard!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A while later, a guard who had been hurriedly dispatched confirmed the death of Baeksalgeom Mahyung. It was a heart attack of unknown cause.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If there&#39;s anyone else who wants to know their lifespan, come out.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With that, the prisoners&#39; mockery disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked inwardly, amazed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—How did you do it? Did you kill him with a skill?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I just saw a guy who was about to die. That&#39;s all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 41st round’s regressor. He&#39;s scary.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, not everyone thought Yoo Jonghyuk was scary.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you really the disciple of Breaking the Sky Sword Saint? You&#39;re so amazing.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guards seemed to find Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s talent amazing and did not spare their praise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you really foresee Mahyung&#39;s death? I heard that even Breaking the Sky Sword Saint had the power of foresight...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;By the way, he really is a handsome kid.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the guards who couldn&#39;t stop admiring Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s appearance, I remembered reading a study that said that &#39;good-looking prisoners&#39; were more likely to receive a lighter sentence in the courtroom.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Just hold on here for a bit. Food will be served on time. The food in our brain prison is better than you think.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#39;t worry too much. If you just apologize well, the lord will soon release you. Namgung Sega isn&#39;t that vulgar.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Isn&#39;t this guy Yoo Jonghyuk just living his life in easy mode because he&#39;s handsome?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well, anyway.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Alright. Since we&#39;ve come this far, we should be safe today.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just in case, I tried using the story fragment 「A Bird Listening to Daytime Talk」 again, but I didn&#39;t detect any beings watching us like before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Namgung Sega has a few masters who have reached transcendence, and there are also incarnations that appear in higher scenarios.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even this brain prison is designed so that even the most high-ranking constellations can&#39;t easily enter and exit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As long as we&#39;re in the martial arts world, it&#39;s hard to find a safer place than this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took advantage of the absence of guards to quietly release &#39;Thoughts&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You&#39;re doing something dangerous.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—There&#39;s no choice. There&#39;s a time limit for transformation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although there were suddenly two prisoners in the cramped cell, I couldn&#39;t maintain &#39;Thoughts&#39; forever.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And I had a plan in case I got caught.</p>
[Item &#39;Deodorizing Spray&#39; was used.]</p></div>
[Item &#39;Travel Bed&#39; was used.]</p></div>
[Item &#39;Someone&#39;s Old Blanket&#39; was used.]</p></div>
[Hidden item combination completed.]</p></div>
[Special option &#39;It&#39;s Dangerous Outside the Blanket&#39; is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a &#39;Honeymoon Item&#39; combination that Kim Dokja had told me about some time ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The completed blanket tent naturally blended into the background of the prison.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I warned Yoo Jonghyuk, who was looking at me with a dumbfounded look.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Don&#39;t talk to me, I&#39;m going to do something important from now on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I curled up in the blanket and immediately turned on Kim Dokja&#39;s sacred relic, the smartphone.</p>
「Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World.」</p></div>
[There is an unopened &#39;bookmark&#39; in the file.]</p></div>
[Would you like to move to the bookmarked page?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, there was a bookmark marked by the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It must be a page with information necessary for the current situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Flipping through the pages, I checked the tasks that were currently facing me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One, find a way to repair the incarnation body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I don’t repair the incarnation body within three days, I will die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Two, enter the new main scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I repair the incarnation body, if I don’t enter the &#39;main scenario&#39; and escape my status as an exile, I will still die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, I could somehow find a solution to these two tasks if I just met &#39;Breaking the Sky Sword Saint&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was the third.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Three, find &#39;the second Kim Dokja&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;The second Kim Dokja&#39; is somewhere in this universe. However, for some reason, contact has been lost.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, the Demon King of Salvation knew the last location where &#39;the second Kim Dokja&#39; was detected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was that the &#39;entrances&#39; to that location in this &lt;Star Stream&gt; were extremely limited.</p>
「Read the 999th round. You’ll probably be able to get help.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly turned the page while checking the note left by the Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and I couldn’t leave to meet the second Kim Dokja right away. For now, the best thing to do was to reread the given &#39;Ways of Survival&#39; and check the roadmap.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I calmly began reading &#39;Ways of Survival&#39; sentence by sentence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew that the length of one &#39;Ways of Survival&#39; was strangely long, but I was surprised once again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This kind of writing is not in the right mind of the writer or the reader.</p>
「The items that can be obtained in &#39;First Murim&#39; are as follows.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Sentences that were so boring that even someone who was stuck on a deserted island and had nothing left to read would probably hesitate.</p>
「How to obtain the Book of Extermination’s Martial Arts…」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Excessively extensive settings and detailed descriptions.</p>
「So the Transcendent Seats finally decide to elect the &#39;King of the Transcendent Seats&#39;.」</p></div>
「The basic materials for producing the Dark Moon Theater are as follows.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As I read the dry sentences, I couldn&#39;t help but think about the person who pressed down on each and every word of those sentences.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung really wanted to save Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Is that important?</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I raised my head, little Yoo Jonghyuk, who had lifted the blanket, was looking down at me as if I was pitiful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It is important.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—What are you doing?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a moment and decided to be honest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I&#39;m reading a novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought there would definitely be sharp criticism, but unexpectedly Yoo Jonghyuk sighed quietly and sat down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You should get some rest too. There aren&#39;t many times when we can rest comfortably like now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk started his morning meal while being greeted by the moonlight seeping through the bars of the prison. I thought he was a bit weird because he said resting was like eating breakfast, but even that was typical of Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a situation where it wouldn’t be strange if he died tomorrow, one person ate breakfast and the other read a novel.</p>
「When does the captain rest?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was the scene where Lee Hyunsung asked Yoo Jonghyuk in the 999th round.</p>
「When the old dream stops.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I thought while watching Yoo Jonghyuk who was constantly working hard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will he, who was born as &#39;Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;, really be allowed to have a proper rest? Will his old dream finally end when he reaches the end of this forgotten world line?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe Kim Dokja or Han Sooyoung don’t know either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a sense, the 41st round is just being written.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What we can anticipate right now is not the distant future, but tomorrow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That beating must hurt a lot.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The next day, Yoo Jonghyuk wasn’t beaten. He was even released from the prison.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had an ominous feeling. Could it be that the Emperor Sword Namgung Jincheon was trying to make Yoo Jonghyuk’s insults disappear?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If that’s the case, then all the plans I’ve made so far will be in vain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">More than anything, if Namgung Se goes out, our safety will not be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Treat him with utmost respect. He is an honored guest.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">While being guided by the servants, I had no idea how the situation was going.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did he go from being a prisoner  to a VIP overnight?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Did Breaking the Sky Sword Saint come visit?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I didn’t get that feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Breaking the Sky Sword Saint didn’t even come, but the way we were treated changed?</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was a situation where anyone could see that there was an ulterior motive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Your plan seems to have been successful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I don’t know if I should call this a success.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The VIP room of Namgung Se, where only the elders of the Gupaebang and the famous masters of Murim can stay.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Foods prepared by trained masters were being arranged on the table in front of me. Every time I think of Murim, I only think of chicken soup, noodles, and Murim dumplings, but I was surprised that there were so many foods.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dongpa pork and Ojangyuk that melted in your mouth. And even Peking duck.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since I was a dwarf with &#39;thoughts&#39;, I couldn&#39;t eat all these foods to my heart&#39;s content, which was a shame.</p>
<p class="orv_line">On the other hand, Yoo Jonghyuk was eating well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—But can you eat that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—What?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You don&#39;t eat food made by others.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk, who had stuffed his cheeks with food, glared at me with an expression that said, &quot;What nonsense are you talking about?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Oh, you idiot.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did you forget that you couldn&#39;t eat &#39;food made by others&#39;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—No, just eat a lot.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it was better. Also, in that situation, he would have had to eat dirt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The situation was a bit strange, but it wasn&#39;t easy to find a situation where he could eat his fill and rest comfortably.</p>
[The story fragment &#39;The Man Who Eats Eight Meals a Day&#39; begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The story fragment seemed to be intrigued as well, encouraging Yoo Jonghyuk to binge eat. While watching little Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s stomach swell in real time, I also occasionally picked up some food to eat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A whole day passed while we enjoyed eight meals, including breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Breaking the Sky Sword Saint did not come to find us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead, it was Jewanggeom Namgungjin who came to find us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It feels good to see the boy eating well.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Namgung Jincheon, who came with his characteristically good-natured smile, nodded his head in satisfaction as he looked at Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s chubby cheeks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It really hurt when the boy spat out our dumplings.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They were trash.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I admit it. It didn&#39;t bring out the true taste of Murim dumplings.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unexpectedly, Namgung Jincheon readily admitted it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since ancient times, in Murim, you have to be careful when your opponent is humble. That means they clearly want something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is the boy really a disciple of &#39;Breaking the Sky Sword Saint&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If so?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Can you prove it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk rolled up his chopsticks as I had mentioned before and slowly recreated the first move of [Breaking the Sky Sword Saint].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was it because it was a first move swung by a kid with no magical power and a chubby belly? It looked like a swordsmanship that wouldn&#39;t even break a rice bowl, let alone the sky. Wait a minute.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did this human forget [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship]?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#39;t reveal that martial arts to the outside world. It&#39;ll definitely cause a fuss.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Namgung Jincheon nodded, but I couldn&#39;t read his thoughts at all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Are you really going to believe that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Do you have no eyes for martial arts?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is the first time a disciple of Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship has come to Namgung Sega.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jewanggeom looked at Yoo Jonghyuk with a serious look and continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The martial arts world, including our Namgung Sega, owes a great debt to Breaking the Sky Sword Saint for generations. If there&#39;s anything you want, just tell me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">What&#39;s his intention?</p>
<p class="orv_line">While I was thinking for a moment, Yoo Jonghyuk spoke first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We need a doctor who can repair the incarnation body.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s judgment was not bad. I don&#39;t know what their scheme is, but at this point, using Namgung Sega was the best way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;ll call for Shinui through my family.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shinui. If we could call them, it was one of the best options for now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because &#39;Shinui&#39; was one of the few &#39;Story Experts&#39; who could repair stories in the &#39;First Murim&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And also...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But why are you looking for a doctor? The boy doesn&#39;t seem to have any internal or external injuries.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, he thought he had leaked too much information. Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s expression hardened, and just as he was about to say something,</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is it you who needs a doctor, or is it the friend hiding in your pocket?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had no choice but to admit it. We underestimated the Emperor&#39;s Sword too much.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, it was a group of incarnations that could block &#39;high-ranking constellations&#39;, and I thought they wouldn&#39;t find out about my existence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before Yoo Jonghyuk made a mistake, I got out of Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s pocket and released &#39;Thoughts&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I was rude.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Watching me bow, the Emperor&#39;s Sword Namgung Jincheon slowly got up from his seat. A strange color flashed across his eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it had been the case, it would have been a welcome sight, but it wasn’t like that now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn, as expected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Your story is famous even in this &#39;Murim&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, I was afraid of what kind of story would spread. However, the expression on Jewanggeom’s face as he opened his mouth wasn’t all that bad.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The story of you persuading Cheongae of the Dragon Head and sending them back to the sky made the whole of Gangho buzz.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheongae of the Dragon Head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a name I hadn’t heard in a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Had the scenario from Seoul Station already spread here?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It hasn’t been widely known yet, but I also know that you recently had a fierce battle with the &#39;Master of the Spear&#39; at the Recycling Center.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something came to mind belatedly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Master of the Spear&#39; was once the patron saint of the Namgung family. And I killed him at the &#39;Recycling Center&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Jewanggeom seemed happy about that fact.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m grateful to you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That made sense. The &#39;Master of the Spear&#39; was the first constellation to run away when the &#39;Outer God Incident&#39; broke out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Namgung Sega still hadn&#39;t forgotten the grudge from that time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded and answered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;ll accept your thanks. But I don&#39;t think you came here to talk about that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re as sharp as I&#39;ve heard.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The expression on the Emperor Sword&#39;s face, which had been slightly smiling, became even more serious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know that the constellations of the Great Nebulae are looking for you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I squinted my eyes and swallowed my tension.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, if the Emperor&#39;s sword were to report us to &lt;Asgard&gt; or &lt;Olympus&gt; right now, there was nothing we could do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I have something to ask you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, if that was his purpose, the Emperor&#39;s sword wouldn&#39;t have come to us separately.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you, in front of me now, the incarnation &#39;Kim Dokja&#39;, or the constellation &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;?&quot;</p>
