<p class="orv_line">Wait. How many?</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Sponsor Selection&gt;</p>
<p>—Please select your sponsor.</p>
<p>—Your chosen sponsor will be your strong supporter.</p>
<p>1. Monarch of the Small Fries</p>
<p>2. Dragon Lying Down</p>
<p>3. Sneaking Schemer</p>
<p>.......</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">I blinked, dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This many people applied to be my sponsor?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Where did they get the word?</p>
[The constellations are awaiting your choice.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I coudn&#39;t tell. I guess we&#39;ll have to see who&#39;s here first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are a lot of people who applied, and they may not be worthy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">First up is the &#39;Monarch of the Small Fries&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I expected this one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In Omniscient Reader, he was the sponsor behind the acting leader on Geumho Station, Bang</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheolsoo. After the beginning, he disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, he was not worth considering.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Monarch of the Small Fries&#39; is glaring at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The second was the &#39;Dragon Lying Down&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This one is the Crouching Dragon(臥龍), &#39;Zhu Ge Kong Ming&#39;. He had excellent stats for a</p>
<p class="orv_line">narrative-grade constellation.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">He must have been impressed with my killing strategy, but unfortunately, I didn&#39;t plan on</p>
<p class="orv_line">choosing him here.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Dragon Lying Down&#39; is frowning.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Next up is...... Huh?</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I thought I&#39;d misread the modifier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Third, the &#39;Sneaking Schemer&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it was &#39;Secretive Plotter[1]&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An imitation?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thinking about it, I couldn&#39;t recall a constellation with this modifier.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Sneaking Schemer&#39; says he&#39;s very strong and you should choose him.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The way he&#39;s talking, he&#39;s not even worthy of the modifier. I wonder if he&#39;s actually copying the</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Secretive Plotter&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Secretive Plotter&#39; is an exceptional case, but as Kim Dokja says, it&#39;s unlikely that constellation</p>
<p class="orv_line">with such a poor modifier is a strong one.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>4. Abyssal Black Flame Dragon</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">I sucked in an involuntary breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who?</p>
[The constellation &#39;Abyssal Black Flame Dragon&#39; came after hearing rumors about you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Abyssal Black Flame Dragon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy who was the sponsor behind the Black Flame Demon Ruler Han Sooyoung in</p>

<p class="orv_line">Three question marks?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Can this be a modifier?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as I was thinking about it, a lightning bolt flashed in my head and the scene of a dark theater</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">came to mind.</p>
「&quot;What&#39;s the identity of the constellation represented by &#39;???&#39; in Omniscient Reader?&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Sure enough, the question had come up in &lt;Kim Dokja&#39;s Banquet&gt; before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew the answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the entire Omniscient Reader, there was only one constellation with the modifier &#39;???&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is the highest being who watches over everything in the universe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is the sponsor behind the regressor Yoo Joonghyuk, who only covets the next story.</p>

<p class="orv_line">I looked up at the ceiling with trembling eyes.</p>
「The Oldest Dream.」</p></div>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The entity called &quot;The Oldest Dream&quot; in Omniscient Reader is divided into two.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One is the &#39;young Kim Dokja&#39; who appears at the beginning of the novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The second is the &#39;adult Kim Dokja&#39;, who inherits the modifier in the second half of the novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unless I&#39;m being fooled by a high-level trick, this is clearly the beginning of the novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Above all, the presence of Bihyung and &#39;Daepong Girls&#39; High School&#39; Lee Jihye proved this fact.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it was after the end of the main story of &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39;, there was no way Bihyung or Lee</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jihye would have appeared like this.</p>
「So, does &#39;???&#39; is the &#39;young Kim Dokja&#39;?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, it doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Throughout the course of &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39;, &#39;Young Kim Dokja&#39; rarely interfered in the story,</p>
<p class="orv_line">except to regress Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Even when he&#39;s already Yoo Joonghyuk&#39;s sponsor?</p>
「In that case, is &#39;???&#39; the &#39;adult Kim Dokja&#39;?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I thought so, it didn&#39;t make sense either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the end of Omniscient Reader, the &#39;adult Kim Dokja&#39; had his soul split into molecules and</p>

<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I just saw you with white eyes suddenly. What happened with the Sponsor</p>

<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sponsor Selection......?&quot;</p>
[There is 10 seconds left to complete the Sponsor Selection.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Holy shit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly looked at the Sponsor Selection window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And then.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">+</p>
<p class="orv_line">9. Dog Who Threw Himself Into the Flames</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>I wondered what had happened.</p>
<p>Apparently, the &#39;10th&#39; option that was visible a moment ago has disappeared.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[There is 5 seconds left to complete the Sponsor Selection.]</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t have much time to think.</p>
<p>Should I choose the best constellation or.......</p>
<p>I pondered until the very last second and made my decision.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Sponsor Selection has ended.]</p>
<p>Apparently, this world is not the &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39; I knew.</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t quite put my finger on it, but this world was twisted in some important way.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[You haven&#39;t selected a sponsor.]</p>
<p>For now, I felt the need to wait and see what would happen. I could always choose a sponsor</p>
<p>again later.</p>
<p>As long as I somehow survived.</p>
<p>&quot;Mate?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you choose?&quot;</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi shook his head as if agreeing with my response.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, come to think of it, Kim Dokja.......&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, I couldn&#39;t decide, there were a lot of good constellations.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a lie, but I had to say it like this.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Rice Cake-Eating Tiger&#39; is relieved that was it.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Primordial Cow&#39; is relieved.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Pig Living in a Brick House&#39; asks to be picked next time.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39; nods saying that it can happen.]</p>
<p>By saying it like this, I avoided the criticism of the constellation that made a Sponsor</p>
<p>Application.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[The constellation &#39;Abyssal Black Flame Dragon&#39; accuses you of being pathetic for missing the</p>
<p>opportunity.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Sneaking Schemer&#39; is looking at you with narrowed eyes.]</p>
<p>Luckily, that was a good reaction.</p>
<p>&quot;How about you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was pretty hard for me, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How many constellations applied?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Four.&quot;</p>
<p>I was honestly surprised.</p>
<p>I mean, he have done some pretty unusual things, but four?</p>
<p>&quot;Did you get any good constellations?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There were some names I recognized.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who?&quot;</p>
<p>I was a little nervous.</p>
<p>Still, he had done the good deed of saving me, so there was a chance that if he was lucky, a nice</p>
<p>constellation would appear.</p>
<p>Luckily, the Korean Peninsula had a lot of good ones, so even he only got the &#39;Bald General&#39; or</p>
<p>&#39;King Heungmu&#39;, the initial scenarios would be fine.</p>
<p>&quot;That...... &#39;Commander of the Red Cosmos&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aha, Cosmos.......&quot;</p>
<p>I replied nonchalantly, then snapped my head up.</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;Commander of the Red Cosmos&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.......&quot;</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes as I looked at the nervous-looking Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p>This was because the star he was referring to was a narrative-grade constellation. Commander of</p>
<p>the Red Cosmos.</p>
<p>&#39;Archangel Jophiel&#39; of &lt;Eden&gt;.</p>
<p>A constellation comparable to Uriel, who visited the 1,863rd round&#39;s world line with Kim Dokja</p>
<p>and later became the ruler of &lt;Eden&gt;.</p>
<p>With a single blow of Jophiel&#39;s stigma, lower-level demons would be destroyed without a trace.</p>
<p>&quot;Is she a great constellation?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. She&#39;s great.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, I don&#39;t remember much about her...... The novel has a lot of difficult words, and it&#39;s</p>
<p>been a while since I read it.......&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I asked, trying to calm the slightly quivering corners of my mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;And the second one?&quot;</p>
<p>This time he sounded confident.</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;Goryeo&#39;s First Sword&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p>I let out a gasp.</p>
<p>Goryeo&#39;s First Sword, &#39;Cheok Jungyeong&#39;.</p>
<p>The so-called &#39;Swordmaster Cheok&#39;, a powerful Korean constellation.</p>
<p>Considering its late-game potential, it wasn&#39;t a bad choice instead of a narrative class one.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, that&#39;s awesome. What about the third one?&quot;</p>
<p>At that moment, Dansoo ahjussi&#39;s face looked strangely dignified.</p>
<p>The reason was soon revealed.</p>
<p>&quot;The third one was &#39;God of Wine and Ecstasy&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p>I wondered if I had misheard.</p>
<p>&quot;Who?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;God of Wine and Ecstasy.......&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really? You&#39;re not lying, are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why would I lie?&quot;</p>
<p>Ahjussi looked frustrated.</p>
<p>As for me, I wanted to use [Lie Detection.]</p>
<p>No, this doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>
<p>Jophiel, Goryeo&#39;s First Sword.</p>
<p>And God of Wine and Ecstasy, Dionysus?</p>
<p>Who is Dionysus?</p>
<p>Isn&#39;t he one of the twelve gods of the great nebula &lt;Olympus&gt;, and a powerful narrative-grade</p>
<p>constellation that has sided with Kim Dokja since the beginning of Omniscient Reader?</p>
<p>No, why did those constellations appear?</p>
<p>I was happy for him, but I was still a little envious and upset.</p>
<p>&quot;Who was the last one? No way the last one.......&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, the last one constellation took me by surprise.&quot;</p>
<p>Surprise?</p>
<p>For a moment, I thought about &#39;???&#39;</p>
<p>Did that option come up for him too?</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a constellation called &#39;Sneaking Schemer&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p>It turned out to be the Secretive Plotter imitation.</p>
<p>Luckily, that last one wasn&#39;t a big deal.</p>
<p>&quot;He came to me, too.&quot;</p>
<p>He sounded strangely disappointed.</p>
<p>&quot;May I ask how it was for you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I had about ten of them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, ten?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, well, I didn&#39;t get to pick anyone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;May I ask which ones they were?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, the Black Flame Dragon and.......&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Black Flame Dragon!&quot;</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi nodded, his eyes shining like a child&#39;s.</p>
<p>However, no matter how much I thought about it, there was no other constellation worth</p>
<p>mentioning than the Black Flame Dragon.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39; is frowning.]</p>
<p>I thought for a moment, then decided to do the smart thing and save everyone&#39;s pride.</p>
<p>&quot;And a dragon as famous as the Black Flame Dragon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s incredible.&quot;</p>
<p>coins.]</p>
<p>&quot;And...... There were a couple of constellation on the level of the Prisoner of the Golden</p>
<p>Headband.......&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On the level of the Prisoner of the Golden Headband.......&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Rice Cake-Eating Tiger&#39; has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Primordial Cow&#39; has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39; has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames&#39; has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p>
<p>The Prisoner of the Golden Headband is a strong monkey.</p>
<p>He doesn&#39;t know, but they&#39;re probably strong tigers, strong cows, strong rats, and strong dogs, so</p>
<p>I was not entirely wrong.</p>
<p>Seeing them rejoice made me feel good, too.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[The constellation &#39;Monarch of the Small Fries&#39; is looking at you in disbelief.]</p>
<p>Headband&#39;.]</p>
<p>......No way.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Prisoner of the Golden Headband&#39; has entered the channel.]</p>
<p>No, wait.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Rice Cake-Eating Tiger&#39; has left the channel.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Primordial Cow&#39; has left the channel.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39; has left the channel.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames&#39; has left the channel.]</p>
<p>I felt like I could hear Bihyung&#39;s scream from somewhere.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Prisoner of the Golden Headband&#39; asks where they all went.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Pig Living in a Brick House&#39; says he didn&#39;t see them because he was at home.]</p>
<p>Even as the channel fizzled, Dansoo ahjussi, who was sitting next to me, kept giving me thumbs</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, that&#39;s amazing, all those big constellations.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, but who did you pick?&quot;</p>
<p>There were three main choices.</p>
<p>Jophiel, Cheok Jungyeong and Dionysus.</p>
<p>All three are amazing constellations, so it was a matter of preference.</p>
<p>No matter who you pick, you&#39;re guaranteed a solid foundation for at least until the mid-game</p>
<p>scenarios.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a halo seemed to emanate from Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, he was a bit old, but there was an unmistakable gleam in his eyes.</p>
<p>Moreover, he had read the whole Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>Wait, this.......</p>
<p>Is he the &#39;protagonist&#39;?</p>
<p>Just as the protagonist of Omniscient Reader was Kim Dokja, maybe the protagonist of this story</p>
<p>is this ahjussi.</p>
<p>The situation was similar to that of Kim Dokja, as there were three big names attached to him</p>
<p>from the very beginning.</p>
<p>My heart suddenly began to race.</p>
<p>If this ahjussi is the protagonist.......</p>
<p>I thought of the first sentence about Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes I thought to myself. What if I were the main character.&quot;</p>
<p>Sure enough, I nodded my head in agreement with the exquise protagonist-like remarks.</p>
<p>&quot;If I were Kim Dokja, who would I have chosen in the first &#39;Sponsor Selection&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p>In the first &lt;Sponsor Selection&gt; Kim Dokja received a huge love letter from Uriel, the Great</p>
<p>Sage, Heaven&#39;s Equal, Black Flame Dragon, and the Secretive Plotter, but he made the mistake</p>
<p>of not choosing anyone.</p>
<p>&quot;I was surprised. I would have picked the strongest one, of course.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s usually the case.&quot;</p>
<p>Kim Dokja had read the 3,149 chapters of &#39;Ways of Survival&#39; that had 50,000 characters per</p>
<p>chapter, and since he was a madman who memorized them all, he could survive with that choice.</p>
<p>However, Dansoo ahjussi had only read 551 of the 5,000 characters per chapter &#39;Omniscient</p>
<p>Reader&#39;, and even then, he didn&#39;t understand most of them.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes...... I just picked the strongest constellation, as usual.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think I know who you picked.&quot;</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. I&#39;ve forgotten a lot of other things, but I do remember the name of this constellation,</p>
<p>because it&#39;s the strongest in the entire novel.&quot;</p>
<p>He was suddenly talking a lot, and I felt a little uneasy.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, ahjussi didn&#39;t even remember who Cheon Inho was.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahjussi. Sorry to disappoint you, but the &#39;Commander of the Red Cosmos&#39; is the strong, but</p>
<p>she&#39;s not the strongest.......&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#39;t pick the red flower or whatever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The &#39;God of Wine and Ecstasy&#39; is also a narrative-grade. As you know, above the narrative</p>
<p>level, there&#39;s the myth level.......&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t like alcohol.&quot;</p>
<p>I said, quickly scanning my surroundings and lowering my voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahjussi, I&#39;m Korean too, so I&#39;m very fond of &#39;Goryeo&#39;s First Sword&#39;, but.......&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m not such a patriot that I would call Cheok Jungyeong the strongest either.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then who the hell did you choose?&quot;</p>
<p>Ahjussi&#39;s eyes, which felt like guns, flashed with madness.</p>
<p>&quot;Jiyoon has always said that this constellation is the best in Omniscient Reader. That she&#39;d end</p>
<p>up getting married with him someday.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marry?</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;A man who endured the tradegy of endless regressions and finally saw the end of this world&#39;,</p>
<p>Jiyoon had that on a poster in her room.&quot;</p>
<p>I suddenly realized what had happened.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no way a reader of my novel would get that confused.</p>
<p>But Dansoo ahjussi was smiling confidently, like Kim Dokja who had already broken through</p>
<p>the [Last Wall.]</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve picked the strongest one, the &#39;Sneaking Schemer&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Sneaking Schemer&#39; is smiling brightly.]</p>
<p>I suddenly began to think that he was like Han Myungoh, who chose &#39;Lame Trickster&#39;.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The restriction on this area has been lifted!]</p>
<p>In the distance, I could see men with pipes running toward us.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The next scenario is about to begin.]</p>
<p>Maybe we&#39;ll die before we meet Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>Author&#39;s Note</p>
<p>No way!</p>
