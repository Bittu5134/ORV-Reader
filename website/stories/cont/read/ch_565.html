<p class="orv_line">Wait. How many?</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Sponsor Selection&gt;</p>
<p>—Please select your sponsor.</p>
<p>—Your chosen sponsor will be your strong supporter.</p>
<p>1. Monarch of the Small Fries</p>
<p>2. Dragon Lying Down</p>
<p>3. Sneaking Schemer</p>
<p>.......</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">I blinked, dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This many people applied to be my sponsor?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Where did they get the word?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations are awaiting your choice.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I coudn't tell. I guess we'll have to see who's here first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are a lot of people who applied, and they may not be worthy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">First up is the 'Monarch of the Small Fries'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I expected this one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In Omniscient Reader, he was the sponsor behind the acting leader on Geumho Station, Bang</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheolsoo. After the beginning, he disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, he was not worth considering.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' is glaring at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The second was the 'Dragon Lying Down'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This one is the Crouching Dragon(臥龍), 'Zhu Ge Kong Ming'. He had excellent stats for a</p>
<p class="orv_line">narrative-grade constellation.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">He must have been impressed with my killing strategy, but unfortunately, I didn't plan on</p>
<p class="orv_line">choosing him here.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Dragon Lying Down' is frowning.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Next up is...... Huh?</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I thought I'd misread the modifier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Third, the 'Sneaking Schemer'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it was 'Secretive Plotter[1]'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An imitation?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thinking about it, I couldn't recall a constellation with this modifier.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' says he's very strong and you should choose him.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The way he's talking, he's not even worthy of the modifier. I wonder if he's actually copying the</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Secretive Plotter'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Secretive Plotter' is an exceptional case, but as Kim Dokja says, it's unlikely that constellation</p>
<p class="orv_line">with such a poor modifier is a strong one.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>4. Abyssal Black Flame Dragon</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">I sucked in an involuntary breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' came after hearing rumors about you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Abyssal Black Flame Dragon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy who was the sponsor behind the Black Flame Demon Ruler Han Sooyoung in</p>
<p class="orv_line">Omniscient Reader, and one of the 'first four' of Bihyung's channel.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Sure enough, the question had come up in &lt;Kim Dokja's Banquet&gt; before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew the answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the entire Omniscient Reader, there was only one constellation with the modifier '???'</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is the highest being who watches over everything in the universe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is the sponsor behind the regressor Yoo Joonghyuk, who only covets the next story.</p>

<p class="orv_line">The entity called "The Oldest Dream" in Omniscient Reader is divided into two.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One is the 'young Kim Dokja' who appears at the beginning of the novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The second is the 'adult Kim Dokja', who inherits the modifier in the second half of the novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unless I'm being fooled by a high-level trick, this is clearly the beginning of the novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Above all, the presence of Bihyung and 'Daepong Girls' High School' Lee Jihye proved this fact.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it was after the end of the main story of 'Omniscient Reader', there was no way Bihyung or Lee</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jihye would have appeared like this.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「So, does '???' is the 'young Kim Dokja'?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, it doesn't make sense.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Throughout the course of 'Omniscient Reader', 'Young Kim Dokja' rarely interfered in the story,</p>
<p class="orv_line">except to regress Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He probably doesn't even realize he's a god.</p>

<p class="orv_line">"Oh, I'm sorry. I just saw you with white eyes suddenly. What happened with the Sponsor</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[There is 10 seconds left to complete the Sponsor Selection.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Holy shit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly looked at the Sponsor Selection window.</p>

<br>
<p class="orv_line">+</p>
<p class="orv_line">9. Dog Who Threw Himself Into the Flames</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>I wondered what had happened.</p>
<p>Apparently, the '10th' option that was visible a moment ago has disappeared.</p>
<p><!>[There is 5 seconds left to complete the Sponsor Selection.]</p>
<p>I didn't have much time to think.</p>
<p>Should I choose the best constellation or.......</p>
<p>I pondered until the very last second and made my decision.</p>
<p><!>[Sponsor Selection has ended.]</p>
<p>Apparently, this world is not the 'Omniscient Reader' I knew.</p>
<p>I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but this world was twisted in some important way.</p>
<p><!>[You haven't selected a sponsor.]</p>
<p>For now, I felt the need to wait and see what would happen. I could always choose a sponsor</p>
<p>again later.</p>
<p>As long as I somehow survived.</p>
<p>"Mate?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Did you choose?"</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi shook his head as if agreeing with my response.</p>
<p>"Oh, come to think of it, Kim Dokja......."</p>
<p>"No, no, I couldn't decide, there were a lot of good constellations."</p>
<p>It's a lie, but I had to say it like this.</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' is relieved that was it.]</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Primordial Cow' is relieved.]</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Pig Living in a Brick House' asks to be picked next time.]</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' nods saying that it can happen.]</p>
<p>By saying it like this, I avoided the criticism of the constellation that made a Sponsor</p>
<p>Application.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' accuses you of being pathetic for missing the</p>
<p>opportunity.]</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' is looking at you with narrowed eyes.]</p>
<p>Luckily, that was a good reaction.</p>
<p>"How about you?"</p>
<p>"It was pretty hard for me, too."</p>
<p>"How many constellations applied?"</p>
<p>"Four."</p>
<p>I was honestly surprised.</p>
<p>I mean, he have done some pretty unusual things, but four?</p>
<p>"Did you get any good constellations?"</p>
<p>"There were some names I recognized."</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>I was a little nervous.</p>
<p>Still, he had done the good deed of saving me, so there was a chance that if he was lucky, a nice</p>
<p>constellation would appear.</p>
<p>Luckily, the Korean Peninsula had a lot of good ones, so even he only got the 'Bald General' or</p>
<p>'King Heungmu', the initial scenarios would be fine.</p>
<p>"That...... 'Commander of the Red Cosmos'."</p>
<p>"Aha, Cosmos......."</p>
<p>I replied nonchalantly, then snapped my head up.</p>
<p>"'Commander of the Red Cosmos'?"</p>
<p>"Yes......."</p>
<p>I couldn't believe my eyes as I looked at the nervous-looking Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p>This was because the star he was referring to was a narrative-grade constellation. Commander of</p>
<p>the Red Cosmos.</p>
<p>'Archangel Jophiel' of &lt;Eden&gt;.</p>
<p>A constellation comparable to Uriel, who visited the 1,863rd round's world line with Kim Dokja</p>
<p>and later became the ruler of &lt;Eden&gt;.</p>
<p>With a single blow of Jophiel's stigma, lower-level demons would be destroyed without a trace.</p>
<p>"Is she a great constellation?"</p>
<p>"Yes. She's great."</p>
<p>"Actually, I don't remember much about her...... The novel has a lot of difficult words, and it's</p>
<p>been a while since I read it......."</p>
<p></p>
<p>I asked, trying to calm the slightly quivering corners of my mouth.</p>
<p>"And the second one?"</p>
<p>This time he sounded confident.</p>
<p>"'Goryeo's First Sword'."</p>
<p>I let out a gasp.</p>
<p>Goryeo's First Sword, 'Cheok Jungyeong'.</p>
<p>The so-called 'Swordmaster Cheok', a powerful Korean constellation.</p>
<p>Considering its late-game potential, it wasn't a bad choice instead of a narrative class one.</p>
<p>"Wow, that's awesome. What about the third one?"</p>
<p>At that moment, Dansoo ahjussi's face looked strangely dignified.</p>
<p>The reason was soon revealed.</p>
<p>"The third one was 'God of Wine and Ecstasy'."</p>
<p>I wondered if I had misheard.</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"God of Wine and Ecstasy......."</p>
<p>"Really? You're not lying, are you?"</p>
<p>"Why would I lie?"</p>
<p>Ahjussi looked frustrated.</p>
<p>As for me, I wanted to use [Lie Detection.]</p>
<p>No, this doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Jophiel, Goryeo's First Sword.</p>
<p>And God of Wine and Ecstasy, Dionysus?</p>
<p>Who is Dionysus?</p>
<p>Isn't he one of the twelve gods of the great nebula &lt;Olympus&gt;, and a powerful narrative-grade</p>
<p>constellation that has sided with Kim Dokja since the beginning of Omniscient Reader?</p>
<p>No, why did those constellations appear?</p>
<p>I was happy for him, but I was still a little envious and upset.</p>
<p>"Who was the last one? No way the last one......."</p>
<p>"Well, the last one constellation took me by surprise."</p>
<p>Surprise?</p>
<p>For a moment, I thought about '???'</p>
<p>Did that option come up for him too?</p>
<p></p>
<p>"It's a constellation called 'Sneaking Schemer'."</p>
<p>It turned out to be the Secretive Plotter imitation.</p>
<p>Luckily, that last one wasn't a big deal.</p>
<p>"He came to me, too."</p>
<p>He sounded strangely disappointed.</p>
<p>"May I ask how it was for you?"</p>
<p>"I had about ten of them."</p>
<p>"What, ten?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, I didn't get to pick anyone."</p>
<p>"May I ask which ones they were?"</p>
<p>"Well, the Black Flame Dragon and......."</p>
<p>"Black Flame Dragon!"</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi nodded, his eyes shining like a child's.</p>
<p>However, no matter how much I thought about it, there was no other constellation worth</p>
<p>mentioning than the Black Flame Dragon.</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' is frowning.]</p>
<p>I thought for a moment, then decided to do the smart thing and save everyone's pride.</p>
<p>"And a dragon as famous as the Black Flame Dragon."</p>
<p>"That's incredible."</p>
<p>coins.]</p>
<p>"And...... There were a couple of constellation on the level of the Prisoner of the Golden</p>
<p>Headband......."</p>
<p>"On the level of the Prisoner of the Golden Headband......."</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Primordial Cow' has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames' has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p>
<p>The Prisoner of the Golden Headband is a strong monkey.</p>
<p>He doesn't know, but they're probably strong tigers, strong cows, strong rats, and strong dogs, so</p>
<p>I was not entirely wrong.</p>
<p>Seeing them rejoice made me feel good, too.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' is looking at you in disbelief.]</p>
<p>Headband'.]</p>
<p>......No way.</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' has entered the channel.]</p>
<p>No, wait.</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' has left the channel.]</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Primordial Cow' has left the channel.]</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' has left the channel.]</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames' has left the channel.]</p>
<p>I felt like I could hear Bihyung's scream from somewhere.</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' asks where they all went.]</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Pig Living in a Brick House' says he didn't see them because he was at home.]</p>
<p>Even as the channel fizzled, Dansoo ahjussi, who was sitting next to me, kept giving me thumbs</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>"Wow, that's amazing, all those big constellations."</p>
<p>"No, but who did you pick?"</p>
<p>There were three main choices.</p>
<p>Jophiel, Cheok Jungyeong and Dionysus.</p>
<p>All three are amazing constellations, so it was a matter of preference.</p>
<p>No matter who you pick, you're guaranteed a solid foundation for at least until the mid-game</p>
<p>scenarios.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a halo seemed to emanate from Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, he was a bit old, but there was an unmistakable gleam in his eyes.</p>
<p>Moreover, he had read the whole Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>Wait, this.......</p>
<p>Is he the 'protagonist'?</p>
<p>Just as the protagonist of Omniscient Reader was Kim Dokja, maybe the protagonist of this story</p>
<p>is this ahjussi.</p>
<p>The situation was similar to that of Kim Dokja, as there were three big names attached to him</p>
<p>from the very beginning.</p>
<p>My heart suddenly began to race.</p>
<p>If this ahjussi is the protagonist.......</p>
<p>I thought of the first sentence about Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Sometimes I thought to myself. What if I were the main character."</p>
<p>Sure enough, I nodded my head in agreement with the exquise protagonist-like remarks.</p>
<p>"If I were Kim Dokja, who would I have chosen in the first 'Sponsor Selection'?"</p>
<p>In the first &lt;Sponsor Selection&gt; Kim Dokja received a huge love letter from Uriel, the Great</p>
<p>Sage, Heaven's Equal, Black Flame Dragon, and the Secretive Plotter, but he made the mistake</p>
<p>of not choosing anyone.</p>
<p>"I was surprised. I would have picked the strongest one, of course."</p>
<p>"That's usually the case."</p>
<p>Kim Dokja had read the 3,149 chapters of 'Ways of Survival' that had 50,000 characters per</p>
<p>chapter, and since he was a madman who memorized them all, he could survive with that choice.</p>
<p>However, Dansoo ahjussi had only read 551 of the 5,000 characters per chapter 'Omniscient</p>
<p>Reader', and even then, he didn't understand most of them.</p>
<p>"Yes...... I just picked the strongest constellation, as usual."</p>
<p>"I think I know who you picked."</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes. I've forgotten a lot of other things, but I do remember the name of this constellation,</p>
<p>because it's the strongest in the entire novel."</p>
<p>He was suddenly talking a lot, and I felt a little uneasy.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, ahjussi didn't even remember who Cheon Inho was.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi. Sorry to disappoint you, but the 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is the strong, but</p>
<p>she's not the strongest......."</p>
<p>"I didn't pick the red flower or whatever."</p>
<p>"The 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' is also a narrative-grade. As you know, above the narrative</p>
<p>level, there's the myth level......."</p>
<p>"I don't like alcohol."</p>
<p>I said, quickly scanning my surroundings and lowering my voice.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi, I'm Korean too, so I'm very fond of 'Goryeo's First Sword', but......."</p>
<p>"I'm not such a patriot that I would call Cheok Jungyeong the strongest either."</p>
<p>"Then who the hell did you choose?"</p>
<p>Ahjussi's eyes, which felt like guns, flashed with madness.</p>
<p>"Jiyoon has always said that this constellation is the best in Omniscient Reader. That she'd end</p>
<p>up getting married with him someday."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marry?</p>
<p>"'A man who endured the tradegy of endless regressions and finally saw the end of this world',</p>
<p>Jiyoon had that on a poster in her room."</p>
<p>I suddenly realized what had happened.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>There's no way a reader of my novel would get that confused.</p>
<p>But Dansoo ahjussi was smiling confidently, like Kim Dokja who had already broken through</p>
<p>the [Last Wall.]</p>
<p>"I've picked the strongest one, the 'Sneaking Schemer'."</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' is smiling brightly.]</p>
<p>I suddenly began to think that he was like Han Myungoh, who chose 'Lame Trickster'.</p>
<p><!>[The restriction on this area has been lifted!]</p>
<p>In the distance, I could see men with pipes running toward us.</p>
<p><!>[The next scenario is about to begin.]</p>
<p>Maybe we'll die before we meet Kim Dokja.</p>
