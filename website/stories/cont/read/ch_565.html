<p class="orv_line">Wait. How many?</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Sponsor Selection&gt;</p>
<p>—Please select your sponsor.</p>
<p>—Your chosen sponsor will be your strong supporter.</p>
<p>1. Monarch of the Small Fries</p>
<p>2. Dragon Lying Down</p>
<p>3. Sneaking Schemer</p>
<p>.......</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">I blinked, dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This many people applied to be my sponsor?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Where did they get the word?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations are awaiting your choice.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I coudn't tell. I guess we'll have to see who's here first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are a lot of people who applied, and they may not be worthy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">First up is the 'Monarch of the Small Fries'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I expected this one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In Omniscient Reader, he was the sponsor behind the acting leader on Geumho Station, Bang Cheolsoo. After the beginning, he disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, he was not worth considering.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' is glaring at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The second was the 'Dragon Lying Down'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This one is the Crouching Dragon(臥龍), 'Zhu Ge Kong Ming'. He had excellent stats for a narrative-grade constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He must have been impressed with my killing strategy, but unfortunately, I didn't plan on choosing him here.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Dragon Lying Down' is frowning.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Next up is...... Huh?</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I thought I'd misread the modifier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Third, the 'Sneaking Schemer'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it was 'Secretive Plotter'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An imitation?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thinking about it, I couldn't recall a constellation with this modifier.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' says he's very strong and you should choose him.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The way he's talking, he's not even worthy of the modifier. I wonder if he's actually copying the 'Secretive Plotter'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Secretive Plotter' is an exceptional case, but as Kim Dokja says, it's unlikely that constellation with such a poor modifier is a strong one.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>4. Abyssal Black Flame Dragon</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">I sucked in an involuntary breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' came after hearing rumors about you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Abyssal Black Flame Dragon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy who was the sponsor behind the Black Flame Demon Ruler Han Sooyoung in Omniscient Reader, and one of the 'first four' of Bihyung's channel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's been a long time since I've seen that modifier.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' tells you to decide quickly.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Now that I think about it, he's been all over Kim Namwoon, Han Sooyoung, Kim Dokja, and Yoo Joonghyuk before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, does that mean I'm also a main character?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is cancelling his 'Sponsor Application'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The number of options for sponsors has reduced to 9.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Short-tempered bastard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wasn't planning on choosing him anyway, so it wasn't a shame.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were still six more to go.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>5. Nail-Eating Rat</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly regretted rejecting Black Flame Dragon.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>6. Primordial Cow</p>
<p>7. Rice Cake-Eating Tiger</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Not yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are still three more to go.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>8. Pig Living in a Brick House</p>
<p>9. Dog Who Threw Himself Into the Flames</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">What the hell is going on here?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Don't tell me there's some kind of 'zodiacal pickup only' event.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I closed my eyes, took a light, deep breath, and muttered my own lucky charm.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I am Kim Dokja. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I checked the last constellation.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>10. ???</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Three question marks?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Can this be a modifier?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as I was thinking about it, a lightning bolt flashed in my head and the scene of a dark theater came to mind.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "What's the identity of the constellation represented by '???' in Omniscient Reader?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Sure enough, the question had come up in &lt;Kim Dokja's Banquet&gt; before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew the answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the entire Omniscient Reader, there was only one constellation with the modifier '???'</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is the highest being who watches over everything in the universe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is the sponsor behind the regressor Yoo Joonghyuk, who only covets the next story.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The protagonist of 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked up at the ceiling with trembling eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The Oldest Dream. 」</p></div>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The entity called "The Oldest Dream" in Omniscient Reader is divided into two.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One is the 'young Kim Dokja' who appears at the beginning of the novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The second is the 'adult Kim Dokja', who inherits the modifier in the second half of the novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unless I'm being fooled by a high-level trick, this is clearly the beginning of the novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Above all, the presence of Bihyung and 'Daepong Girls' High School' Lee Jihye proved this fact.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it was after the end of the main story of 'Omniscient Reader', there was no way Bihyung or Lee Jihye would have appeared like this.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 So, does '???' is the 'young Kim Dokja'? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, it doesn't make sense.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Throughout the course of 'Omniscient Reader', 'Young Kim Dokja' rarely interfered in the story, except to regress Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He probably doesn't even realize he's a god.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And now he's making me a 'Sponsor Application', a man who doesn't even appear in 'Ways of Survival'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even when he's already Yoo Joonghyuk's sponsor?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 In that case, is '???' the 'adult Kim Dokja'? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I thought so, it didn't make sense either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the end of Omniscient Reader, the 'adult Kim Dokja' had his soul split into molecules and scattered into the universe.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is awaiting your choice.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A cold tension radiating down my spine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You...... Who are you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I ask, not really expecting an answer, but.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My breathing stopped, and a chill spread through my body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a tsuchuchut, my entire body began to glow blue, followed by a terrible pain as if my spine was on fire, engulfing my consciousness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【■■■ ■■.】</p></div>

<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I opened my eyes again, ahjussi was shaking me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wake up, mate!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">My body shook helplessly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I came to my senses with a start.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Blood trickled from my nose.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What the hell? What just happened?</p>
<p class="orv_line">In my daze, ahjussi continued to shake me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I think I'm going to throw up......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, I'm sorry. I just saw you with white eyes suddenly. What happened with the Sponsor Selection?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sponsor Selection......?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There is 10 seconds left to complete the Sponsor Selection.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Holy shit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly looked at the Sponsor Selection window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And then.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>9. Dog Who Threw Himself Into the Flames</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered what had happened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, the '10th' option that was visible a moment ago has disappeared.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There is 5 seconds left to complete the Sponsor Selection.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't have much time to think.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Should I choose the best constellation or.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pondered until the very last second and made my decision.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Sponsor Selection has ended.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, this world is not the 'Omniscient Reader' I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but this world was twisted in some important way.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You haven't selected a sponsor.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">For now, I felt the need to wait and see what would happen. I could always choose a sponsor again later.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As long as I somehow survived.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Mate?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you choose?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shook my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi shook his head as if agreeing with my response.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, come to think of it, Kim Dokja......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, no, I couldn't decide, there were a lot of good constellations."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's a lie, but I had to say it like this.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' is relieved that was it.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Primordial Cow' is relieved.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Pig Living in a Brick House' asks to be picked next time.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' nods saying that it can happen.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">By saying it like this, I avoided the criticism of the constellation that made a Sponsor Application.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' accuses you of being pathetic for missing the opportunity.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' is looking at you with narrowed eyes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, that was a good reaction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How about you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It was pretty hard for me, too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How many constellations applied?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Four."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was honestly surprised.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I mean, he have done some pretty unusual things, but four?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you get any good constellations?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There were some names I recognized."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was a little nervous.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, he had done the good deed of saving me, so there was a chance that if he was lucky, a nice constellation would appear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, the Korean Peninsula had a lot of good ones, so even he only got the 'Bald General' or 'King Heungmu', the initial scenarios would be fine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That...... 'Commander of the Red Cosmos'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aha, Cosmos......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I replied nonchalantly, then snapped my head up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"'Commander of the Red Cosmos'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't believe my eyes as I looked at the nervous-looking Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was because the star he was referring to was a narrative-grade constellation. Commander of the Red Cosmos.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Archangel Jophiel' of &lt;Eden&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A constellation comparable to Uriel, who visited the 1,863rd round's world line with Kim Dokja and later became the ruler of &lt;Eden&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a single blow of Jophiel's stigma, lower-level demons would be destroyed without a trace.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is she a great constellation?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. She's great."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Actually, I don't remember much about her...... The novel has a lot of difficult words, and it's been a while since I read it......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked, trying to calm the slightly quivering corners of my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"And the second one?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time he sounded confident.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"'Goryeo's First Sword'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I let out a gasp.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goryeo's First Sword, 'Cheok Jungyeong'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The so-called 'Swordmaster Cheok', a powerful Korean constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Considering its late-game potential, it wasn't a bad choice instead of a narrative class one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wow, that's awesome. What about the third one?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, Dansoo ahjussi's face looked strangely dignified.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason was soon revealed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The third one was 'God of Wine and Ecstasy'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if I had misheard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"God of Wine and Ecstasy......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Really? You're not lying, are you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why would I lie?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi looked frustrated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As for me, I wanted to use [Lie Detection.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, this doesn't make sense.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jophiel, Goryeo's First Sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And God of Wine and Ecstasy, Dionysus?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who is Dionysus?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Isn't he one of the twelve gods of the great nebula &lt;Olympus&gt;, and a powerful narrative-grade constellation that has sided with Kim Dokja since the beginning of Omniscient Reader?</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, why did those constellations appear?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was happy for him, but I was still a little envious and upset.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who was the last one? No way the last one......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, the last one constellation took me by surprise."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surprise?</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I thought about '???'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did that option come up for him too?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's a constellation called 'Sneaking Schemer'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It turned out to be the Secretive Plotter imitation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, that last one wasn't a big deal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He came to me, too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He sounded strangely disappointed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"May I ask how it was for you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I had about ten of them."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What, ten?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yeah, well, I didn't get to pick anyone."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"May I ask which ones they were?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, the Black Flame Dragon and......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Black Flame Dragon!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi nodded, his eyes shining like a child's.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, no matter how much I thought about it, there was no other constellation worth mentioning than the Black Flame Dragon.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' is frowning.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a moment, then decided to do the smart thing and save everyone's pride.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"And a dragon as famous as the Black Flame Dragon."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's incredible."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Dragon Lying Down' is moved by your words and has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"And...... There were a couple of constellation on the level of the Prisoner of the Golden Headband......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"On the level of the Prisoner of the Golden Headband......."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Primordial Cow' has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames' has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Prisoner of the Golden Headband is a strong monkey.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He doesn't know, but they're probably strong tigers, strong cows, strong rats, and strong dogs, so I was not entirely wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Seeing them rejoice made me feel good, too.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' is looking at you in disbelief.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' is calling out for the 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">......No way.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' has entered the channel.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">No, wait.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' has left the channel.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Primordial Cow' has left the channel.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' has left the channel.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames' has left the channel.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like I could hear Bihyung's scream from somewhere.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' asks where they all went.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Pig Living in a Brick House' says he didn't see them because he was at home.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even as the channel fizzled, Dansoo ahjussi, who was sitting next to me, kept giving me thumbs up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wow, that's amazing, all those big constellations."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, but who did you pick?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were three main choices.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jophiel, Cheok Jungyeong and Dionysus.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All three are amazing constellations, so it was a matter of preference.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter who you pick, you're guaranteed a solid foundation for at least until the mid-game scenarios.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, a halo seemed to emanate from Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Upon closer inspection, he was a bit old, but there was an unmistakable gleam in his eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Moreover, he had read the whole Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wait, this.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is he the 'protagonist'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as the protagonist of Omniscient Reader was Kim Dokja, maybe the protagonist of this story is this ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The situation was similar to that of Kim Dokja, as there were three big names attached to him from the very beginning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart suddenly began to race.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this ahjussi is the protagonist.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of the first sentence about Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sometimes I thought to myself. What if I were the main character."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sure enough, I nodded my head in agreement with the exquise protagonist-like remarks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If I were Kim Dokja, who would I have chosen in the first 'Sponsor Selection'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the first &lt;Sponsor Selection&gt; Kim Dokja received a huge love letter from Uriel, the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal, Black Flame Dragon, and the Secretive Plotter, but he made the mistake of not choosing anyone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I was surprised. I would have picked the strongest one, of course."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's usually the case."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja had read the 3,149 chapters of 'Ways of Survival' that had 50,000 characters per chapter, and since he was a madman who memorized them all, he could survive with that choice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Dansoo ahjussi had only read 551 of the 5,000 characters per chapter 'Omniscient Reader', and even then, he didn't understand most of them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes...... I just picked the strongest constellation, as usual."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I think I know who you picked."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi smiled and nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. I've forgotten a lot of other things, but I do remember the name of this constellation, because it's the strongest in the entire novel."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was suddenly talking a lot, and I felt a little uneasy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, ahjussi didn't even remember who Cheon Inho was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi. Sorry to disappoint you, but the 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is the strong, but she's not the strongest......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn't pick the red flower or whatever."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' is also a narrative-grade. As you know, above the narrative level, there's the myth level......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't like alcohol."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said, quickly scanning my surroundings and lowering my voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi, I'm Korean too, so I'm very fond of 'Goryeo's First Sword', but......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm not such a patriot that I would call Cheok Jungyeong the strongest either."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then who the hell did you choose?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi's eyes, which felt like guns, flashed with madness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Jiyoon has always said that this constellation is the best in Omniscient Reader. That she'd end up getting married with him someday."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Marry?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"'A man who endured the tradegy of endless regressions and finally saw the end of this world', Jiyoon had that on a poster in her room."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly realized what had happened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, no, no.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There's no way a reader of my novel would get that confused.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Dansoo ahjussi was smiling confidently, like Kim Dokja who had already broken through the [Last Wall.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I've picked the strongest one, the 'Sneaking Schemer'."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' is smiling brightly.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly began to think that he was like Han Myungoh, who chose 'Lame Trickster'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The restriction on this area has been lifted!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, I could see men with pipes running toward us.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The next scenario is about to begin.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe we'll die before we meet Kim Dokja.</p>
