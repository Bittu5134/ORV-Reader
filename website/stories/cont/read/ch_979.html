            <div class="orv_title"><h1>979 Episode 58 Mythical Constellation (11)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Mythical Circle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I reached the status of 'Mythical', I briefly glimpsed its landscape. But I didn't feel like I was a part of that world. At the time, I was a visitor of sorts. I could see its scenery, but I couldn't interfere with its events.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This seems to be the greatest gift I can give now.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A dazzlingly colored dice rose from Mithra's right hand, radiating a dazzling light.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, the owner of December 25th, has transferred his 'Dice of Destiny' to you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The dice flew along a thread of light and settled into my palm. The sensation was so familiar, as if it had been mine from the beginning. I knew it instinctively.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Mitra has transferred to me his membership in the 'Round Table of Myths'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">These 'dice' were my ticket to the 'Round Table of Mythology'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[When all stars reach the level of myths, they possess their own crystals of stories, condensed to the utmost extent.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I belatedly realized the identity of the dice spinning in my hand. The dice were likely the crystals of stories created when Mitra first ascended to the level of Mythology.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You didn't attain Mythology through a 'constellation', so you wouldn't have received the dice. So, take my dice.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A low thunder rumbled through the sky as Mitra declared.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some constellations respect the decision of the 'Lord of December 25th'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the nebula, &lt;Veda&gt;, strongly question the judgment of the 'Lord of December 25th'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Mitra looked up at the sky. Immediately, the sky became silent.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, 'Lord of December 25th', reveals his true nature!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the nebula, &lt;Veda&gt;, obey the will of the 'Lord of December 25th'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A being capable of enforcing its own will, defying the will of the Great Nebula.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What I have now received is the essence of such a mythical constellation, carved from its own story.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The relic, 'Dice of Destiny', is placed in your hand.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Mitra, who handed me the dice, had a look of deep regret and relief on his face. I thought perhaps now was the time to hear an honest answer from him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Mitra, what exactly is the 'Round Table'? And what are these dice?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in 'Ways of Survival', the 'Round Table' was not specifically described. It merely mentioned a secret banquet hall where 'mythical constellations' gathered. Even Kim Dokja, who had reached myth-grade, wasn't invited to the Round Table, so I was woefully lacking in information.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Round Table is where the fate of the world is decided. And only those with the dice can interfere with that fate.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Mitra gazed silently at the sky, as if reading the heavens, and added:</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Only the chosen mythic constellations can enter the Round Table banquet, and they can manipulate the greatest probability of the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Is it okay for you to give me something so grand?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[It doesn't matter. I don't want to return to the Round Table anymore. Even if I did, there wouldn't be much I could do. But maybe it's different for you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Mitra smiled weakly and helped his fallen subordinates up one by one. The mythic constellations, blessed by Mitra's grace, regained their strength one by one.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[If you truly seek the ■■ of all these stories, you'll have to pass through there at least once.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Mitra, speaking thus, looked so exhausted that I felt this entire scene was like his retirement ceremony.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aren't you curious about your own ■■ now?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Is there any constellation that isn't curious about that?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Then why did you give me the dice?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Every star lives dreaming of the ■■ of all stories. Born that way, they can't help but exist that way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Mitra had just laid down his 'dice', which would allow him to participate in the final gamble.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[When I first remained in the 'Valhalla Hall', many thoughts crossed my mind.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The radiance emanating from his entire being had dimmed. A language that didn't require coercion. He was now calmly speaking his true feelings.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[A desire to avenge my defeat. A desire to take revenge on the 'Round Table' for ignoring me. I want to startle the Star Stream once again by causing a story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Does that mean not now?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Through the dice, I could vaguely sense Mitra's legend.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Mitra, who had lost the duel with 'Snowfield Kim Dokja' and become the master of the 'Valhalla Hall'. There was the history of Mitra, who had managed the constellations in the hall and witnessed countless competitions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a brief pause, Mitra continued speaking.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Once you ascend to the level of myth, you no longer have to look back on trivial stories. Unless it's a Giant Story, you rarely pay attention, and all day long, consumed by a feeling of laziness, you revisit the history of your life over and over again.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">To complete a world means to close the door to it and become imprisoned. To complete a myth meant to imprison yourself within that myth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that sense, all the 'myth-grade constellations' that reached the pinnacle of this world were prisoners of the story.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[While staying in the hall, I was finally able to look back on other stories.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Amidst this, an opportunity presented itself to Mitra.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I was imprisoned in the Valhalla Hall, but in a sense, I was also liberated from my own stories. Because I was forced to see other stories.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There, Mitra witnessed countless incarnations and stars dying.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There's one game I remember. It was the game where a transcendent appeared.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Which transcendent was it?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Why, a famous one. However, it wasn't the transcendent that caught my eye. It was another incarnation on that transcendent's team.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was the transcendent's team, but his attention wasn't drawn to the transcendent, but to another incarnation?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He must have been a strong incarnation."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[No, he wasn't as strong as the transcendent. He wasn't a weak incarnation, but he wasn't someone with exceptional talent to attract attention.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a peculiar story. An incarnation, neither as strong as the transcendent, nor possessing any special talents, caught Mitra's attention. Why on earth?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[It was a consistently unfavorable match. The enemy team was far too strong, and the transcendent's team was quickly decimated. The transcendent was surprisingly strong, and they put up a good fight, but that was it. It was a fight whose outcome was already decided.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The picture was forming. If the transcendent, of that caliber, had lost, the opponent would likely have been a 'Giant Nebula'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And even the transcendent died in the end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though it was just a replay of the past match, I felt a pang of regret. Perhaps it was because I thought the transcendent might be someone I knew.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Still, the incarnation didn't give up.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"He didn't give up?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[He ran desperately, knowing there was no chance of winning.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I guess he was planning to find the prophecy."</p>
<p class="orv_line">With the prophecy in hand, there's a chance of turning the tables, no matter how unfavorable the situation. But Mitra shook his head.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[That was all he could do. He kept running, losing his arm, losing his leg, having one eye gouged out, and having every nerve in his body burned by the lightning.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Just hearing the description, I could tell just how horrific the situation of the incarnation in the story had been. That made him seem as determined to survive as Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Was that fact impressive?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[No. Anyone can run. If their life is on the line, that is.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That's right. Everyone's life is precious. Of course, some incarnations are overwhelmed by circumstances and give up, but others cling to hope.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what the incarnation in the story wanted to protect wasn't his own life.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[He was holding a child in his arms with his one remaining arm.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I forgot to breathe and focused on the story.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[As you know, it's not easy to reach Scenario 85 and fight to protect someone.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how solid a story you build, those who reach Scenario 85 are bound to have some part of their psyche worn down. Their emotions are frayed, and they lose their sense of preciousness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I see he had a child of his own."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[No, it was a child who had no blood connection to that incarnation.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That was a strange story. A truly strange story, but one that didn't sound entirely strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because at that moment...</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What happened to that incarnation?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought I knew who that incarnation was.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[It was a success.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My heart pounded involuntarily. "It was a success." That was how Mitra had put it. As expected, it was a strange way of saying it. The outcome of the skirmish was either victory or defeat. But Mitra had said he 'succeeded'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[He ran, ran, and fled out of this 'arena'. He escaped from the prison of the scenario that imprisoned him.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A long ringing in my ears echoed. Finally, unable to bear it, I asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"By any chance, is that incarnation's name 'Lee Dansu'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Mitra considered the question for a moment before answering.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Is that incarnation familiar?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded with difficulty. Suppressing my surging heart, I calmly asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. What happened to him after that?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I don't know what happened after that. He disappeared beyond 'Valhalla Hall'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I tried my best to hide my trembling breath. Still, I couldn't hide the emotion welling up within me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Dansu ahjussi is alive. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He fought the constellations, fled, and eventually, with a child, discovered the 'Missing Bush' and escaped the skirmish.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I recall his answer to the enemy constellations' question about why he was so protective of the child.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, it seemed as if I could hear the vivid voice of Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "You who ask why I must protect the child, even if I tell you my reason, you won't understand." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt breathless. It was unmistakable. He was Dansu ahjussi. Even after eight years, he was still the same Dansu ahjussi I remember.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There is a sentence left by the recorder who watched over him until the very end.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The next moment, the recorder's sentence floated in the air.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Those who have protected their primes to the very end may know what lies there without even seeing the ■■ of the world. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I thought about Dansu ahjussi. Dansu ahjussi, who had been searching for his daughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His daughter, Jiyoon, was in Asmodeus's theater. So, what if he were to protect someone to the very end?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who on earth was that child?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[And strangely enough, after reading that incarnation's story, the original value within me changed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Changed?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I know it sounds strange. I also know it's absurd that a star that has reached the level of a myth could suddenly change after reading a single incarnation's story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Mitra continued, as if certain I wouldn't believe him.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[For a constellation that has lived for thousands, even tens of thousands of years, to change the direction of its starlight simply by reading a story—even I can't imagine it.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Mitra was right. This wasn't just for constellations, but for humans as well. Few beings have their lives changed by a single story.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Still, I know full well that that story isn't impossible. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I already knew of several constellations that had read a story, loved it, and changed the direction of their starlight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And Mitra, too, was looking at the stars following him with a similar expression to the constellations I knew. They were the stars gathered in the 'Valhalla Hall'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Actually, I hadn't made up my mind until then. But now, I've made up my mind. Other myth-grade constellations might point fingers at me, calling me a loser. Still, I feel it's okay now. I don't care if I don't receive the Round Table's approval. I don't care if the other constellations laugh at my choices.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The stars of the 'Hall of Golden Dice'. They were all stars from different nebulae, but now they had decided to leave their own affiliations and follow Mitra.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Mitra looked at them and said,</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I still wonder about the ■■ of the world. But I chose not to confirm it myself.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The dice in my hand vibrated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi wasn't Kim Dokja. Yet, he had, perhaps, accomplished something similar. He had lived his life to the fullest and protected what was precious.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I intend to escape this '■■' hell with the stars who follow me. Just as that incarnation had done.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Thus, ahjussi succeeded in changing the starlight of the great myth-grade constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Mitra, with a faint smile, said, as if he already knew what I was thinking.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I will now tell you where the 'Missing Bush' is.]</p></div>
