<p class="orv_line">After a while, the glow subsided.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, Dansoo ahjussi and I looked at each other, swallowed hard, and opened the box at</p>
<p class="orv_line">the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Inside the box was a vibrant, light-blue colored spirit, about the size of an adult male&#x27;s fist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein frowned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s changed color? It&#x27;s like Biyoo&#x27;s poop.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s check it out.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I went straight for the slime. But just before I reached for it, the slime squirmed and dodged my</p>
<p class="orv_line">hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Upon closer inspection, the slime had eyes. Narrow eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Giw—me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It even had a tiny mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if it looked like me (Cheon Inho).</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Giw—me. Giw—me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein tilted her head.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is it swearing?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, I think it&#x27;s saying, &#x27;give me&#x27;. I think it&#x27;s asking for food.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How do you know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because it&#x27;s similar to what Jiyoon used to babble.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a moment&#x27;s hesitation, Dansoo ahjussi worriedly handed over the leftover ground rat meat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The slime looked at it, and then jumped at his hand. It wasn&#x27;t the ground rat meat that it ate, but</p>
<p class="orv_line">the bracelet he was wearing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi freaked out and jumped back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wilson!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently he&#x27;d given the bracelet a name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The slime quickly realized the bracelet was tasteless, spat it out, and curled up with a grunt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the next moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The slime was a bracelet.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After we finished organizing our items, we made our escape from the &#x27;Edge of Darkness&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, ahjussi had a cockroach in his pocket, so it wasn&#x27;t hard to find our way out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But...... why does the back of my head keep itching?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi, is there something wrong?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, it&#x27;s just.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I added, peering into the &#x27;Edge of Darkness&#x27; where I couldn&#x27;t see anything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s just that I feel like someone keeps looking at me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, it&#x27;s just your imagination.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Even the bugs say there&#x27;s nothing there.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If ahjussi says there&#x27;s nothing there, there&#x27;s nothing there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this point, the one person he can&#x27;t detect with his [Diverse Communication] is Killer King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By now, he must be holding the box that has run out of uses with killing intent. I thought of</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King, who was probably repeating &#x27;Cheon Inho&#x27; over and over again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well...... at least I didn&#x27;t give him an empty box, so I guess it&#x27;s okay.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he makes good use of the notes I put in the box, he&#x27;ll still get a decent income.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, whatever he gets will be less than the bracelet on my wrist.</p>

<p>&lt;Item Information&gt;</p>
<p>Name: Idea of Almost Anything</p>
<p>Rating: Star Relic (遺物)</p>
<p>Description: A mysterious slime that was once the product of a constellation&#x27;s obsession of</p>
<p>studying &#x27;almost everything&#x27;.</p>
<p>When worn, it increases Agility and Magic Power levels by 1 each.</p>
<p>* &#x27;Idea&#x27; can use &#x27;mimicry&#x27;.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Formed Idea (意態).</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Idea of Almost Anything&#x27; can mimic an item by touching it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since it&#x27;s a top-rated item, it cannot mimic others simply by touching them, but only after certain</p>
<p class="orv_line">conditions are met.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Once successfully mimicked, the item can be used continuously until the mimicked form is</p>
<p class="orv_line">destroyed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the &#x27;Idea of Almost Anything&#x27; may, out of its own free will, refuse to obey its owner&#x27;s</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;mimicry command&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>As you can probably tell from the description, this was a scam item. In theory, it could be almost</p>
<p>anything.</p>
<p>However, &#x27;Idea of Almost Anything&#x27; had two fatal flaws.</p>
<p>One is that you can&#x27;t rely on it if you don&#x27;t meet the &#x27;mimicry&#x27; conditions.</p>
<p>And the second was that the &#x27;idea&#x27; itself could refuse the &#x27;mimicry command&#x27;.</p>
<p>So I guess it&#x27;s not a scam item after all.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein, who was next to me, looked at my bracelet with envy.</p>
<p>&quot;Sein-ssi, I&#x27;ll get you a nice star relic as well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really? N-No need.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What would you like to have?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heracles&#x27; Shield.&quot;</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>As we walked along, making small talk, we arrived at the platform of Geumho Station.</p>
<p>However, Jung Heewon was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>&quot;Heewon-ssi.......?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, she woke up thirty minutes ago and went to get something to eat with some people earlier.&quot;</p>
<p>Something to eat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was time to worry about that.</p>
<p>I asked Bang Cheolsoo what had happened.</p>
<p>&quot;Did anything happen?&quot;</p>
<p>Judging by the strange looks on their faces, something had happened.</p>
<p>Bang Cheolsoo began his report with a slightly nervous voice.</p>
<p>&quot;A few things happened.&quot;</p>
<p>The first report was about monstrous creatures roaming around Geumho Station.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, they weren&#x27;t monsters nor humans.......&quot;</p>
<p>According to Bang Cheolsoo, the creatures started hanging around a few hours ago.</p>
<p>My mind raced.</p>
<p>&quot;Do they look like rats?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some looked like rats, some looked like lizards.&quot;</p>
<p>I had a vague idea of who they were. Probably incarnations under the command of the</p>
<p>Misreading Association.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything else?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A scenario penalty has been added.&quot;</p>
<p>Scenario. Sure enough, I got a message too.</p>
<p>I hit notifications, and they popped up one after the other.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[A scenario penalty has been added.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[From now on, food stockpiling is limited.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[All existing stockpiled food has disappeared.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The &#x27;survival cost&#x27; clause has been added.]</p>
<p>&#x27;survival cost&#x27;, you will die.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The &#x27;survival cost&#x27; penalty will be maintained until the second main scenario is cleared.]</p>
<p>A food stockpiling ban and a survival cost penalty.</p>
<p>No wonder Jung Heewon went to get food.</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s gather the people for a moment.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite the fact that all the food they had stockpiled was gone, the group didn&#x27;t seem to be in a</p>
<p>desperate mood.</p>
<p>Perhaps because this group had a different starting point than in the 3rd turn.</p>
<p>They shared their food and stuck together in the face of the crisis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;Gather round! The boss is looking for you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come on quickly!&quot;</p>
<p>The scattered, hungry people began to gather one by one.</p>
<p>&quot;Inho ahjussi!&quot;</p>
<p>Dayoung, who was riding on Bang Cheolsoo&#x27;s shoulders, waved at me. As I gently held her</p>
<p>hand, I suddenly remembered Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>He had come to Geumho Station the day I was eaten by the ichthyosaur.</p>
<p>to get food from now on.&quot;」</p>
<p>At that time, Yoo Joonghyuk wasn&#x27;t trying to kill people. Rather, he had come here to save them.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, it didn&#x27;t make sense.</p>
<p>This is the 41st turn.</p>
<p>The world where Yoo Joonghyuk is the most ruthless man of the entire &#x27;Ways of Survival&#x27;.</p>
<p>And yet, he was trying to save these people.</p>
<p>&quot;Inho-ssi?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, yes. Is everyone here?&quot;</p>
<p>Looking around, there were around 80 people.</p>
<p>Judging from the decrease in number, some had left for other areas, except for those who had</p>
<p>followed Jung Heewon to get food.</p>
<p>I started talking.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m guessing you all received a &#x27;survival cost&#x27; penalty.&quot;</p>
<p>A few people reacted to the words survival cost.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right, suddenly we have to pay something every night.......&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How are we supposed to earn those coins?&quot;</p>
<p>I calmly explained.</p>
<p>&quot;Coins can be earned from the sponsorship of the constellations or by completing scenarios.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Scenarios...... That&#x27;s the one we did at the beginning, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do I have to kill people again?&quot;</p>
<p>People&#x27;s eyes filled with fear again.</p>
<p>Most of the people here had already killed people in the first scenario. But few of them killed for</p>
<p>the sake of killing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[The constellation &#x27;Abyssal Black Flame Dragon&#x27; despises the weakness of the incarnations.]</p>
<p>abandoned.]</p>
<p>things.]</p>
<p>The constellations weren&#x27;t wrong.</p>
<p>However, if we train them in such a harsh way, most of them will not survive.</p>
<p>Dayoung pulling Bang Cheolsoo&#x27;s ear, and Dayoung&#x27;s mother admonishing her, wouldn&#x27;t even be</p>
<p>able to survive.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#x27;Dog Who Threw Himself Into the Flames&#x27; understands your intentions.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[A constellation who hasn&#x27;t revealed their modifier pays attention to your choice.]</p>
<p>So this choice was the least I could do for the extras who died without having any chance in</p>
<p>Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>&quot;You would kill people and take their coins, but I don&#x27;t really recommend that, and frankly, I</p>
<p>don&#x27;t think anyone here wants to do that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I-Is there any other way to earn coins?&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded and looked toward the tunnel.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we&#x27;re running out of food...... That&#x27;s good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? Why do you say that.......&quot;</p>
<p>Just then, from the direction of the tunnel, I saw Jung Heewon and other people dragging back</p>
<p>the body of a ground rat.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, Inho-ssi!&quot;</p>
<p>Jung Heewon waved happily, and I waved back.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>&quot;No matter how much I looked for it, there&#x27;s no food, and the ground is covered in poisonous</p>
<p>fog, so I can&#x27;t even go up...... So I brought this, I thought maybe we could eat it.......&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well done.&quot;</p>
<p>I instructed the Cheoldoo Group to carry the body of the ground rat onto the platform.</p>
<p>A few people stumbled back in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;From now on, this is your food.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, we&#x27;re eating this? Do you know what this is.......&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the same meat. Just a different recipe.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I proclaimed myself a &#x27;professional butcher&#x27; and began to strip the meat from the body.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, Kyung Sein, and Dansoo ahjussi began to help me unfazed, probably because</p>
<p>they&#x27;d seen it before.</p>
<p>&quot;Take it in turns!&quot;</p>
<p>Jeong Heewon handed each one a piece of meat.</p>
<p>When everyone had received a piece of meat, I took out the &#x27;Magic Power Stove&#x27; I had obtained</p>
<p>from the &#x27;Edge of Darkness&#x27; from my bosom.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an item called a &#x27;Magic Power Stove&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>I placed the meat I cut on the Magic Power Stove. I increased the power of the stove, and the</p>
<p>meat was deliciously roasted in less than a dozen seconds.</p>
<p>Dayoung muttered in delight.</p>
<p>&quot;Mom, it smells delicious.......&quot;</p>
<p>As I took a piece of meat to demonstrate, people rushed to the Magic Power Stove as if they had</p>
<p>been waiting for it.</p>
<p>After rolling up their sleeves, Bang Cheolsoo and the Cheoldoo Group took over and grilled the</p>
<p>meat for me.</p>
<p>&quot;Does anyone have salt?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hyung-ssi, there&#x27;s no salt here, just eat it!&quot;</p>
<p>Gasps echoed around the room, and for good reason. They hadn&#x27;t touched meat for the past three</p>
<p>days.</p>
<p>But my real purpose was not to feed people full.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The sub scenario &#x27;Food Acquisition&#x27; has been completed early.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[500 coins have been earned.]</p>
<p>The sub scenario &#x27;Food Acquisition&#x27; can only be completed by cooking a &#x27;self-hunted monster&#x27;.</p>
<p>The bodies that Jung Heewon brought back this time were the ones that Kyung Sein, Dansoo</p>
<p>ahjussi and I hunted.</p>
<p>Presumably, the others did not receive the rewards we did.</p>
<p>&quot;From now on, all food must be obtained by hunting monsters.&quot;</p>
<p>At the mention of hunting, the faces of those picking at the meat stiffened.</p>
<p>&quot;For now, I have given you the meat that I and my companions have caught, but it is impossible</p>
<p>to continue this way. You must learn to hunt for yourselves, so you can survive.&quot;</p>
<p>My words were no different than those of Yoo Joonghyuk, who had come here not long before.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He was right, and he was trying to give these people what they needed.</p>
<p>They just weren&#x27;t ready to receive it.</p>
<p>&quot;As you know from reading the scenario, you can earn coins by hunting and cooking your own</p>
<p>ground rats. If you don&#x27;t have any coins right now, you can earn 500 coins by hunting one later</p>
<p>today.&quot;</p>
<p>Those who checked the scenario window at my words said.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s true, it says it will give us coins.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But how are we supposed to catch a monster like this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone, don&#x27;t be scared. I caught one, and so did this ahjussi.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi stepped up to my side to support my words, and I could see a</p>
<p>few people shaking their heads at them.</p>
<p>I quickly added before they could make any negative comments.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ll show you how to catch them.&quot;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi, Kyung Sein, Jung Heewon and I taught the people step by step how to hunt</p>
<p>ground rats.</p>
<p>It was a valuable piece of information that we had to learn with blood, sweat and tears,</p>
<p>something that doesn&#x27;t appear in the text of Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein, who still has bite marks all over her body, squared her shoulders and said.</p>
<p>&quot;Their patterns are very simple. As long as you stay calm, you can easily catch them!&quot;</p>
<p>Although they did bite us a lot for such a simple pattern.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#x27;Commander of the Red Cosmos&#x27; is pleased with your actions.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#x27;Commander of the Red Cosmos&#x27; announces your good deeds.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellations of the &#x27;absolute good&#x27; system approve of your actions.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[1,200 coins have been sponsored.]</p>
<p>In this world, good deeds become coins.</p>
<p>No matter what you do, the results of your actions are directly related to coins.</p>
<p>I wonder if Kim Dokja felt the same way.</p>
<p>However, I didn&#x27;t have time to ponder for long. We were too weak and unprepared for the</p>
<p>scenarios to come.</p>
<p>I could understand why Kim Dokja was so obsessed with coins. Having a lot of coins doesn&#x27;t</p>
<p>mean you can do much right now, but it does give you more options.</p>
<p>Next stop, Chungmuro.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If I wanted to deal with the bald man at Chungmuro, I had to start saving up coins now.</p>
<p>The Ten Evil of Chungmuro Station.</p>
<p>Armed Fortress Master Gong Pildu.</p>
<p>Although he&#x27;s a character with as much presence as hair in the original, Gong Pildu is a pretty</p>
<p>scary villain in the beginning.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Coins Possessed: 11,800 C]</p>
<p>This is a world where even early skills like the [Woryeong Sword Technique] cost 8,000 coins.</p>
<p>With the coins I have now, I don&#x27;t even have enough coins to increase my overall stats, let alone</p>
<p>take care of my companions.</p>
<p>I wish a bunch of coins would fall from the sky. Kim Dokja earns coins just by breathing.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#x27;Lily Blooming in Aquarius&#x27; has entered the channel.]</p>
<p>I looked up at the channel entry notification.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#x27;Lily Blooming in Aquarius&#x27; snoops around Geumho Station.]</p>
<p>Lily Blooming in Aquarius.</p>
<p>Gabriel, the archangel of &lt;Eden&gt;, has entered the channel.</p>
<p>I wondered what brought her to this unknown channel, but somehow, her gaze turned to a certain</p>
<p>place.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#x27;Lily Blooming in Aquarius&#x27; looks at incarnation &#x27;Kyung Sein&#x27;.]</p>
<p>&quot;Not, hold the sword like this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stay still. I&#x27;ll show you.&quot;</p>
<p>Jung Heewon was fixing the frozen Kyung Sein&#x27;s posture.</p>
<p>Even from a distance, I could see that her earlobes were red.</p>
<p>I had forgotten for a moment.</p>
<p>I had forgotten that her original nickname was [Judge Heewon].</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#x27;Lily Blooming in Aquarius&#x27; tilts her head.]</p>
<p>incarnation &#x27;Kyung Sein&#x27;.]</p>
<p>After receiving the coins, Kyung Sein&#x27;s shoulders shook as if wondering what she was thinking.</p>
<p>&quot;L-Like this? Is it okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stretch your arm more, like this.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was a sight that brought blood tears to my eyes, as I had sold my conscience and innocence to</p>
<p>earn coins.</p>
<p>Holy constellation Gabriel.</p>
<p>The person you have now sponsored is actually a muscular man. You are being deceived.</p>
<p>I stood up from my seat, thinking that I should tell my companions to go to Chungmuro.</p>
<p>And the next moment.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#x27;Lily Blooming in Aquarius&#x27; calls her companion.]</p>
<p>My eyes widened at the sight of the name of the constellation entering the channel.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#x27;Demon-Like Judge of Fire&#x27; has entered the channel.]</p>
<p>Author&#x27;s Note</p>
