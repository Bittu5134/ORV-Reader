            <div class="orv_title"><h1>585 Episode 6. Star Relic (2)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Demon King of Salvation-nim! Watcher of Light and Darkness-nim! Please!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Kyung Sein prayed, light exploded from the box.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[An item of unknown origin was placed inside the box.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The box contained a lock of someone's hair.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A hair?</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, wait.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was there a foreign substance mixed in?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The item is causing a strange transformation!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The origin of the sacrificed item is confirmed.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A top-rated item has appeared!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The number of available random item boxes is 0.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After a while, the glow subsided.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, Dansoo ahjussi and I looked at each other, swallowed hard, and opened the box at</p>
<p class="orv_line">the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Inside the box was a vibrant, light-blue colored spirit, about the size of an adult male's fist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein frowned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's changed color? It's like Biyoo's poop."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's check it out."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I went straight for the slime. But just before I reached for it, the slime squirmed and dodged my</p>
<p class="orv_line">hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Upon closer inspection, the slime had eyes. Narrow eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Giw—me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It even had a tiny mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if it looked like me (Cheon Inho).</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Giw—me. Giw—me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein tilted her head.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">"Is it swearing?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, I think it's saying, 'give me'. I think it's asking for food."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How do you know?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Because it's similar to what Jiyoon used to babble......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a moment's hesitation, Dansoo ahjussi worriedly handed over the leftover ground rat meat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The slime looked at it, and then jumped at his hand. It wasn't the ground rat meat that it ate, but</p>
<p class="orv_line">the bracelet he was wearing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi freaked out and jumped back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wilson!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently he'd given the bracelet a name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The slime quickly realized the bracelet was tasteless, spat it out, and curled up with a grunt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the next moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The slime was a bracelet.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After we finished organizing our items, we made our escape from the 'Edge of Darkness'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, ahjussi had a cockroach in his pocket, so it wasn't hard to find our way out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But...... why does the back of my head keep itching?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi, is there something wrong?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, it's just......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I added, peering into the 'Edge of Darkness' where I couldn't see anything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's just that I feel like someone keeps looking at me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, it's just your imagination."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even the bugs say there's nothing there."</p>
<p class="orv_line">If ahjussi says there's nothing there, there's nothing there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this point, the one person he can't detect with his [Diverse Communication] is Killer King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By now, he must be holding the box that has run out of uses with killing intent. I thought of</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King, who was probably repeating 'Cheon Inho' over and over again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well...... at least I didn't give him an empty box, so I guess it's okay.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he makes good use of the notes I put in the box, he'll still get a decent income.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, whatever he gets will be less than the bracelet on my wrist.</p>

<p><Item Information></p>
<p>Name: Idea of Almost Anything</p>
<p>Rating: Star Relic (遺物)</p>
<p>Description: A mysterious slime that was once the product of a constellation's obsession of</p>
<p>studying 'almost everything'.</p>
<p>When worn, it increases Agility and Magic Power levels by 1 each.</p>
<p>* 'Idea' can use 'mimicry'.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Formed Idea (意態).</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Idea of Almost Anything' can mimic an item by touching it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since it's a top-rated item, it cannot mimic others simply by touching them, but only after certain</p>
<p class="orv_line">conditions are met.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Once successfully mimicked, the item can be used continuously until the mimicked form is</p>
<p class="orv_line">destroyed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the 'Idea of Almost Anything' may, out of its own free will, refuse to obey its owner's</p>
<p class="orv_line">'mimicry command'.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>As you can probably tell from the description, this was a scam item. In theory, it could be almost</p>
<p>anything.</p>
<p>However, 'Idea of Almost Anything' had two fatal flaws.</p>
<p>One is that you can't rely on it if you don't meet the 'mimicry' conditions.</p>
<p>And the second was that the 'idea' itself could refuse the 'mimicry command'.</p>
<p>So I guess it's not a scam item after all.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein, who was next to me, looked at my bracelet with envy.</p>
<p>"Sein-ssi, I'll get you a nice star relic as well."</p>
<p>"Really? N-No need."</p>
<p>"What would you like to have?"</p>
<p>"Heracles' Shield."</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>As we walked along, making small talk, we arrived at the platform of Geumho Station.</p>
<p>However, Jung Heewon was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>"Heewon-ssi.......?"</p>
<p>"Oh, she woke up thirty minutes ago and went to get something to eat with some people earlier."</p>
<p>Something to eat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was time to worry about that.</p>
<p>I asked Bang Cheolsoo what had happened.</p>
<p>"Did anything happen?"</p>
<p>Judging by the strange looks on their faces, something had happened.</p>
<p>Bang Cheolsoo began his report with a slightly nervous voice.</p>
<p>"A few things happened."</p>
<p>The first report was about monstrous creatures roaming around Geumho Station.</p>
<p>"Well, they weren't monsters nor humans......."</p>
<p>According to Bang Cheolsoo, the creatures started hanging around a few hours ago.</p>
<p>My mind raced.</p>
<p>"Do they look like rats?"</p>
<p>"Some looked like rats, some looked like lizards."</p>
<p>I had a vague idea of who they were. Probably incarnations under the command of the</p>
<p>Misreading Association.</p>
<p>"Anything else?"</p>
<p>"A scenario penalty has been added."</p>
<p>Scenario. Sure enough, I got a message too.</p>
<p>I hit notifications, and they popped up one after the other.</p>
<p><!>[A scenario penalty has been added.]</p>
<p><!>[From now on, food stockpiling is limited.]</p>
<p><!>[All existing stockpiled food has disappeared.]</p>
<p><!>[The 'survival cost' clause has been added.]</p>
<p>'survival cost', you will die.]</p>
<p><!>[The 'survival cost' penalty will be maintained until the second main scenario is cleared.]</p>
<p>A food stockpiling ban and a survival cost penalty.</p>
<p>No wonder Jung Heewon went to get food.</p>
<p>"Let's gather the people for a moment."</p>
<p>Despite the fact that all the food they had stockpiled was gone, the group didn't seem to be in a</p>
<p>desperate mood.</p>
<p>Perhaps because this group had a different starting point than in the 3rd turn.</p>
<p>They shared their food and stuck together in the face of the crisis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Gather round! The boss is looking for you!"</p>
<p>"Come on quickly!"</p>
<p>The scattered, hungry people began to gather one by one.</p>
<p>"Inho ahjussi!"</p>
<p>Dayoung, who was riding on Bang Cheolsoo's shoulders, waved at me. As I gently held her</p>
<p>hand, I suddenly remembered Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>He had come to Geumho Station the day I was eaten by the ichthyosaur.</p>
<p>to get food from now on."」</p>
<p>At that time, Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't trying to kill people. Rather, he had come here to save them.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, it didn't make sense.</p>
<p>This is the 41st turn.</p>
<p>The world where Yoo Joonghyuk is the most ruthless man of the entire 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p>And yet, he was trying to save these people.</p>
<p>"Inho-ssi?"</p>
<p>"Ah, yes. Is everyone here?"</p>
<p>Looking around, there were around 80 people.</p>
<p>Judging from the decrease in number, some had left for other areas, except for those who had</p>
<p>followed Jung Heewon to get food.</p>
<p>I started talking.</p>
<p>"I'm guessing you all received a 'survival cost' penalty."</p>
<p>A few people reacted to the words survival cost.</p>
<p>"That's right, suddenly we have to pay something every night......."</p>
<p>"How are we supposed to earn those coins?"</p>
<p>I calmly explained.</p>
<p>"Coins can be earned from the sponsorship of the constellations or by completing scenarios."</p>
<p>"Scenarios...... That's the one we did at the beginning, right?"</p>
<p>"Do I have to kill people again?"</p>
<p>People's eyes filled with fear again.</p>
<p>Most of the people here had already killed people in the first scenario. But few of them killed for</p>
<p>the sake of killing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' despises the weakness of the incarnations.]</p>
<p>abandoned.]</p>
<p>things.]</p>
<p>The constellations weren't wrong.</p>
<p>However, if we train them in such a harsh way, most of them will not survive.</p>
<p>Dayoung pulling Bang Cheolsoo's ear, and Dayoung's mother admonishing her, wouldn't even be</p>
<p>able to survive.</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Dog Who Threw Himself Into the Flames' understands your intentions.]</p>
<p><!>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier pays attention to your choice.]</p>
<p>So this choice was the least I could do for the extras who died without having any chance in</p>
<p>Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>"You would kill people and take their coins, but I don't really recommend that, and frankly, I</p>
<p>don't think anyone here wants to do that."</p>
<p>"I-Is there any other way to earn coins?"</p>
<p>I nodded and looked toward the tunnel.</p>
<p>"Well, we're running out of food...... That's good."</p>
<p>"What? Why do you say that......."</p>
<p>Just then, from the direction of the tunnel, I saw Jung Heewon and other people dragging back</p>
<p>the body of a ground rat.</p>
<p>"Ah, Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p>Jung Heewon waved happily, and I waved back.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"No matter how much I looked for it, there's no food, and the ground is covered in poisonous</p>
<p>fog, so I can't even go up...... So I brought this, I thought maybe we could eat it......."</p>
<p>"Well done."</p>
<p>I instructed the Cheoldoo Group to carry the body of the ground rat onto the platform.</p>
<p>A few people stumbled back in surprise.</p>
<p>"From now on, this is your food."</p>
<p>"What, we're eating this? Do you know what this is......."</p>
<p>"It's the same meat. Just a different recipe."</p>
<p></p>
<p>I proclaimed myself a 'professional butcher' and began to strip the meat from the body.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, Kyung Sein, and Dansoo ahjussi began to help me unfazed, probably because</p>
<p>they'd seen it before.</p>
<p>"Take it in turns!"</p>
<p>Jeong Heewon handed each one a piece of meat.</p>
<p>When everyone had received a piece of meat, I took out the 'Magic Power Stove' I had obtained</p>
<p>from the 'Edge of Darkness' from my bosom.</p>
<p>"This is an item called a 'Magic Power Stove'."</p>
<p>I placed the meat I cut on the Magic Power Stove. I increased the power of the stove, and the</p>
<p>meat was deliciously roasted in less than a dozen seconds.</p>
<p>Dayoung muttered in delight.</p>
<p>"Mom, it smells delicious......."</p>
<p>As I took a piece of meat to demonstrate, people rushed to the Magic Power Stove as if they had</p>
<p>been waiting for it.</p>
<p>After rolling up their sleeves, Bang Cheolsoo and the Cheoldoo Group took over and grilled the</p>
<p>meat for me.</p>
<p>"Does anyone have salt?"</p>
<p>"Hyung-ssi, there's no salt here, just eat it!"</p>
<p>Gasps echoed around the room, and for good reason. They hadn't touched meat for the past three</p>
<p>days.</p>
<p>But my real purpose was not to feed people full.</p>
<p><!>[The sub scenario 'Food Acquisition' has been completed early.]</p>
<p><!>[500 coins have been earned.]</p>
<p>The sub scenario 'Food Acquisition' can only be completed by cooking a 'self-hunted monster'.</p>
<p>The bodies that Jung Heewon brought back this time were the ones that Kyung Sein, Dansoo</p>
<p>ahjussi and I hunted.</p>
<p>Presumably, the others did not receive the rewards we did.</p>
<p>"From now on, all food must be obtained by hunting monsters."</p>
<p>At the mention of hunting, the faces of those picking at the meat stiffened.</p>
<p>"For now, I have given you the meat that I and my companions have caught, but it is impossible</p>
<p>to continue this way. You must learn to hunt for yourselves, so you can survive."</p>
<p>My words were no different than those of Yoo Joonghyuk, who had come here not long before.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He was right, and he was trying to give these people what they needed.</p>
<p>They just weren't ready to receive it.</p>
<p>"As you know from reading the scenario, you can earn coins by hunting and cooking your own</p>
<p>ground rats. If you don't have any coins right now, you can earn 500 coins by hunting one later</p>
<p>today."</p>
<p>Those who checked the scenario window at my words said.</p>
<p>"It's true, it says it will give us coins."</p>
<p>"But how are we supposed to catch a monster like this?"</p>
<p>"Everyone, don't be scared. I caught one, and so did this ahjussi."</p>
<p>Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi stepped up to my side to support my words, and I could see a</p>
<p>few people shaking their heads at them.</p>
<p>I quickly added before they could make any negative comments.</p>
<p>"We'll show you how to catch them."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Dansoo ahjussi, Kyung Sein, Jung Heewon and I taught the people step by step how to hunt</p>
<p>ground rats.</p>
<p>It was a valuable piece of information that we had to learn with blood, sweat and tears,</p>
<p>something that doesn't appear in the text of Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein, who still has bite marks all over her body, squared her shoulders and said.</p>
<p>"Their patterns are very simple. As long as you stay calm, you can easily catch them!"</p>
<p>Although they did bite us a lot for such a simple pattern.</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is pleased with your actions.]</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' announces your good deeds.]</p>
<p><!>[The constellations of the 'absolute good' system approve of your actions.]</p>
<p><!>[1,200 coins have been sponsored.]</p>
<p>In this world, good deeds become coins.</p>
<p>No matter what you do, the results of your actions are directly related to coins.</p>
<p>I wonder if Kim Dokja felt the same way.</p>
<p>However, I didn't have time to ponder for long. We were too weak and unprepared for the</p>
<p>scenarios to come.</p>
<p>I could understand why Kim Dokja was so obsessed with coins. Having a lot of coins doesn't</p>
<p>mean you can do much right now, but it does give you more options.</p>
<p>Next stop, Chungmuro.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If I wanted to deal with the bald man at Chungmuro, I had to start saving up coins now.</p>
<p>The Ten Evil of Chungmuro Station.</p>
<p>Armed Fortress Master Gong Pildu.</p>
<p>Although he's a character with as much presence as hair in the original, Gong Pildu is a pretty</p>
<p>scary villain in the beginning.</p>
<p><!>[Coins Possessed: 11,800 C]</p>
<p>This is a world where even early skills like the [Woryeong Sword Technique] cost 8,000 coins.</p>
<p>With the coins I have now, I don't even have enough coins to increase my overall stats, let alone</p>
<p>take care of my companions.</p>
<p>I wish a bunch of coins would fall from the sky. Kim Dokja earns coins just by breathing.</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' has entered the channel.]</p>
<p>I looked up at the channel entry notification.</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' snoops around Geumho Station.]</p>
<p>Lily Blooming in Aquarius.</p>
<p>Gabriel, the archangel of <Eden>, has entered the channel.</p>
<p>I wondered what brought her to this unknown channel, but somehow, her gaze turned to a certain</p>
<p>place.</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' looks at incarnation 'Kyung Sein'.]</p>
<p>"Not, hold the sword like this."</p>
<p>"Like this?"</p>
<p>"Stay still. I'll show you."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon was fixing the frozen Kyung Sein's posture.</p>
<p>Even from a distance, I could see that her earlobes were red.</p>
<p>I had forgotten for a moment.</p>
<p>I had forgotten that her original nickname was [Judge Heewon].</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' tilts her head.]</p>
<p>incarnation 'Kyung Sein'.]</p>
<p>After receiving the coins, Kyung Sein's shoulders shook as if wondering what she was thinking.</p>
<p>"L-Like this? Is it okay?"</p>
<p>"Stretch your arm more, like this."</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was a sight that brought blood tears to my eyes, as I had sold my conscience and innocence to</p>
<p>earn coins.</p>
<p>Holy constellation Gabriel.</p>
<p>The person you have now sponsored is actually a muscular man. You are being deceived.</p>
<p>I stood up from my seat, thinking that I should tell my companions to go to Chungmuro.</p>
<p>And the next moment.</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' calls her companion.]</p>
<p>My eyes widened at the sight of the name of the constellation entering the channel.</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire' has entered the channel.]</p>
