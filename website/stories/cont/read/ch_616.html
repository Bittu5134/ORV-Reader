            <div class="orv_title"><h1>616 Episode 12 □□ (7)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung sat down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no more blood in the man's hands. The sentences that flowed like powder from his fingertips were whispering in her ears.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 He was once Kim Dokja. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It couldn't be.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, no matter how many times she shook her head and denied it, the reality in front of her did not change.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 49% of Kim Dokja cut with her own hands. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When the fragments of Kim Dokja were scattered into space, she thought that there might be such an existence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps Kim Dok-ja, whom she thought of as an [Avatar], was also reincarnated as a small fragment and was reincarnated on the far side of the universe.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Oh, my son is great." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In that universe, he will live a new life under a new name.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Honey, I guess he likes books. He will become a scholar, right?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Unlike Kim Dokja, he would have grown up in a warm family and been loved by his parents.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Ahhhhhh." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He must have cried after losing his first love.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Kuu. Kut. Kut. Love... only makes people weak." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He must have made a dark history by radiating his youth to his heart's content…</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 What is Lee Hakhyun’s dream? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps he would have found his new dream as well.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "A writer." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He would have worked towards that dream.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Announcement of the winners of the 24th Rookie of the Year Award, the winning work Origin of Memory: Author Lee Hakhyun.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At times, he would have despaired of bumping into the limits of reality.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I'm sorry, author. As you know, the paper book market isn't good these days..." 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "How about writing a web novel? These days, that's..." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, he never gave up on his dream.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Writer. You can't write like this. Did you read the lines you wrote out loud?" 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I... Can I make a living by writing?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As a reward for not giving up on his dream, he faced the man of his dreams.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "You look like a web novel writer." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, he reached the origins of his lost self.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Editor. I guess I have an idea in mind." 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "What is the title of this new work?" 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 It’s 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung read and re-read his stories that were infrequently cut off.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is the one who refused to be reborn as Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The one who helped his comrades find his lost memories together.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man who was once a reader who forgot this story</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I also want to have my own story." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Now, he's a writer and he's back into the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung held his hand for a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wake up."</p>
<p class="orv_line">His limp body swayed helplessly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You didn't come here to die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was not a wound that could be healed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"After all that hardship, you left to find the life you wanted."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did he have to come back here again?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung did not know the answer. Perhaps the answer will have to be found out by Lee Hakhyun himself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead, Han Sooyoung recalled all the sentences of 'Ways of Survival' she knew and of 'Omniscient Reader'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, no matter how much she thought about it, there was no way to heal his wounds in this world now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung, breathing lightly, raised her head. She stared into the darkness for a while, as if looking for a star in the night sky, then put her hand inside her coat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsutsutsutsu.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The &lt;Star Stream&gt; looks at you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some nebulae watch your actions.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some constellations are wary of your actions!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Administration Bureau determines the 「Probability Conformity」 of your actions!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The channel fluctuated violently, and the foreshadowing of a probable aftermath was felt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the &lt;Star Stream&gt;, there is much more chance of killing someone than saving someone. Moreover, if death is already confirmed, there is no need to mention it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Moments later, a small pill was held in Han Sooyoung's hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Life and Death Pill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is the ultimate medicine created by Lee Seolhwa, and an item that does not yet exist in this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She didn't know that she would use the emergency medicine she had brought with her.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many constellations doubt the existence of the item you took out.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Bureau prepares for scenario intervention!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps if she uses this item, she will face the aftermath of probability.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because it is an item that should not exist in this world right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It wasn't an [avatar] to sacrifice here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung pushed the Life and Death Pill into Lee Hakhyun's mouth. Along with the cozy warmth, soon his whole body was dyed with a soft light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She had something to ask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But now she had no time. With white sparks, her avatar faded little by little. The aftermath of probability began to roll in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the last moment, she squeezed the lemon candy in Lee Hakhyun's hand and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Tell him that I received it well."</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Soft snowflakes brushed my cheeks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I opened my eyes and faced the pure white sky, I immediately realized where this place was.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Kim Dokja! 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As I jumped up and shouted, the voice I had been waiting for came from behind.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I’m here. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the middle of the snowy field, Kim Dokja was squatting and reading something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ways of Survival, is it? Or has someone written a new novel in the meantime?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I remembered that thought, I felt like I wanted to die.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The lemon candy. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Sorry, I couldn’t keep my promise."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja laughed wordlessly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked around with a feeling of embarrassment</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I couldn't help it. My pride as a writer was also hurt.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 How was Han Soo-young? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a while and replied.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 She was strong. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja fought against such a Han Sooyoung several times. After fighting and fighting, they eventually became friends.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 And, she was an excellent writer. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Feeling a bit relieved, I added a word.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Honestly, I felt like I didn’t need to be in that world line. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The theater dungeon has been cleared, and my work is done.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it were Han Sooyoung, even after seeing my death, she wouldn't insist on the same ending as before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it's her, she'll find a way somehow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An ending that won't seal Yoo Jonghyuk or sacrifice the readers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The way I couldn't find, she will find it.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Han Sooyoung doesn’t seem to think so. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Huh?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered what that meant. Is it because of fatigue? My head didn't work properly.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Because this is your story. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly felt dizzy.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I’m just an extra villain. All I've done in the meantime was to incite myself to be someone other than myself. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">While the scenario lasted, I had to become Kim Dokja several times, and Yoo Jonghyuk. I've been through the scenario like that, and I died in the end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps, it's because I wasn't the real Kim Dokja or Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 You are Lee Hakhyun. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know why, but the moment I heard those words, I felt like crying.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 As well as Cheon Inho. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 ... 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Your name is not important. The important thing is that we are talking about yourself there. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I think I've heard something similar somewhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I can't remember who told me about it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little by little, my consciousness began to fade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it because I will die soon?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked Kim Dokja, enduring sleepiness.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 You… 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to ask, but I didn't know what to ask. Because there are so many things I want to ask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">You said it wasn't hard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Didn't you want to quit that long scenario, story, enduring the years?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why didn't you go back to your party members yet?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja opened his mouth.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 There is a spell I say out loud when I am having a hard time. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I knew what the sentence was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We said at the same time.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I am Yoo Joonghyuk. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The name is not important.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I felt like I could understand what he was saying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the first place, we endured our lives by borrowing each other's stories over and over again.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I tried that too, but it didn’t really make me become Yoo Jonghyuk. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 That's right. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't forget the look on Kim Dokja's face as he said those words and nodded.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 But after saying that, I felt a little more like Kim Dokja. 」</p></div>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my eyes with the dizzying pain felt throughout my body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed that I should use the sentence I just heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“I am Yoo Joonghyuk.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">No incite was used. Even so, I felt a little energized.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Breathing out and raising my upper body, I saw the roof of the theater dungeon in ruins.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a faint magical power drifting from around my heart. My chest, which had obviously been pierced, was sprouting new flesh as if it had never happened.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I lived. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't figure out how this could be possible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Obviously, I fought with Han Sooyoung and died from being pierced through the chest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The last sentence I wrote ended with my death. The title of the scene was Death of the Villain, so that was an irreplaceable fact.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Still, I was alive. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Something slid down my shoulder with a gurgling sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the white coat Han Sooyoung was wearing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Holding onto the coat, I stood up and looked around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw Yoo Jonghyuk and Jung Heewon, who had lost consciousness. Both of them seemed to have stable breathing, so no serious injuries seemed likely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Where did Han Sooyoung go?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The dawn was coming soon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A cluster of meteors crossed the border of the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It belatedly reminded me that this was the theater dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja and his colleagues must have seen that scene too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The words of Kim Dokja, who had been watching the meteor shower with infinitely cold eyes, were finally felt through my skin.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The scenario has just begun. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I just hit my third main scenario and lost my life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The cold sense of death was still vivid in my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was lucky enough to survive this time, but will I be able to do that again next time?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The scenarios to come were so terrifying that they could not even be compared to the theater dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will the readers who came with me be able to endure all the trials and survive?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Because this is your story. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Can I protect them?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I put my hand on my forehead in the feeling of dizziness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could hear people's footsteps in the distance. After the scenario ended, the people who escaped from the movie were climbing up to the rooftop one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, the door on the roof burst open, someone took the first step and asked me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I carelessly looked around, but Kim Dokja was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Understanding came a little too late.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The strong dawn backlight behind me. A deep shadow cast over my face. The exterior reinforced suit worn by Kim Dokja in the original hand with his face pressed against his face with dizziness..</p>
<p class="orv_line">And a white coat in my hand. I seemed to know what they had seen and misunderstood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I laughed and tried to say that I was not Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the moment I saw the faces of people who looked like they were about to collapse, all the words inside me lost their power and disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">People who read stories and loved stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were people who watched the stories of their favorite characters and endured life with joy or sorrow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I heard people behind me asking the people who came through the door first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey, Kim Dokja?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja? Really?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Desperate words from deep despair.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Beyond the door they opened, they hoped that there would be the Kim Dokja they were looking for.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 That moment. I understood Kim Dokja. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of a small meteorite falling in the distance was heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quietly looked down at the coat Han Sooyoung had left behind.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I am a writer, Lee Hakhyun. Instigator Cheon Inho. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps this is something only I can do.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Thoughts about almost everything' mimicked with 'Ever-changing Stealth Suit'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I quietly closed my eyes and recalled a man's face.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The effect of 'Ever-changing Stealth Suit' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A man who grinned at people with a blank face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A person who wanted to see the epilogue of a novel while knowing the end of this world alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The protagonist of this story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A white coat fluttered in the wind that blew over the building.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I completely removed my hands from my face, the people who saw my face burst into tears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It was, really, really, really."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I told you! I knew there would be!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just by confirming someone's existence, hope was blooming on people's faces.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">At one time, when I heard that name, one side of my chest hurt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But now it wasn't like that.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Still, this world needs Kim Dokja. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know if there really is Kim Dokja in this world or not.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Nevertheless, this is still a story about Kim Dokja. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, lying is what I do best.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled bitterly and waved at people.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 However, it is not a story about only one Kim Dokja. 」</p></div>
