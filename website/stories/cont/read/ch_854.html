            <div class="orv_title"><h1>854 Episode 46 Big Joke (5)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Strength and strength. Will and will. Stories and stories clashed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a great clash of light that I had never seen before. Something flashed before my eyes, and my vision briefly blacked out and then came back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone screamed. The sound of gasping for breath. The smell of something burning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And when I opened my eyes again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Supreme King!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw Anna Croft, who had been rolling around in the dust, reaching out her hand towards me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What happened?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Stories poured out of Yoo Joonghyuk&#39;s mouth. I had an ominous feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn it, did I fail?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You succeeded.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if he had read my mind, Yoo Joonghyuk answered calmly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Zeus&#39;s lightning, which had spread like fog, dispersed, and an empty hole was visible in the air. The trace of the Soul-Destructing Spear tearing through space. Between the sparks of lightning that were flying, I saw Zeus&#39;s incarnation with one arm and side blown off.</p>
[The constellation, &#39;Seat of Lightning&#39;, received a great shock to his incarnation body!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With Yoo Joonghyuk&#39;s words, I released [Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint]. As my soul returned to my body, sparks rippled throughout my body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With strength in my aching muscles, I staggered toward the passage on the other side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Zeus, who had found me like that, unleashed an electric shock with his half-remaining incarnation. Yoo Joonghyuk stepped forward and blocked the electric shock. Even as his skin burned black, the guy didn&#39;t take his eyes off me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Go quickly! I can&#39;t hold out for long!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course. Even if he was half Zeus, he was still a myth-grade. He wasn&#39;t someone Yoo Joonghyuk could face to buy time on his own. He was even protected by the &#39;Giant Nebula&#39;. Anna Croft, standing next to Yoo Joonghyuk who was swearing with bloodshot eyes, joined in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Go, Cheon Inho.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Anna Croft pushed herself that far, it must mean that she could somehow hold out with [Future Sight].</p>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately activated [Way of the Wind] and started running.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—No matter what happens in the middle, just keep running until the end. There is a power room at the end of the straight line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I believed Yoo Joonghyuk&#39;s words and ran.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Indeed, when I reached the middle of the hallway, the surrounding scenery changed and a new world unfolded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;The Last Ark&#39; is a stage that gathers the &#39;great tales&#39; of each nebula. So it was inevitable that various worldviews would be mixed up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While running through the hallway, I ran through Tartarus of the &lt;Underworld&gt;, ran through the temple of &lt;Olympus&gt;, and crossed Bifrost of &lt;Asgard&gt;.</p>
[Chase! Catch him!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Soon after, constellations chasing me appeared from somewhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did they break through Yoo Joonghyuk and Anna Croft?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of Zeus&#39;s lightning that could be heard from afar was also gradually getting closer. For a moment, my vision flashed, and someone pushed me away and took the lightning instead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Go, disciple.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When on earth did they enter the ark?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheok Jungyeong and Kyrgios were there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you&#39;re my disciple, you can run faster than that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded at Kyrgios&#39;s words.</p>
[The story &#39;Heir of the Eternal Name&#39; begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as Kim Dokja&#39;s story came to me, [Bookmark] was activated in my head. I immediately put &#39;Kyrgios Roadgrim&#39; in the bookmark.</p>
「Big and small ultimately depend on the perception of existence, so the existence that can freely control that cognitive realm is the greatest.」</p></div>
[&#39;Bookmark&#39; is activated!]</p></div>
[Your understanding of the person in question is considerable!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Is it worth listening to the difficult words so far?</p>
[Your enlightenment increases due to the effect of &#39;Abstruse Murim Dumplings&#39;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Or, it may be the effect of the strange dumplings I ate then.</p>
[The level of the person in question is too high to fully reproduce the skill.]</p></div>
[The level of the skill being activated is forcibly adjusted.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja&#39;s main skill. Baekcheong&#39;s bright light soon covered my entire body.</p>
[The exclusive skill, &#39;Full Personification Lv. 10&#39;, is activated.]</p></div>
[Your current physical composition is different from that of the character.]</p></div>
[Your current physical composition cannot use &#39;Full Electrification.]</p></div>
[A powerful skill penalty is eating away at your body!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I see. [Full Electrification] is a skill that only &quot;dwarves&quot; can use.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However.</p>
[Your &#39;status&#39; overcomes the skill penalty!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If the caster&#39;s &#39;Strength&#39; exceeds a certain level, even non-dwarves can temporarily use [Full Personification].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kugugugugugu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even with destructive power several times its original value.</p>
[Kuaaaaak!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations that were blocking my path fell away like moths, burning.</p>
[What, what is that!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Since I had already exhausted my mental power with [Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint], the time I could maintain [Full Electrification] was less than 10 seconds. However, I was able to move quite a distance in just those 10 seconds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kuduk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho&#39;s knees buckled as he could not withstand the power of [Full Electrification]. The [Bookmark] disappeared. I limped on my injured knee and continued to run.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were not swept away by the storm of [Full Electrification]. The constellations began to rush toward me again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I still couldn&#39;t see the powerhouse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What should I do? Should I use [Incite]? Or should I use [Bookmark] again? If not—</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Come to your senses. You who deceived the stars.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man who said those words was an unexpected person. He supported me and walked about fifteen steps, then blasted the constellations that were rushing toward me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you die, the last of humanity will die too. Do you intend to make my efforts go to waste?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was the Blood Demon who had been resurrected by my [Deceased Summoning].</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Blood Demon&#39;s corpses that had entered the ark together rushed toward the constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even as his arms flew away and his thighs burst, the Blood Demon did not give up and shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Go. Go and prove that humanity has survived until the end.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then came the sound of the Blood Demon&#39;s corpses being torn apart. Lightning strikes continued to strike from the angry sky. At that moment, I thought that I could not avoid it this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Evil sophist.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time, someone carried me. At the same time, the falling lightning lost its way and scattered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;My ability here can only last 5 minutes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo, the &#39;Disappearing One&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His skill of making existence disappear finally shone in the last scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Ten Evils that I had revived just before coming here were there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who was guarding the path I had walked, shouting. Lee Dansu, who was setting up a trap. Kang Ilhun, who was spreading false rumors, saying, &quot;Cheon Inho ran away in the opposite direction!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, a small door appeared at the end of the hallway.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo, whose skill&#39;s duration had ended, put me down and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It was a good thing I didn&#39;t disappear this time.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Leaving these words behind, Ye Hyunwoo fought against the constellations with the remaining Ten Evils.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at the backs of the Ten Evils for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Has Cheon Inho seen the same scenery as me? What is the guy who pushed me into this fault thinking as he reads this story?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Soon, the cold handle felt in my hand.</p>
[The &#39;myth-grade constellations&#39; belonging to the final ark are astonished!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The ecstatic smell of stories is felt as soon as the door is opened. The &#39;power source&#39; that condensed the most dazzling stories of this world line was glowing yellow in the center of the room. It was the &#39;story core&#39; that I had been looking for.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Without hesitation, I reached out to the story core.</p>
[You have acquired the &#39;story core&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If I destroy this, the last scenario will end.</p>
[Some &#39;myth-grade constellations&#39; try to persuade you!]</p></div>
[The giant nebula, &lt;Asgard&gt;, wants to offer you a chance to &#39;board the ark&#39;!]</p></div>
[The giant nebula, &lt;Veda&gt;, offers you a piece of &lt;Locapala&gt;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<p class="orv_line">The messages from the myth-grade constellations surged into my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If I was going to stop here, I wouldn&#39;t have even started.&quot;</p>
[Many &#39;myth-grade constellations&#39; say that if you don’t stop right now…!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I struck the story core with all my might. Perhaps because it was a condensed story, the core didn’t break easily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I struck it, and struck it again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story core began to crack little by little.</p>
[The constellation, &#39;Lightning Seat&#39;, spews out his terrifying rage at you!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Zeus&#39;s lightning bolt belatedly pierced through the engine room and exploded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I laughed even as I felt the pain of my body burning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s too late, you son of a bitch.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I struck the core for the last time, there was a sound of something breaking. The enormous story that the constellations had gathered to cross world lines was released, and a pillar of light rose toward the sky.</p>
[Someone has achieved the clear condition of the &#39;Last Scenario&#39;!]</p></div>
[The &lt;Star Stream&gt;&#39;s probability changes drastically!]</p></div>
[The entrance to the sealed wall opens!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When I blinked again, I was in a completely different place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A huge wall of text surrounded my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized where I was.</p>
「He couldn&#39;t tell if it was his thoughts or a record written on the wall. However, what was certain was that everything he thought, said, and did was written on the wall in front of him.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I had finally arrived.</p>
「The &#39;Final Wall&#39; was there.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly placed my hand on the wall and the [Fourth Wall] reacted.</p>
[The exclusive skill, &#39;Fourth Wall&#39;, activates!]</p></div>
[The &#39;Final Wall&#39; accepts your presence.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My body seemed to be seeping in like a fluid, and before I knew it, I was inside the wall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked around, steadying my staggering body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A room made up of dazzlingly glowing hologram monitors. It was a room I knew, a room I had experienced well.</p>
「The &#39;Dokkaebi King&#39; was there.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was dozens of times the size of an average dokkaebi. No matter how I looked at it, it looked extremely obese.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder what it had been eating right before I came in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy who had been chewing something in his mouth turned his huge head and looked at me.</p>
[Huh? What is it.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The eyes of the one who had watched the &#39;scenarios&#39; the longest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was momentarily overwhelmed by that gaze and lost my words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Dokkaebi King slowly got up from his seat and stood in front of me with his belly rippling, then lowered his head and began to observe me.</p>
[How did you get here? This is not a place you are allowed to be?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Dokkaebi King&#39;s large fingers touched my head. Even though my body would explode if I were crushed, I couldn&#39;t move a finger.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A spark lightly shot up and an interested expression appeared on the Dokkaebi King&#39;s face.</p>
[Look at this. This isn&#39;t a normal worldline.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With just one finger, the Dokkaebi King seemed to understand how I existed here.</p>
[Using real life to create elaborate fakes. How could you… I see. You.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With a small exclamation, the Dokkaebi King nodded.</p>
[You are a being who &#39;can&#39;t help but do that&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I tried to open my mouth somehow. I tried to ask something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But my lips wouldn&#39;t open. As if &#39;this story after this has all been decided&#39;, my body didn&#39;t move at all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if he had guessed my state, the Dokkaebi King smiled.</p>
[Everything is already written, and is being written at the same time. You came to confirm the &#39;true ending&#39; of this world line.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Dokkaebi King smiled kindly and handed me a story fragment.</p>
[This is what you were looking for. Small and amazing star.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And the moment I held the story, the stage of the world went dark.</p>
[You have successfully cleared all the tasks of the &#39;Time Fault&#39;!]</p></div>
[All the &#39;Recorders of Fear&#39; sigh at your amazing interpretation.]</p></div>
[The &#39;Recorders of Fear&#39; are discussing your interpretation reward.]</p></div>
[The &#39;King of Fear&#39; rises from the throne.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
[■■-level Fear, the &#39;Final Chapter&#39; of the &#39;Evil Sophist&#39; is playing.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The old ending of the 40th round began to be written on the &#39;Final Wall&#39;.</p>
