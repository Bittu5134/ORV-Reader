<p class="orv_line">Strength and strength. Will and will. Stories and stories clashed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a great clash of light that I had never seen before. Something flashed before my eyes, and my vision briefly blacked out and then came back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone screamed. The sound of gasping for breath. The smell of something burning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And when I opened my eyes again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Supreme King!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw Anna Croft, who had been rolling around in the dust, reaching out her hand towards me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What happened?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Stories poured out of Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s mouth. I had an ominous feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn it, did I fail?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You succeeded.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if he had read my mind, Yoo Joonghyuk answered calmly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Zeus&#x27;s lightning, which had spread like fog, dispersed, and an empty hole was visible in the air. The trace of the Soul-Destructing Spear tearing through space. Between the sparks of lightning that were flying, I saw Zeus&#x27;s incarnation with one arm and side blown off.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, &#x27;Seat of Lightning&#x27;, received a great shock to his incarnation body!]</div>[The constellation, 'Seat of Lightning', received a great shock to his incarnation body!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s words, I released [Omniscient Reader&#x27;s Viewpoint]. As my soul returned to my body, sparks rippled throughout my body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With strength in my aching muscles, I staggered toward the passage on the other side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Zeus, who had found me like that, unleashed an electric shock with his half-remaining incarnation. Yoo Joonghyuk stepped forward and blocked the electric shock. Even as his skin burned black, the guy didn&#x27;t take his eyes off me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Go quickly! I can&#x27;t hold out for long!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course. Even if he was half Zeus, he was still a myth-grade. He wasn&#x27;t someone Yoo Joonghyuk could face to buy time on his own. He was even protected by the &#x27;Giant Nebula&#x27;. Anna Croft, standing next to Yoo Joonghyuk who was swearing with bloodshot eyes, joined in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Go, Cheon Inho.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Anna Croft pushed herself that far, it must mean that she could somehow hold out with [Future Sight].</p>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately activated [Way of the Wind] and started running.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—No matter what happens in the middle, just keep running until the end. There is a power room at the end of the straight line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I believed Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s words and ran.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Indeed, when I reached the middle of the hallway, the surrounding scenery changed and a new world unfolded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;The Last Ark&#x27; is a stage that gathers the &#x27;great tales&#x27; of each nebula. So it was inevitable that various worldviews would be mixed up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While running through the hallway, I ran through Tartarus of the &lt;Underworld&gt;, ran through the temple of &lt;Olympus&gt;, and crossed Bifrost of &lt;Asgard&gt;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Chase! Catch him!]</div>[Chase! Catch him!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Soon after, constellations chasing me appeared from somewhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did they break through Yoo Joonghyuk and Anna Croft?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of Zeus&#x27;s lightning that could be heard from afar was also gradually getting closer. For a moment, my vision flashed, and someone pushed me away and took the lightning instead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Go, disciple.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When on earth did they enter the ark?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheok Jungyeong and Kyrgios were there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you&#x27;re my disciple, you can run faster than that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded at Kyrgios&#x27;s words.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;Heir of the Eternal Name&#x27; begins its storytelling.]</div>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as Kim Dokja&#x27;s story came to me, [Bookmark] was activated in my head. I immediately put &#x27;Kyrgios Roadgrim&#x27; in the bookmark.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Big and small ultimately depend on the perception of existence, so the existence that can freely control that cognitive realm is the greatest.」</div>「Big and small ultimately depend on the perception of existence, so the existence that can freely control that cognitive realm is the greatest.」</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your understanding of the person in question is considerable!]</div>[Your understanding of the person in question is considerable!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it worth listening to the difficult words so far?</p>

<p class="orv_line">Or, it may be the effect of the strange dumplings I ate then.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The level of the person in question is too high to fully reproduce the skill.]</div>[The level of the person in question is too high to fully reproduce the skill.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja&#x27;s main skill. Baekcheong&#x27;s bright light soon covered my entire body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill, &#x27;Full Personification Lv. 10&#x27;, is activated.]</div>[The exclusive skill, 'Full Personification Lv. 10', is activated.]</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[A powerful skill penalty is eating away at your body!]</div>[A powerful skill penalty is eating away at your body!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I see. [Full Electrification] is a skill that only &quot;dwarves&quot; can use.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your &#x27;status&#x27; overcomes the skill penalty!]</div>[Your 'status' overcomes the skill penalty!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the caster&#x27;s &#x27;Strength&#x27; exceeds a certain level, even non-dwarves can temporarily use [Full Personification].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kugugugugugu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even with destructive power several times its original value.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Kuaaaaak!]</div>[Kuaaaaak!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations that were blocking my path fell away like moths, burning.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[What, what is that!]</div>[What, what is that!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since I had already exhausted my mental power with [Omniscient Reader&#x27;s Viewpoint], the time I could maintain [Full Electrification] was less than 10 seconds. However, I was able to move quite a distance in just those 10 seconds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kuduk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho&#x27;s knees buckled as he could not withstand the power of [Full Electrification]. The [Bookmark] disappeared. I limped on my injured knee and continued to run.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were not swept away by the storm of [Full Electrification]. The constellations began to rush toward me again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I still couldn&#x27;t see the powerhouse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What should I do? Should I use [Incite]? Or should I use [Bookmark] again? If not—</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Come to your senses. You who deceived the stars.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man who said those words was an unexpected person. He supported me and walked about fifteen steps, then blasted the constellations that were rushing toward me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you die, the last of humanity will die too. Do you intend to make my efforts go to waste?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was the Blood Demon who had been resurrected by my [Deceased Summoning].</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Blood Demon&#x27;s corpses that had entered the ark together rushed toward the constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even as his arms flew away and his thighs burst, the Blood Demon did not give up and shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Go. Go and prove that humanity has survived until the end.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then came the sound of the Blood Demon&#x27;s corpses being torn apart. Lightning strikes continued to strike from the angry sky. At that moment, I thought that I could not avoid it this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Evil sophist.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time, someone carried me. At the same time, the falling lightning lost its way and scattered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;My ability here can only last 5 minutes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo, the &#x27;Disappearing One&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His skill of making existence disappear finally shone in the last scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Ten Evils that I had revived just before coming here were there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who was guarding the path I had walked, shouting. Lee Dansu, who was setting up a trap. Kang Ilhun, who was spreading false rumors, saying, &quot;Cheon Inho ran away in the opposite direction!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, a small door appeared at the end of the hallway.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo, whose skill&#x27;s duration had ended, put me down and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It was a good thing I didn&#x27;t disappear this time.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Leaving these words behind, Ye Hyunwoo fought against the constellations with the remaining Ten Evils.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at the backs of the Ten Evils for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Has Cheon Inho seen the same scenery as me? What is the guy who pushed me into this fault thinking as he reads this story?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Soon, the cold handle felt in my hand.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The &#x27;myth-grade constellations&#x27; belonging to the final ark are astonished!]</div>[The 'myth-grade constellations' belonging to the final ark are astonished!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ecstatic smell of stories is felt as soon as the door is opened. The &#x27;power source&#x27; that condensed the most dazzling stories of this world line was glowing yellow in the center of the room. It was the &#x27;story core&#x27; that I had been looking for.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Without hesitation, I reached out to the story core.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have acquired the &#x27;story core&#x27;.]</div>[You have acquired the 'story core'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I destroy this, the last scenario will end.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some &#x27;myth-grade constellations&#x27; try to persuade you!]</div>[Some 'myth-grade constellations' try to persuade you!]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The giant nebula, &lt;Asgard&gt;, wants to offer you a chance to &#x27;board the ark&#x27;!]</div>[The giant nebula, <Asgard>, wants to offer you a chance to 'board the ark'!]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The giant nebula, &lt;Veda&gt;, offers you a piece of &lt;Locapala&gt;!]</div>[The giant nebula, <Veda>, offers you a piece of <Locapala>!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<p class="orv_line">The messages from the myth-grade constellations surged into my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If I was going to stop here, I wouldn&#x27;t have even started.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many &#x27;myth-grade constellations&#x27; say that if you don’t stop right now…!]</div>[Many 'myth-grade constellations' say that if you don’t stop right now…!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I struck the story core with all my might. Perhaps because it was a condensed story, the core didn’t break easily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I struck it, and struck it again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story core began to crack little by little.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, &#x27;Lightning Seat&#x27;, spews out his terrifying rage at you!]</div>[The constellation, 'Lightning Seat', spews out his terrifying rage at you!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Zeus&#x27;s lightning bolt belatedly pierced through the engine room and exploded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I laughed even as I felt the pain of my body burning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s too late, you son of a bitch.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I struck the core for the last time, there was a sound of something breaking. The enormous story that the constellations had gathered to cross world lines was released, and a pillar of light rose toward the sky.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Someone has achieved the clear condition of the &#x27;Last Scenario&#x27;!]</div>[Someone has achieved the clear condition of the 'Last Scenario'!]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The &lt;Star Stream&gt;&#x27;s probability changes drastically!]</div>[The <Star Stream>'s probability changes drastically!]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The entrance to the sealed wall opens!]</div>[The entrance to the sealed wall opens!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I blinked again, I was in a completely different place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A huge wall of text surrounded my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized where I was.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「He couldn&#x27;t tell if it was his thoughts or a record written on the wall. However, what was certain was that everything he thought, said, and did was written on the wall in front of him.」</div>「He couldn't tell if it was his thoughts or a record written on the wall. However, what was certain was that everything he thought, said, and did was written on the wall in front of him.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had finally arrived.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The &#x27;Final Wall&#x27; was there.」</div>「The 'Final Wall' was there.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly placed my hand on the wall and the [Fourth Wall] reacted.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill, &#x27;Fourth Wall&#x27;, activates!]</div>[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall', activates!]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The &#x27;Final Wall&#x27; accepts your presence.]</div>[The 'Final Wall' accepts your presence.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">My body seemed to be seeping in like a fluid, and before I knew it, I was inside the wall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked around, steadying my staggering body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A room made up of dazzlingly glowing hologram monitors. It was a room I knew, a room I had experienced well.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The &#x27;Dokkaebi King&#x27; was there.」</div>「The 'Dokkaebi King' was there.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was dozens of times the size of an average dokkaebi. No matter how I looked at it, it looked extremely obese.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder what it had been eating right before I came in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy who had been chewing something in his mouth turned his huge head and looked at me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Huh? What is it.]</div>[Huh? What is it.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The eyes of the one who had watched the &#x27;scenarios&#x27; the longest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was momentarily overwhelmed by that gaze and lost my words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Dokkaebi King slowly got up from his seat and stood in front of me with his belly rippling, then lowered his head and began to observe me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[How did you get here? This is not a place you are allowed to be?]</div>[How did you get here? This is not a place you are allowed to be?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Dokkaebi King&#x27;s large fingers touched my head. Even though my body would explode if I were crushed, I couldn&#x27;t move a finger.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A spark lightly shot up and an interested expression appeared on the Dokkaebi King&#x27;s face.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Look at this. This isn&#x27;t a normal worldline.]</div>[Look at this. This isn't a normal worldline.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">With just one finger, the Dokkaebi King seemed to understand how I existed here.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Using real life to create elaborate fakes. How could you… I see. You.]</div>[Using real life to create elaborate fakes. How could you… I see. You.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a small exclamation, the Dokkaebi King nodded.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are a being who &#x27;can&#x27;t help but do that&#x27;.]</div>[You are a being who 'can't help but do that'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tried to open my mouth somehow. I tried to ask something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But my lips wouldn&#x27;t open. As if &#x27;this story after this has all been decided&#x27;, my body didn&#x27;t move at all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if he had guessed my state, the Dokkaebi King smiled.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Everything is already written, and is being written at the same time. You came to confirm the &#x27;true ending&#x27; of this world line.]</div>[Everything is already written, and is being written at the same time. You came to confirm the 'true ending' of this world line.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Dokkaebi King smiled kindly and handed me a story fragment.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This is what you were looking for. Small and amazing star.]</div>[This is what you were looking for. Small and amazing star.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the moment I held the story, the stage of the world went dark.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have successfully cleared all the tasks of the &#x27;Time Fault&#x27;!]</div>[You have successfully cleared all the tasks of the 'Time Fault'!]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[All the &#x27;Recorders of Fear&#x27; sigh at your amazing interpretation.]</div>[All the 'Recorders of Fear' sigh at your amazing interpretation.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">The old ending of the 40th round began to be written on the &#x27;Final Wall&#x27;.</p>
