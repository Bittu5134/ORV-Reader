            <div class="orv_title"><h1>764 Episode 33 Ball (3)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Immediately after the twentieth scenario product was released, the hall was filled with excitement for a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But do the other constellations know who the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39; is?</p>
[I heard the story. He is the one who fought against Ares, who had half his powers.]</p></div>
[So you are allowing me to eat his entire tale?]</p></div>
[If it is possible to prey on an Ares-level constellation, it would be possible for a great-grade to become a narrative-grade in an instant.]</p></div>
[But wasn’t there a guy called the Demon King of Salvation here too?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I quietly hid behind the pillar next to the table. There was something unusual going on in the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I already knew that information about the &#39;Kim Dokja fragments&#39; had spread outside. However, it seemed like the information was slowly starting to spread within the Recycling Center as well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You probably already know this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung’s &#39;dokkaebi communication&#39; was heard in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You know that’s a great product, right?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The term &#39;product&#39; bothered me, but I nodded with effort.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;I know. Because it&#39;s my sponsor.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Kim Dokja sleeping in the fish tank really looked like the Kim Dokja I remembered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, I know that Kim Dokja is not that Kim Dokja. It&#39;s just the embodiment of his story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, as I looked at him, a corner of my heart throbbed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It&#39;s not just your sponsor. Have you never heard of &#39;Fragments of the Oldest Dream&#39;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course it was information I knew, but I deliberately did not reply. Because I wanted to hear what Bihyung would say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The Oldest Dream. It is a star that is designated as the first &#39;cause&#39; of all these worlds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first cause of all these worlds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did the middle and lower level dokkaebis even know this information?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#39;t remember very well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it&#39;s a feature unique to the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—There is a story that fragments of that constellation have recently been discovered throughout the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;My sponsor is one of them.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It&#39;s a very big &#39;one&#39;. This information is still known only to large nebulae or high-ranking constellations. This is what the &#39;Recycling Center&#39; revealed this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, when I heard this, I didn&#39;t really understand it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though it is only the 20th scenario, they are offering the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39; as a scenario product?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Let&#39;s say the management bureau can do that. But does it make sense for the &#39;Gourmet Association&#39; to participate in it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If there was such a coveted story, they would be the first to taste it, right?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Anyway, be careful with this scenario. Even if you are the &#39;incarnation of the Oldest Dream&#39;, it won’t be easy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;The incarnation of the Oldest Dream?&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Some constellations call you that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that case, there was something completely wrong with the name. This is because I am the incarnation of the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;, not the incarnation of the &#39;Oldest Dream&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnation of the &#39;Oldest Dream&#39; refers to the guy who is now walking from the other side with wide open eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yoo Jonghyuk.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk from 41st round. The side effects of the &#39;Story Imprint&#39; seem to have been alleviated considerably, and his height, which was previously that of a boy, has now returned to that of a young man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Behind Yoo Jonghyuk stood the group, that had disappeared into the incarnation waiting room. .</p>
<p class="orv_line">I lightly raised my hand towards them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Have you all seen the new scenario that came out?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. What about you, Dokja-ssi? How did the constellations react?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Everyone was shocked, well.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey, there’s nothing special about the constellations.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who rushed over, was the first to murmur. After that, Dansu ahjussi and Cha Yerin were also seen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ji Eunyu-ssi was saved by Meihouwang   &quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all,it was Meihouwang . It seemed like he had safely escaped from the hunting dogs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;My brother went somewhere alone for a while.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He probably went there to prepare for the next scenario. Killer King may seem absurd on the outside, but he is thorough when it comes to scenarios.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But my companions seemed to have something else they wanted to say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked into their eyes closely and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who else was in the waiting room?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There were a lot. I also saw Anna Croft and Asuka Ren.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft and Asuka Ren.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Were they also active at the &#39;Recycling Center&#39;? I don&#39;t know which faction they chose, but if we become enemies with them, things won&#39;t be easy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But they both got off.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#39;t believe my ears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Those two quit the scenario?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. This time, with the difficulty level being raised, it became possible to escape the scenario. They escaped right then.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if Asuka Ren is like that, what about Anna Croft? There is no way the Prophet could have run away even after checking the product details?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And Anna told me to give you this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cha Yerin said that and handed over a crumpled paper:</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I give in this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I read the neatly written handwriting, I smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A prophet would have already figured out how things are going here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was at that time that Dansu ahjussi, who had been listening and observing the conversation, opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;By the way, friend. Can I ask you one thing?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. Just ask.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That face…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It did. I was wondering when you would ask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at my face reflected in the glass on the table.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how you look at it, it&#39;s the same face as Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It may have seemed strange to the party members who were familiar with Cheon Inho&#39;s face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi, who had been pausing, asked with a heavy expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why have you suddenly become so handsome?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked blankly at Dansu ahjussi. Then Kyung Sein intervened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey, ahjussi! That’s not the question!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes? Then…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You don’t know whose face that face is?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Whose face is it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s Kim Dokja, Kim Dokja!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that I think about it, Dansu ahjussi has only read the entire novel once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the favorite of Jiyoon, the daughter of Dansu ahjussi, was Yoo Jonghyuk. It wasn&#39;t strange that he didn&#39;t know Kim Dokja&#39;s face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then it’s even weirder. If that’s really Kim Dokja’s face—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ahjussi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein grabbed Dansu ahjussi’s wrist. It was as if she was telling him not to say any more.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, the sense of discomfort I felt from my companions earlier was not an illusion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Their eyes look strangely anxious every time they look at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at my companions with calm eyes and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What happened in the waiting room?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, Kyung Sein, who had hesitated, opened her mouth first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Actually, I met Ye Hyunwoo in the waiting room.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And Goo Seonah. Do you remember Goo Seonah? She used to use iron guns in Chungmuro—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I remember.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Seonah, the Cheolgon woman.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The last time I saw her was at Gwanghwamun Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that time, I, who had just started reading 『Heir of the Eternal Name』, absorbed the soul of Kim Kyungsik, who became a &#39;Kim Dokja fragment&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah, who happened to witness the scene, was greatly shocked and left Gwanghwamun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was worried because she hadn&#39;t been seen since, but it appears she was also a participant in this scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Seonah said something a little strange.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein took a deep breath and looked straight into my eyes and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don’t trust Dokja-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought I knew why Goo Seonah said that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because she clearly saw me absorbing Kim Kyungsik.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know if Goo Seonah told my group in detail or not, but if that causes my group to stop trusting me...</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There’s no need to look so serious.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned my head, Dansu ahjussi was speaking with stern eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If we don’t trust you, who will we trust?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think so too. I was just worried that Goo Seonah said something strange, so I was wondering whether I should tell it or not. Dokja-ssi might be offended.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I once again felt sorry for my companions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If they found out that I was becoming stronger by absorbing the &#39;Kim Dokja fragments&#39;, if they found out that I absorbed Kim Kyungsik’s soul… Will my companions treat me like they do now even then?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But when I see your face, I feel like I have to tell you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;My face?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, because those two—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard the next words, I felt my heart lightly sink.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s a little, but... Goo Seonah and Ye Hyunwoo also had similar faces to the current Dokja-ssi.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah and Ye Hyunwoo,</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to meet them and talk to them if possible, but it seemed like they wouldn&#39;t come to the hall.</p>
[Story &#39;Heir of the Eternal Name&#39; chuckles.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Two people turned into faces similar to mine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#39;t entirely unexpected. In the end, the more &#39;Kim Dokja fragments&#39; we collect, the more similar we become to &#39;Kim Dokja&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fact that their facial features have changed must be proof that they have also collected a certain number of &#39;fragments of Kim Dokja&#39;.</p>
[Start entering the scenario.]</p></div>
[If you agree to enter, please enter through the door in the center of the hall.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Before we knew it, it was time to enter the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked back at my companions and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m asking just in case you don’t know…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cha Yerin answered as if she already knew my question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You will tell us not to participate.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think so.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Twentieth&#39; main scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This scenario was of the same level of difficulty as the 73rd Demon World. Monsters equivalent to demon nobles will appear, and boss-level monsters equivalent to demon dukes or constellations will appear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is that it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">We must fight against the other constellations of the zodiac. This means that confrontations with at least great-grade constellations are inevitably scheduled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We’ve fought with the constellations before.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The probability tolerance is different from the eighth scenario.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Most of the constellations we faced were guys who had squandered their reputation. Even those who appeared awkwardly, bound by the probability constraints of lower-level scenarios.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the &#39;20th&#39; scenario is a different story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then Cha Ye-mrin asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What do you think Kim Dokja would have done?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">What would Kim Dokja have done?</p>
<p class="orv_line">None of us knew the answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein laughed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Have you forgotten? We are also &#39;Kim Dokja&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi nodded and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We also have an &#39;Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sighed lightly and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You know that survival is the top priority, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">My companions nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk, who had been listening to the story as if he was not interested, walked past us first, and Killer King appeared from nowhere and followed him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;</p>
[Entering a new scenario area!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A bright beam of light enveloped our entire bodies and the landscape began to change.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although I spoke calmly, I was actually very worried about this scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in the &#39;Ways of Survival&#39;, the &#39;Recycling Center&#39; scenario has never unfolded like it does now. The stage for this scenario was a place that even I didn&#39;t really know about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;...Thus, the Demon King of the beginning arose from the conflict between good and evil...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A voice that occasionally reaches my ears. It was a calm and intelligent voice. A powerful tone that feels like something I&#39;ve heard before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;...So, the cause of the Holy Demon War...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I slowly opened my eyes, the first thing I saw was the neat letters written on the blackboard.</p>
「History of the Demon World.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at the blackboard for a long time, wondering if I was looking at something in vain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But nothing changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Across the blackboard, I could see the backs of the students&#39; heads sitting on chairs and taking class.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s definitely true. This was a school.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, why am I at school?</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I unconsciously turned my head, I saw my reflection in the window. A name tag was attached to the chest of the refreshing beige school uniform.</p>
[Kim Dokja.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Goosebumps slowly appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hmm, what’s outside the window?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The teacher was looking at me. As I slowly stood up, I could see the teacher&#39;s face more clearly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then I realized why I thought his voice sounded familiar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Would you like to talk about the &#39;Devil’s Justice&#39; that I just explained?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely true.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is the &#39;Reclining Dragon&#39; who came to the &#39;Recycling Center&#39; as an evaluator.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Zhuge Gongming.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Student Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took a deep breath and started talking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The Demon King refers to the corrupted constellations that abandoned their own scenarios and polluted the scenario region to establish their own realm.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was talking without even knowing what I was talking about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How much was that noise?</p>
[You have satisfied the unique settings for that person.]</p></div>
[The world view gives you 500 coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Satisfied the unique settings? What does it mean?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Teacher Waryong shook his head as if impressed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s pretty good. Well, even in inferior classes, not all are at the same level. Now, that’s it for today’s class. Everyone, prepare well for the graduation exam—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ding-dong music rang out, and the children who were lying face down on their desks stood up all at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Meanwhile, there were children coming towards me. These were all faces I had never seen before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow, how do you memorize it all? Even though I heard it, I don’t understand a thing.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hee, it feels like a hit.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You idiot, this isn’t power, it’s hiding knowledge.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at them quietly and cautiousl y opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who are you—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsk tsk tsk tsk!</p>
[You made a statement that is not appropriate for the person in question!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I almost screamed at the lightly bouncing sparks.</p>
[Warning. The &#39;Memory Loss&#39; setting does not exist for you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#39;t until I received one message after another that I began to understand little by little what the situation was.</p>
[A new scenario has arrived.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Main Scenario #20 – Graduation&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Main</p>
<p>Difficulty: ???</p>
<p>Clear Condition: You have joined the old story according to the contract with the &#39;Recycling Center&#39;. Solve the scenario by finding the clear conditions for that world view.</p>
<p>Time limit: 15 days</p>
<p>Reward: Fragment of the Oldest Dream, ???</p>
<p>Failure: —</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">While reading the scenario, I thought of Euphrosyne&#39;s voice.</p>
「Reenactment of an old story.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, this stage seemed to be a system that imitated the Island of the Reincarnated — the &#39;Kaizenix Island&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is that the genre is a little different from back then.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Kim Dokja, 3rd grade, 2nd class. Kim Dokja, 3rd grade, 2nd class, go to the teacher’s office immediately…</p>
<p class="orv_line">I jumped up from my seat and headed into the hallway. As I walked down the hallway, I carefully observed the passing scenery.</p>
<p class="orv_line">First of all, this stage did not have a particularly unusual worldview. Judging from the fact that the terms constellation, demon king, and scenario are also used the same way, it seems to share a worldview with the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just look at my name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging by the fact that my name was still &#39;Kim Dokja&#39;, this worldview seemed closer to a kind of &#39;arranged worldview&#39; rather than possession.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, I am called &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; just like on the outside, but my settings have been changed to fit this worldview.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the students&#39; reactions, it seems like I am a kind of brainy character.</p>
[Explore the clear conditions for the scenario.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As with the Gourmet Association&#39;s 『Bracelets Expedition』, this scenario is probably not the beginning of the world view.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In short, it may be the time before an important event like &#39;Kaizenix.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Third year graduation exam.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quietly looked at the promotional flyer posted on the bulletin board.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, it’s Kim Dokja, our sunbae .&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Students passing by me bowed their heads and said hello. “Sunbae ”, I can’t remember the last time I heard that word.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were people waiting for me in front of the teacher’s office.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Dokja-ssi! You’re here! Ugegege!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sein-ssi, if you say something like that here, there will be repercussions—gegegegege!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know how many genres there are in this world, but at least one thing seems certain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Dokja, if this continues, our class will not be able to take the graduation exam.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We became students of the &#39;Academy&#39;.</p>
