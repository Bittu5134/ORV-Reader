<p class="orv_line">Immediately after the twentieth scenario product was released, the hall was filled with excitement for a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But do the other constellations know who the 'Demon King of Salvation' is?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I heard the story. He is the one who fought against Ares, who had half his powers.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[So you are allowing me to eat his entire tale?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[If it is possible to prey on an Ares-level constellation, it would be possible for a great-grade to become a narrative-grade in an instant.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[But wasn’t there a guy called the Demon King of Salvation here too?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I quietly hid behind the pillar next to the table. There was something unusual going on in the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I already knew that information about the 'Kim Dokja fragments' had spread outside. However, it seemed like the information was slowly starting to spread within the Recycling Center as well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You probably already know this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung’s 'dokkaebi communication' was heard in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You know that’s a great product, right?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The term 'product' bothered me, but I nodded with effort.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I know. Because it's my sponsor.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Kim Dokja sleeping in the fish tank really looked like the Kim Dokja I remembered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, I know that Kim Dokja is not that Kim Dokja. It's just the embodiment of his story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, as I looked at him, a corner of my heart throbbed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It's not just your sponsor. Have you never heard of 'Fragments of the Oldest Dream'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course it was information I knew, but I deliberately did not reply. Because I wanted to hear what Bihyung would say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The Oldest Dream. It is a star that is designated as the first 'cause' of all these worlds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first cause of all these worlds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did the middle and lower level dokkaebis even know this information?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't remember very well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it's a feature unique to the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—There is a story that fragments of that constellation have recently been discovered throughout the <Star Stream>.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'My sponsor is one of them.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It's a very big 'one'. This information is still known only to large nebulae or high-ranking constellations. This is what the 'Recycling Center' revealed this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, when I heard this, I didn't really understand it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though it is only the 20th scenario, they are offering the 'Demon King of Salvation' as a scenario product?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Let's say the management bureau can do that. But does it make sense for the 'Gourmet Association' to participate in it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If there was such a coveted story, they would be the first to taste it, right?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Anyway, be careful with this scenario. Even if you are the 'incarnation of the Oldest Dream', it won’t be easy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'The incarnation of the Oldest Dream?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Some constellations call you that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that case, there was something completely wrong with the name. This is because I am the incarnation of the 'Demon King of Salvation', not the incarnation of the 'Oldest Dream'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnation of the 'Oldest Dream' refers to the guy who is now walking from the other side with wide open eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Jonghyuk."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk from 41st round. The side effects of the 'Story Imprint' seem to have been alleviated considerably, and his height, which was previously that of a boy, has now returned to that of a young man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Behind Yoo Jonghyuk stood the group, that had disappeared into the incarnation waiting room. .</p>
<p class="orv_line">I lightly raised my hand towards them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Have you all seen the new scenario that came out?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. What about you, Dokja-ssi? How did the constellations react?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Everyone was shocked, well."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey, there’s nothing special about the constellations."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who rushed over, was the first to murmur. After that, Dansu ahjussi and Cha Yerin were also seen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ji Eunyu-ssi was saved by Meihouwang   "</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all,it was Meihouwang . It seemed like he had safely escaped from the hunting dogs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"My brother went somewhere alone for a while."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He probably went there to prepare for the next scenario. Killer King may seem absurd on the outside, but he is thorough when it comes to scenarios.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But my companions seemed to have something else they wanted to say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked into their eyes closely and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who else was in the waiting room?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There were a lot. I also saw Anna Croft and Asuka Ren."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft and Asuka Ren.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Were they also active at the 'Recycling Center'? I don't know which faction they chose, but if we become enemies with them, things won't be easy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But they both got off."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't believe my ears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Those two quit the scenario?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. This time, with the difficulty level being raised, it became possible to escape the scenario. They escaped right then."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if Asuka Ren is like that, what about Anna Croft? There is no way the Prophet could have run away even after checking the product details?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"And Anna told me to give you this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cha Yerin said that and handed over a crumpled paper:</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I give in this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I read the neatly written handwriting, I smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A prophet would have already figured out how things are going here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was at that time that Dansu ahjussi, who had been listening and observing the conversation, opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"By the way, friend. Can I ask you one thing?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. Just ask."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That face…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It did. I was wondering when you would ask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at my face reflected in the glass on the table.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how you look at it, it's the same face as Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It may have seemed strange to the party members who were familiar with Cheon Inho's face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi, who had been pausing, asked with a heavy expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why have you suddenly become so handsome?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked blankly at Dansu ahjussi. Then Kyung Sein intervened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey, ahjussi! That’s not the question!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes? Then…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You don’t know whose face that face is?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Whose face is it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s Kim Dokja, Kim Dokja!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that I think about it, Dansu ahjussi has only read the entire novel once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the favorite of Jiyoon, the daughter of Dansu ahjussi, was Yoo Jonghyuk. It wasn't strange that he didn't know Kim Dokja's face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then it’s even weirder. If that’s really Kim Dokja’s face—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein grabbed Dansu ahjussi’s wrist. It was as if she was telling him not to say any more.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, the sense of discomfort I felt from my companions earlier was not an illusion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Their eyes look strangely anxious every time they look at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at my companions with calm eyes and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What happened in the waiting room?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, Kyung Sein, who had hesitated, opened her mouth first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Actually, I met Ye Hyunwoo in the waiting room."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"And Goo Seonah. Do you remember Goo Seonah? She used to use iron guns in Chungmuro—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I remember."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Seonah, the Cheolgon woman.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The last time I saw her was at Gwanghwamun Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that time, I, who had just started reading 『Heir of the Eternal Name』, absorbed the soul of Kim Kyungsik, who became a 'Kim Dokja fragment'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah, who happened to witness the scene, was greatly shocked and left Gwanghwamun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was worried because she hadn't been seen since, but it appears she was also a participant in this scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Seonah said something a little strange."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein took a deep breath and looked straight into my eyes and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don’t trust Dokja-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought I knew why Goo Seonah said that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because she clearly saw me absorbing Kim Kyungsik.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know if Goo Seonah told my group in detail or not, but if that causes my group to stop trusting me...</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There’s no need to look so serious."</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned my head, Dansu ahjussi was speaking with stern eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If we don’t trust you, who will we trust?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I think so too. I was just worried that Goo Seonah said something strange, so I was wondering whether I should tell it or not. Dokja-ssi might be offended."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I once again felt sorry for my companions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If they found out that I was becoming stronger by absorbing the 'Kim Dokja fragments', if they found out that I absorbed Kim Kyungsik’s soul… Will my companions treat me like they do now even then?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But when I see your face, I feel like I have to tell you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"My face?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, because those two—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard the next words, I felt my heart lightly sink.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s a little, but... Goo Seonah and Ye Hyunwoo also had similar faces to the current Dokja-ssi."</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah and Ye Hyunwoo,</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to meet them and talk to them if possible, but it seemed like they wouldn't come to the hall.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' chuckles.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Two people turned into faces similar to mine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't entirely unexpected. In the end, the more 'Kim Dokja fragments' we collect, the more similar we become to 'Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fact that their facial features have changed must be proof that they have also collected a certain number of 'fragments of Kim Dokja'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Start entering the scenario.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[If you agree to enter, please enter through the door in the center of the hall.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Before we knew it, it was time to enter the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked back at my companions and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m asking just in case you don’t know…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cha Yerin answered as if she already knew my question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You will tell us not to participate."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I think so."</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Twentieth' main scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This scenario was of the same level of difficulty as the 73rd Demon World. Monsters equivalent to demon nobles will appear, and boss-level monsters equivalent to demon dukes or constellations will appear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is that it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">We must fight against the other constellations of the zodiac. This means that confrontations with at least great-grade constellations are inevitably scheduled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We’ve fought with the constellations before."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The probability tolerance is different from the eighth scenario."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Most of the constellations we faced were guys who had squandered their reputation. Even those who appeared awkwardly, bound by the probability constraints of lower-level scenarios.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the '20th' scenario is a different story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then Cha Ye-mrin asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What do you think Kim Dokja would have done?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">What would Kim Dokja have done?</p>
<p class="orv_line">None of us knew the answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein laughed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Have you forgotten? We are also 'Kim Dokja'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi nodded and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We also have an 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sighed lightly and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You know that survival is the top priority, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">My companions nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk, who had been listening to the story as if he was not interested, walked past us first, and Killer King appeared from nowhere and followed him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's go."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Entering a new scenario area!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A bright beam of light enveloped our entire bodies and the landscape began to change.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although I spoke calmly, I was actually very worried about this scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in the 'Ways of Survival', the 'Recycling Center' scenario has never unfolded like it does now. The stage for this scenario was a place that even I didn't really know about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"...Thus, the Demon King of the beginning arose from the conflict between good and evil..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A voice that occasionally reaches my ears. It was a calm and intelligent voice. A powerful tone that feels like something I've heard before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"...So, the cause of the Holy Demon War..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I slowly opened my eyes, the first thing I saw was the neat letters written on the blackboard.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「History of the Demon World.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at the blackboard for a long time, wondering if I was looking at something in vain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But nothing changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Across the blackboard, I could see the backs of the students' heads sitting on chairs and taking class.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's definitely true. This was a school.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, why am I at school?</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I unconsciously turned my head, I saw my reflection in the window. A name tag was attached to the chest of the refreshing beige school uniform.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Kim Dokja.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Goosebumps slowly appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hmm, what’s outside the window?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The teacher was looking at me. As I slowly stood up, I could see the teacher's face more clearly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then I realized why I thought his voice sounded familiar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Would you like to talk about the 'Devil’s Justice' that I just explained?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely true.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is the 'Reclining Dragon' who came to the 'Recycling Center' as an evaluator.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Zhuge Gongming.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Student Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took a deep breath and started talking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The Demon King refers to the corrupted constellations that abandoned their own scenarios and polluted the scenario region to establish their own realm."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was talking without even knowing what I was talking about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How much was that noise?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have satisfied the unique settings for that person.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The world view gives you 500 coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Satisfied the unique settings? What does it mean?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Teacher Waryong shook his head as if impressed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s pretty good. Well, even in inferior classes, not all are at the same level. Now, that’s it for today’s class. Everyone, prepare well for the graduation exam—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ding-dong music rang out, and the children who were lying face down on their desks stood up all at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Meanwhile, there were children coming towards me. These were all faces I had never seen before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wow, how do you memorize it all? Even though I heard it, I don’t understand a thing."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hee, it feels like a hit."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You idiot, this isn’t power, it’s hiding knowledge."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at them quietly and cautiousl y opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who are you—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsk tsk tsk tsk!</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You made a statement that is not appropriate for the person in question!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I almost screamed at the lightly bouncing sparks.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Warning. The 'Memory Loss' setting does not exist for you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't until I received one message after another that I began to understand little by little what the situation was.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new scenario has arrived.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p><Main Scenario #20 – Graduation></p>
<p>Category: Main</p>
<p>Difficulty: ???</p>
<p>Clear Condition: You have joined the old story according to the contract with the 'Recycling Center'. Solve the scenario by finding the clear conditions for that world view.</p>
<p>Time limit: 15 days</p>
<p>Reward: Fragment of the Oldest Dream, ???</p>
<p>Failure: —</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">While reading the scenario, I thought of Euphrosyne's voice.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Reenactment of an old story.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, this stage seemed to be a system that imitated the Island of the Reincarnated — the 'Kaizenix Island'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is that the genre is a little different from back then.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Kim Dokja, 3rd grade, 2nd class. Kim Dokja, 3rd grade, 2nd class, go to the teacher’s office immediately…</p>
<p class="orv_line">I jumped up from my seat and headed into the hallway. As I walked down the hallway, I carefully observed the passing scenery.</p>
<p class="orv_line">First of all, this stage did not have a particularly unusual worldview. Judging from the fact that the terms constellation, demon king, and scenario are also used the same way, it seems to share a worldview with the <Star Stream>.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just look at my name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging by the fact that my name was still 'Kim Dokja', this worldview seemed closer to a kind of 'arranged worldview' rather than possession.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, I am called 'Kim Dokja' just like on the outside, but my settings have been changed to fit this worldview.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the students' reactions, it seems like I am a kind of brainy character.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Explore the clear conditions for the scenario.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As with the Gourmet Association's 『Bracelets Expedition』, this scenario is probably not the beginning of the world view.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In short, it may be the time before an important event like 'Kaizenix.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Third year graduation exam.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quietly looked at the promotional flyer posted on the bulletin board.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, it’s Kim Dokja, our sunbae ."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Students passing by me bowed their heads and said hello. “Sunbae ”, I can’t remember the last time I heard that word.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were people waiting for me in front of the teacher’s office.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Dokja-ssi! You’re here! Ugegege!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sein-ssi, if you say something like that here, there will be repercussions—gegegegege!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know how many genres there are in this world, but at least one thing seems certain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja, if this continues, our class will not be able to take the graduation exam."</p>
<p class="orv_line">We became students of the 'Academy'.</p>
