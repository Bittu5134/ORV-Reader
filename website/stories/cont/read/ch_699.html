            <div class="orv_title"><h1>699 Episode 25 Demon King (2)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">As if he had been waiting for him, the demon noble calmly turned toward the entrance of the Capitol.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Yoo Jonghyuk did not move a single step. His past lives were talking to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's a trap.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it wasn't a trap, he didn't believe anything the Demon King's liaison said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Prophet."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft had no answer to Yoo Jonghyuk's call.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When he glanced over, she saw Anna Croft staggering around, her complexion pale.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don’t know why, but [Future Sight] doesn’t work."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Future Sight doesn’t work. Even in his last round, Anna Croft's skills often broke down.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But it was such an odd timing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk analyzed Anna Croft's condition with calm eyes and made a quick decision.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You’re useless whenever it’s important."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before he knew it, the demon noble was more than twenty steps away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk had already obtained information about this guy through [Sage's Eyes].</p>
<p class="orv_line">'It's Viscount Nikhteri the Devil.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">This guy was a 'self-made devil'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Based on the original scenario difficulty, this guy should only appear in the eighth scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That guy said, 'The Demon King of Salvation is waiting'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Inside the Capitol, there is a real agent of the 'Demon King'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Probably, the probability that there is an incarnation capable of being possessed by the Demon King is higher than the possibility that there is a symbolic body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that case, he must be considered to be at least an earl-level Demon King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk took a deep breath. With each breath, the magical power condensed in his entire body continued to rotate.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In general, 'Iljucheon' refers to the circulation of the magic power contained in the Danjeon to all microscopic blood vessels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, with his master, 'Iljucheon' was used with a different meaning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only when the circulating magic draws a complete circle does the body become an eye in itself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Eyes that perceive the world through expanded five senses.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Through those eyes, humans see the sky. You realize that the sky, which seemed beautiful and wide, was actually a prison in a terrible scenario.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"In fact, it is to recognize that this whole world is just a joke in the sky. That is Iljucheon, the entrance to Pacheon."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At this point, it was still difficult to count the stars in the sky. However, it was not difficult to count the demon species on earth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A total of four?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shocked, Viscount Nihterida looked back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Next, three stone statues radiated a gloomy light from above the stone building of the Capitol.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The evil Viscount 'Bricolakas' is hostile towards you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The evil Viscount 'Scupedia' is showing hostility towards you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The evil Viscount 'Myrmicoleon' shows his hostility towards you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As many as four demon viscounts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In no round did he face four self-made demons at the same time in the seventh scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Coo coo coo coo coo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft bit her lip as she felt the pressure of the demonic species pressing down on the area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"They are the demons who killed my comrades."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps these demons were summoned in the fifth scenario. Starting from only the fifth scenario, it was obvious that no country could handle this level of difficulty.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Yoo Jonghyuk's eyes gave off a sharp light, the viscounts looked at each other as if they were curious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Coo coo coo coo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it had been the previous round, or if it had been the round even before, Yoo Jonghyuk would never have confronted them. Fighting with four viscount-level fighters in the seventh scenario is tantamount to suicide.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Yoo Jonghyuk did not back down. Because this round was neither the 39th nor the 40th.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This world is the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Yoo Jonghyuk's body disappeared, the three Viscounts simultaneously drew their weapons towards Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Brycolakas held the long incense stick that was his main weapon, Scoupedia held the dual-wielding daggers, and Myrmicleon held the swollen drumstick.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Magical energy containing deep evil karma burst out in a semicircle around the three demons.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment , Yoo Jonghyuk's agility had reached the limit of the scenario. However, in the eyes of the demonic viscounts, it was a speed that wasn’t desirable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The viscounts' eyes were simultaneously nailed to a single point in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is it there?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The spear, dual-wielding daggers, and the drumstick struck a point in the air at the same time. The demonic viscounts laughed along with a cruel explosion sound. They thought Yoo Jonghyuk would have been crushed mercilessly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, when the black ether that dyed the air black disappeared, Yoo Jonghyuk was not there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">That couldn't have been possible. There was no way just one incarnation could avoid the eyes of a demon noble who had evolved.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment when the demon Viscount Myrmicoleon sensed something was wrong, he opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Skag.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a sound as if the world was splitting in two, the head of Demon Viscount Myrmicoleon was blown off.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For the first time, agitation spread across the demons' faces.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Let's say he’s just out of their sight. However, a viscount-level demon was killed in one blow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It does not make sense—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">But to the current Yoo Jonghyuk, it 'made sense'. The power he now manifests was obtained at a high price.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Restraint of Truth' is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">One of his three story imprints, 'The Redemption of Truth'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some of your memories are sealed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'Story Engraving' that unleashes power in exchange for some of the memories from the previous round being sealed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[All your overall abilities will temporarily exceed the scenario limit!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Explosive power surges from your entire body!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In Yoo Jonghyuk's mind, a memory he cherished was fading away. It was a memory he dedicated.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Captain. This is a birthday present. It's my favorite toshi..."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung in the 22nd round, smiling with a simple face. The old toshi he handed him was disappearing from his mind. The temperature of his heart decreased and his heart became infinitely cold.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps Yoo Jonghyuk will never remember that smile again. Instead, Yoo Jonghyuk will remember something else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His long journey of regression has finally come to an end, a memory that will not disappear until the end of his life.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Captain. Will you please take revenge in the next round?"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I will grant your wish, Lee Hyunsung."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He will remember only sorrow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I will fight against the sky of this world using the hatred born of that sadness as my driving force.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You! How dare you!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The demonic Viscount Scoupedia charged at him, brandishing his dual daggers. The pitch-black river that formed at the end of his weapons streaked Yoo Joonghyuk's cheek.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But even faster than that, Yoo Joonghyuk had already pierced Scoupedia's heart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Deep.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Scoupedia, who vomited black blood, died. Vrycolakas and Nihterida, enraged, joined forces and rushed forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was an attack prepared to defeat Donggui.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Ammu created by Nihterida covered the field of vision, and Vrykolakas' long spear split into a dozen pieces and flew in from all directions. Several polearms grazed Yoo Jonghyuk's thighs and waist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Skag.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Vricolakas' head fell.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now all that remained was the demonic Viscount Nihterida.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nihterida, who hesitated and retreated, said,</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you doing? Why are you opposing us? The Demon King has no hostility towards you!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nihterida, who had even thrown away his pride as a demon species, shouted in a panic.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hmm, why would you do something like this? The 'Demon King of Salvation' will definitely be fine if you call him."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nihterida, realizing that the situation was unfavorable, looked at him then quickly turned back and began to run away.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Suzaku Shinbo Lv.10' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk's thigh muscles wriggled like an animal once again. His footsteps pushed into the ground deeply with a loud noise. Yoo Jonghyuk concentrated his magic power by spinning it around in the air. [Pacheon Ganggi], which extended toward the sky with its centrifugal force.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Flashlight Lv.8' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The magic power gathered turned into holy light and created a large hole in Nihterida's upper body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Redemption of Truth' ends.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as his magic power was exhausted, Yoo Jonghyuk took out the 'Advanced Magic Power Recovery Potion' from his arms and drank it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The liquid that fell seeped into his entire body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk lightly wiped his mouth with a somewhat tired expression then immediately looked at the equipment items dropped by the demon species.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Ancient demon's necklace.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Half armor of great strength.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Ammu Belt.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">All three were not bad pieces of equipment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'half armor of great strength', which increased strength, was suitable for Lee Hyunsung, whose main focus is hand-to-hand combat, and the 'ammu belt' was suitable for Yoo Jonghyuk himself to wear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I guess I can give this to him.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Ancient Demon's Necklace', which increases stun resistance, was for the guy who fainted frequently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's useless in its current state, so filling it in would be of some help.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna asked in bewilderment as she saw Yoo Jonghyuk standing up after finishing maintenance in an instant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What on earth did you do?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There is no part for you. You didn’t help in the battle."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That’s not what I’m talking about."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, Yoo Jonghyuk knew what had surprised Anna Croft.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was incredible. The level of prowess he had just shown was incomparable to any incarnation of the same scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you really make a 'story imprint'? Have you forgotten what the villains who used it said?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk also knew the fate of those 'villains'. Some of them had their existence sealed because they could not find a way to get rid of it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s about borrowing and writing a fictional 'story'. Its power will eat away at your soul and memories."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s none of your business."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What have you lost in return?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk did not answer, but Anna Croft knew what he had lost.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Prophet. There is a necessary memory. Use [Future Sight]."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">To a regressor, 'memory' is everything to existence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why did you do that... Sealed memories don’t come back! Now you’ve lost them forever. Do you even know what that means?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The disappeared worlds exist only through his memories, and he also maintains his identity by not forgetting those memories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk gave his memories in return.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You will end up becoming someone else. You will not even know who you are."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You talk like you know who you are."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if any further conversation was meaningless, Yoo Jonghyuk began to walk away again. There were traces of the demons' blood in each of his footprints.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft stared blankly at the footprints he left behind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he fails, what meaning will these footprints have?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If there ever comes a moment when even she gives up reading her past with [Future Sight], then who will remember that long record of failures of that regressor?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Should she make it difficult?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait a minute. Wait, King!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, who belatedly woke up from her thoughts, quickly followed Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, before he could walk even a short distance, Yoo Jonghyuk suddenly stopped walking. She didn't need to ask what was going on. This is because he saw someone walking out from inside the Capitol.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A formidable magical energy that made his whole body tremble.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Run, Prophet."</p>
<p class="orv_line">For the first time, Yoo Jonghyuk's expression hardened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s a 'Marquis' level demon."</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">That's where Anna Croft's story ended.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait a minute. So what happened?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wasn't some important information missing?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What happened to Yoo Jonghyuk, who fought a marquis-level demon?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If something like that happens, how can you be sure that your companions will be safe?</p>
<p class="orv_line">So who is the 'Demon King of Salvation' over there?</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, I couldn't bear it anymore and insisted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Could it be that you threw Yoo Jonghyuk there and ran away alone?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Before we continue, there’s something I need to ask you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I already knew what Anna Croft would 'ask'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the first place, she started this story to earn time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations surrounding the outside of the living room from earlier were proof of this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, no matter how many incarnations surrounded this place, it wasn't a big threat to me. That is, as long as the combat power of the incarnations is within the realm of probability.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We have 'tactical nuclear weapons'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"So?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tactical nuclear weapon. It seemed like they had managed to secure modern weapons from the generation before the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You’re not planning on flying that thing at the Washington Dome, are you? You know there’s no point in doing something like that."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A nuclear weapon with that level of destructive power cannot be activated due to the scenario structure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps the moment the launch button is pressed against the Washington Dome, the nuclear weapon will stop operating due to the probability aftereffects.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But now, instead of launching a tactical nuclear weapon at the Washington Dome, she brought that weapon to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I heard from Christina that you are a 'family member' of the Demon King."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps Anna Croft had made up her mind. If necessary, she will use that 'nuclear weapon' here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is the name of the Demon King you serve 'Demon King of Salvation'?"</p>
