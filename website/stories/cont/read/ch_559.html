            <div class="orv_title"><h1>559 Episode 2. Rewrite (4)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">I stared down at the bug&#39;s body for a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It didn&#39;t make sense. Something must be wrong with the &lt;Star Stream&gt; system if it still deemed</p>
<p class="orv_line">this bug to be &#39;alive&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Now I just have to wait, right? I did as I was told.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey, we&#39;ve completed our assignment, let us out!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why isn&#39;t there a scenario completion message. A system message should have appeared as soon</p>
<p class="orv_line">as the bug was killed.</p>
[There has been a problem with the main scenario system.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With a tsuchuchut sound, Bihyung appeared out of thin air. He looked back at me and the others</p>
<p class="orv_line">with a troubled look on its face.</p>
[Hey...... everyone.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I saw his face, I realized what I missed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was an idiot. Why didn&#39;t I notice sooner?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Here&#39;s another one who&#39;s playing tricks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A little while ago, Bihyung said that in the dokkaebi communication.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That meant that I wasn&#39;t the only one who was playing the scenario in an unusual way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first, I thought he was referring to Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was something I hadn&#39;t considered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There wasn&#39;t just one &#39;reader&#39; in this scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung, who was twitching his lips, spoke up in a disapproving voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">same thing happen at the same time.......]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The exact same thing happening at the exact same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at the ahjussi. He seemed to be thinking the same thing.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No way.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Somewhere in the world, there are readers who have read &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39; just like him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They knew the solution to the first scenario, just like we did, so they chose to catch bugs and</p>
<p class="orv_line">clear the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What we didn&#39;t realize was that too many people had used that solution.</p>
[The Bureau has detected an unnatural flow in the scenario.]</p></div>
[The probability of the scenario beings to tilt.]</p></div>
[The will of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; is moving.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A trope that has been tried so often, it has lost its novelty.</p>
[You&#39;ve got to hand it to humans for being cruel, killing poor bugs to save their own lives....]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced down at the bug carcasses strewn throughout the station. Miserably squashed and</p>
<p class="orv_line">trampled corpses.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The recognition of bugs as &#39;living things&#39; might mean that they were also &#39;scenario participants&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So what did we look like in their eyes?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung looked at the bug carcasses on the floor, shook his head, and turned away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;W-what&#39;s that all about?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I thought we were supposed to kill bugs to live?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;ll be fine, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s just trying to scare us.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Right, right, we played by the rules!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this world, the rules of the &#39;scenario&#39; were absolute.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In particular, the &#39;Main Scenario&#39; had an authority that even the dokkaebis could not violate.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much Bihyung disliked the situation, the main scenario could not be changed</p>
<p class="orv_line">unless the entire Bureau moved.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsuchuchuchut.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It had to be like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;U-uaaa! What&#39;s going on?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This had never happened in &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not even when the &lt;Kim Dokja&#39;s Company&gt; entered the 1,865th round with Group Regression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I instinctively looked up into the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#39;t see any stars in the ceiling-blocked sky. However, somewhere in that unseen sky, there</p>
<p class="orv_line">must be constellations watching our underground struggle.</p>
[The probability of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; is moving.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered the grand principle of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; that I had forgotten for the past three</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">years.</p>
<p class="orv_line">interested in.」</p>
[The main scenario contents have changed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It felt like the celestial body of the universe was tilting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And at that exact tilt, I could hear the laws of the world twisting.</p>
[For this scenario only, &#39;bugs&#39; are excluded from &#39;living creatures&#39;.]</p></div>
[For the purposes of this scenario, &#39;bug killing&#39; is no longer recognized as &#39;killing a living thing&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">People screamed everywhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the center of the abyss, I saw my own reflection in a window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Through a door&#39;s window, a strange man was smiling at me.</p>
「Now that&#39;s more like &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39;.」</p></div>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I once wrote that a story becomes a different story when you read it again. I still think that&#39;s</p>
<p class="orv_line">right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t mean it like this.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Main Scenario #1 - Proof of Value&gt;</p>
<p>Clear Conditions: Kill one or more creatures.</p>
<p>Time Limit: 30 minutes</p>
<p>Reward: 300 coins</p>
<p>Failure: Death</p>
<p>* In this scenario, &#39;bugs&#39; are not treated as &#39;living things&#39;.</p>
<p>* Clearance conditions for this scenario will no longer change.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">When I read it again, the scenario actually changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;killing bugs&#39; that Kim Dokja used is no longer allowed in this scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;H-how can you do this all of a sudden!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did anyone get a different message?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging by the looks on their faces, no one had cleared the scenario.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced in the reader ahjussi&#39;s direction, and he lowered his voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It says I cleared it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, the reader ahjussi was the first to kill the bug, and the scenario was recognized as</p>
<p class="orv_line">cleared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#39;t make a fuss, and pretend you didn&#39;t clear either.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Okay, but you.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shook my head, and his face turned pale.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He must be blaming himself for my death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, my. Then―&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#39;t worry about me. It&#39;s not really me you should be worried about.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The rules have changed, and the person who was supposed to live may to die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The person who was supposed to live.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That is, those who had survived by &#39;killing bugs&#39; in Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No way.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reader ahjussi seemed to have thought of that as well.</p>
「Kim Dokja might die.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">We didn&#39;t yet know if the changed rules were specific to some regions or if they would apply to</p>
<p class="orv_line">the entire scenario area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But now we had to assume the worst. If, in the unlikely event that this change kills Kim Dokja,</p>
<p class="orv_line">thenᅳ</p>
「Someone will have to replace Kim Dokja.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Reader ahjussi asked, his lips trembling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What do we do now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We&#39;ll have to think about it, I don&#39;t know yet.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The terrified people raised their voices to the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We killed a creature, what the hell?&quot;</p>
[A few constellations are giggling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">For the first time, we heard a message from the constellations.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The stunned people looked around in horror.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Deacon Kim Cheolyang, who came rushed over, grabbed me by my shoulders.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Brother, what are we going to do? Is there any other way but the bugs?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not only Kim Cheolyang, but all the other people who were looking for bugs rushed toward me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You got us into this mess! What are we going to do now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Take responsibility!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">They shouted at me. As if I was responsible for this whole mess.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I calmly retorted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because of me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Uh, well, you&#39;re responsible anyway! You&#39;re the reason we&#39;re all going to die!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Calm down. No one&#39;s going to die. Just because the bugs failed doesn&#39;t mean there no a way</p>
<p class="orv_line">out.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re right. I can kill you if I have to.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The big guy who had stopped trampling on the bug was coming toward me, dragging the soles of</p>
<p class="orv_line">his sneakers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at him and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Of course, that&#39;s one option, if you&#39;re willing to deal with the aftermath.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;After that&#39;s over, people will remember the killer.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he was Kim Namwoon, this logic wouldn&#39;t work.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the big guy wasn&#39;t as crazy as Kim Namwoon, and he stopped approaching me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the future, only murderers will survive. However, that&#39;s not something that ordinary people</p>
<p class="orv_line">can easily conclude.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the lack of imagination that I dug into.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then what? We have to kill living things to live.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We can kill something. Not bugs nor people.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What if the conditions change again? We just failed.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They won&#39;t change this time.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How do you know that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Have you even read the scenario?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see people opening the scenario window in a panic.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s true, the conditions won&#39;t change now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Can we believe this?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hadn&#39;t intended to go this far, but now the tables had turned.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There&#39;s going to be a prime minister&#39;s speech on the news soon, and level one national disaster</p>
<p class="orv_line">is going to be declared.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Here&#39;s what he&#39;s going to say.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said like a newscaster, recalling the opening lines of &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39; I&#39;d revised dozens of</p>
<p class="orv_line">times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;To all my fellow citizens, unidentified terrorists are currently active in an unspecified number of</p>
<p class="orv_line">areas, including Seoul.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At my words, people opened their phones and started browsing the internet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly added before they could find the video.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;For your information, the president is already dead, and the prime minister will be killed during</p>
<p class="orv_line">his speech.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Less than a dozen seconds later, someone screamed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The prime minister is really speaking!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The prime minister&#39;s voice came from cell phones everywhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—To all my fellow citizens, unidentified terrorists are currently active in an unspecified number</p>
<p class="orv_line">of areas, including Seoul.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Those were the exact words I spoke. The next sentence was no different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The current government will fight against the terrorists with all means and methods, and there</p>
<p class="orv_line">will be no negotiations. Therefore, the people should go about their daily lives with peace of</p>
<p class="orv_line">mind.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the Prime Minister continued to speak, people looked in my direction as if possessed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;U-uaaak!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A startled citizen dropped his cell phone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The prime minister was dead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His head exploded in real time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What the hell is this.......!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As events unfolded as I said, the big guy stuttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You must have secretly looked it up online.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;W-what are you talking about, it was live!&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How the hell do you know that, brother?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t answer back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A few gunshots rang out, and Bihyung&#39;s face appeared on the screen, replacing the prime</p>
<p class="orv_line">minister.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could hear gulps of breath all around me.</p>
[Everyone, I&#39;ve told you already. This isn&#39;t a game like &#39;terrorism&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I&#39;m sure other readers are seeing the same thing I&#39;m seeing right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But from now on, they were about to see something a little different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">to fix it.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Normally, at this point, the remaining time would be reduced by 10 minutes, and if the first kill</p>
<p class="orv_line">didn&#39;t occur within 5 minutes, a penalty is triggered that wipes out all life in the area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This will not be the case this time around.</p>
「Because the scenario&#39;s clear conditions can no longer be changed.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After the Bureau intervened once to remove the &#39;bugs&#39; from the scenario, the first scenario&#39;s</p>
<p class="orv_line">clearance conditions were completely locked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Therefore, the &#39;time penalty&#39; will not be triggered this time.</p>
[There are 20 minutes remaining.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With a beep, a timer appeared out of thin air, and Bihyung laughed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">your leaders.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, the screen flashed with images of the National Assembly members&#39; heads</p>
<p class="orv_line">exploding.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The frightened people stood back Inhorror.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What the hell is this―&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;U-uwaaa!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A sense of dread settled over the entire station. Strangely enough, the horror actually uplifted me</p>
<p class="orv_line">deeply.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I wanted to write like crazy.</p>
「We gained 10 minutes, so &#39;killing bugs&#39; wasn&#39;t all for nothing.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If I survive this, I might write the side story.</p>
