            <div class="orv_title"><h1>778 Episode 35 Demon King Qualifications (4)</h1></div>
[You came to find me.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja stared blankly at his clone and tilted his head.</p>
[But no matter how much I think about it, it doesn&#39;t make sense.]</p></div>
[What?]</p></div>
[How can you exist here?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even if the time of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; moved toward the &#39;empty space&#39; of the story, this was a nonsensical story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Whether it was 51% or 49%, all of Kim Dokja&#39;s soul fragments were disintegrated and scattered into space.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It became the &lt;Star Stream&gt; itself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it weren&#39;t for the novel written by Han Sooyoung, Kim Dokja wouldn&#39;t have survived now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But how could 49% of his clone exist in such a distant place?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What&#39;s even stranger is that the clone in front of him feels like it existed much longer than that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The clone answered.</p>
[If you exist, it wouldn’t be so strange if I exist.]</p></div>
[Han Sooyoung didn’t write stories like that.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The look in the clone’s eyes changed subtly.</p>
[Of course.]</p></div>
[You are me. I am you. If Han Sooyoung’s story had been successful, we should have been restored as one person.]</p></div>
[It’s simple. We are no longer &#39;one&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">We are not one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja thought about those words for a moment and then said.</p>
[Let’s go back. There are people waiting for us.]</p></div>
[They must be people waiting for you.]</p></div>
[What nonsense are you talking about?]</p></div>
[Remove your hand and leave.]</p></div>
[What?]</p></div>
[The world you are trying to intervene in now is &#39;my world&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did Kim Dokja look at the &#39;Void Curtain&#39; that he had placed his hand on. The world inside this &#39;Void Curtain&#39; was a world that even Kim Dokja, who had been the oldest dream, did not know about.</p>
「How could a world he did not know exist?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The realization came a little too late. The answer to the question was simple.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because his clone in front of him had become this world’s &#39;oldest dream&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He had watched over this world so that it could come to life and its characters could live.</p>
[I see. You… don’t want this world to end, do you?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The clone didn’t answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja let out a light sigh and added.</p>
[You can imagine this place even when you go back. So let’s go back. I’ll read this story with you. You don’t have to carry it alone—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Since when did it start? The clone that had the same &#39;Unbreakable Faith&#39; as his had been aiming at his neck.</p>
[What are you doing?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He was confused.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did the clone harbor such strong hostility toward him?</p>
[I just said it. This is my &#39;world&#39;. I don’t want to read it with you.]</p></div>
[Where is your world, my world? You…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He has used [Avatar] many times before, but this has never happened before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A clone that has escaped the control of the main body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was like him yesterday, or him the day before yesterday, suddenly declaring, &#39;I am Kim Dokja&#39;.</p>
[You really.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja thought of Han Sooyoung’s avatar that he had met in the 1,863rd round a long time ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That Han Sooyoung had also escaped the control of the main body and had her own ego.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What if the clone in front of him had become that kind of case?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja smiled and asked.</p>
[Who are you?]</p></div>
[What?]</p></div>
[Who gathered you?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The clone’s pupils wavered for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja didn’t miss the gap and asked.</p>
[As I said, Han Sooyoung has never written a story about you existing like this. That means…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja slowly raised his voice and spoke.</p>
[Before Han Sooyoung wrote the novel, someone must have collected my &#39;soul&#39;.]</p></div>
[Nonsense.]</p></div>
[Well. Whether this is nonsense or not, it seems like the beings behind you are explaining it.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja could clearly feel it. The ominous and distant feeling behind the clone&#39;s back.</p>
[Everyone, run away! Run away!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations surrounding them began to sway.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The absolute beings of the universe that made even those constellations tremble in fear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was something that held such a powerful aura that it could even be a threat to him, the &#39;oldest dream&#39;.</p>
[I wondered who they were.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja frowned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The abyss of this universe is vast. No matter how much he is the &#39;oldest dream&#39;, there are beings in this universe who escape his observation or live hidden between the lines.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Beings who are more afraid of being recorded than anyone else, and at the same time, who want to take over the record more than anyone else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were definitely those beings behind the clone right now.</p>
[I don&#39;t know who tricked you, but you&#39;re being fooled right now.]</p></div>
[It doesn&#39;t matter.]</p></div>
[It doesn&#39;t matter? Really?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja, who had been silently enduring, couldn&#39;t hold it in this time.</p>
[There are people waiting for us. Are you thinking of betraying them?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The clone he left behind was &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; who existed for &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;. Kim Dokja couldn&#39;t accept the fact that such a clone refused to return to &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;.</p>
[What those people want is you, not me.]</p></div>
[You&#39;re me too.]</p></div>
[&#39;You&#39;re me too&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The clone smiled subtly once again.</p>
[I think it’s time for me to say that.]</p></div>
[What?]</p></div>
[What do you think &#39;real&#39; is?]</p></div>
[Are you suddenly going to have a philosophical conversation?]</p></div>
[If having just a few more percent of memories is what separates &#39;real&#39; and &#39;fake&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The tension slowly began to boil over in the clone’s entire body. The entire universe rippled and heated up dangerously.</p>
[I think the &#39;clone&#39; is you now.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja nodded, watching Kim Dokja aim at him once again.</p>
[Aha, so now the &#39;real&#39; is you?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Two Kim Dokjas aim their swords at each other.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Identical coats, identical Unbreakable Faiths.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only thing that sets them apart is the meaning contained in those beliefs.</p>
[You haven’t forgotten, have you? You’re not 51% anymore.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja nodded with a grin.</p>
[You’re not the 49% I knew.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As if announcing the start of war, a meteor fell from somewhere.</p>
「And the fight began.」</p></div>
<hr>
「Then who the hell am I?」</p></div>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah clearly remembered the moment she first came into this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was at the theater that day. She wasn’t planning to watch a movie, but to attend some fan event.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Hey, this is my first time here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She contacted her partner nervously at the theater entrance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her partner’s name was Go Jangwon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His nickname was Go Janggo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was because he often said things that sounded like his head was broken.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Go Jang. Where are you now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I took the subway</p>
<p class="orv_line">—What station</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Actually, I just got out of the house.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I’m going to go back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Young-in, we can wait. You know?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Just die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While wondering why she had come to like this guy, she was very excited about today’s schedule. After today&#39;s event, they should eat something delicious together and go to a cafe and talk about novels all day.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With that thought, she opened the theater door. Not knowing what would happen to her after that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It still doesn&#39;t feel real.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah clenched and unclenched her fists several times while muttering bitterly to herself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Several months had already passed since that day.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And she had changed a lot in those months. She no longer talked to strangers. When someone approached her, she was wary, suspicious, and even prepared to kill them if necessary.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a world where she couldn&#39;t survive if she didn&#39;t do that, and she survived.</p>
「Only to meet Go Jangwon again.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah looked down at the fallen Cheon Inho. No, he was no longer Cheon Inho. His appearance, his physique, and the items he was wearing now resembled &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; more than anyone else.</p>
[Story fragment &#39;A Certain Beginning&#39; is shaking!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja, who was injected with a story fragment, did not stop convulsing as if he had completely lost his senses.</p>
「A Certain Beginning.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It had been a few weeks since she had obtained this story fragment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While she was hunting monsters as usual and absorbing the souls of readers who died during the scenario to gain strength, a familiar being appeared in her dreams.</p>
【Honestly, I didn&#39;t know you would survive this far.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Representative Kim Dokja?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The being I once met in a dream &#39;theater&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, should I call you &#39;Asmodeus&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seon-ah was now able to see through his true identity. It was the result of gathering information from Ye Hyunwoo and other readers and making her own deductions.</p>
[Oh. Am I already that famous?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What&#39;s your business?&quot;</p>
[I have a &#39;fragment&#39; I want to give you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah obtained 「A Certain Beginning」 at that time. Unfortunately, most of the fragments were lost, so she couldn&#39;t obtain complete memories. However, it wasn&#39;t hard to guess what happened even with the legend with holes here and there.</p>
「Kim Dokja and Kim Dokja fought.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As a result of that confrontation, the &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; she knew was torn into several pieces.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah looked down at the convulsing Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this person really that &#39;Kim Dokja&#39;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus, who gave her memories, described him like this.</p>
【He is 49% Kim Dokja, the cause of all this.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah quietly observed Kim Dokja. However, no matter how much she observed, she still felt like she didn’t understand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The more she thought about it, the more things didn’t make sense.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this guy was really 49% Kim Dokja, why did he lose all his memories and come here? No, wasn’t this guy a reader who had been living in reality with her and then possessed a character in this world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What was most unsettling was that there was a subtle difference that she couldn’t explain between the &#39;49% Kim Dokja&#39; she had confirmed in her memories and the &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; in front of her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah, I don’t know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah slowly brought her hand to Kim Dokja’s neck.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She’ll know if she absorbs it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was only one thing for sure. This man in front of her now had more &#39;Kim Dokja fragments&#39; than she had ever collected. If she could get these &#39;Kim Dokja fragments&#39;, she would get closer to the one and only Kim Dokja than anyone else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Then I can find the cause.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah took deep breaths.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her hands kept shaking. This was because she had never taken the &#39;Kim Dokja fragment&#39; of a living incarnation before. The &#39;Kim Dokja fragments&#39; she had taken were all of the readers who were on the verge of death or had gone mad.</p>
「&quot;Take my memories.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was the same when she absorbed Christina.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Christina, who faced death while carrying out the &lt;Twelve Zodiac Signs&gt; scenario, entrusted the &#39;Kim Dokja fragment&#39; she had to Goo Seonah.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She took on the burden. The more she embraced it, the stronger she became.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;You can do it. Come to your senses.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah slapped her own cheek several times. She must do it. She must absorb it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s how she can become strong. That&#39;s how she can get her friend back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, Goo Seonah, who had made up her mind, reached out her hand once more.</p>
[The story &#39;Heir of the Eternal Name&#39; rejects you!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A feeling of something biting her hand came along, along with a surge of excitement.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsk tsk tsk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And Kim Dokja&#39;s memories began to come back. Some memories were sad, and some were painful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were also memories she knew.</p>
「&quot;Seonah-ssi. Don&#39;t make Inho-ssi too uncomfortable. He&#39;s not someone who would lie.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The more she examined her memories, the more she felt that something was wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was it really the right thing to absorb this guy? Wasn&#39;t what she said actually right? Wasn&#39;t it necessary for someone to become the only Kim Dokja?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment she thought that.</p>
[The story &#39;Recorder of Things That Will Disappear&#39; begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Goo Seonah encountered a story in a corner of his memory.</p>
「Yeong-in-ah. We can date. You know?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was the voice of Go Jangwon that she had been looking for.</p>
