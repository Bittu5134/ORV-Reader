<br>
<p class="orv_line">Episode 9. Words That Can't Be Said</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">It was around the time I was writing the episode 'Disaster of Floods'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When Kim Dokja was beaten and his intestines were torn off by the 41st turn Shin Yooseung, Ji</p>
<p class="orv_line">Eunyoo said something like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">stomach?"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know what I said then.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I think I said something like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fantasy, you can have your limbs cut off and a hole in your stomach, but your mouth is still</p>
<p class="orv_line">alive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And then I said.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Kim Dokja has the [Fourth Wall]." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even if you don't have the [Fourth Wall], the most important thing is mental strength.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that time, I thought I could overcome anything with mental strength. I believed that if I</p>
<p class="orv_line">couldn't overcome something, it was because I didn't have enough mental strength.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I could go back to that time, I would slap myself in the back of the head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I'm sorry. Kim Dokja-ssi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It hurts a lot.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I begged and begged and begged Kim Dokja, in pain that felt like my body was going to break in</p>
<p class="orv_line">half. How many times did I beg until someone answered.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">「...... ...... ......」</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a very faint voice. I couldn't hear what was being said, but I could clearly see that they</p>
<p class="orv_line">were very compassionate and warm words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The pain eased a little.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In my blurry vision, I could see a thread wrapped around my stomach. I brought my hand to the</p>
<p class="orv_line">warm threads.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Beyond the fluttering thread, brown hair fluttered like flower petals.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 ...... ...... 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to ask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who are you, where am I?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did you save me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 ...... ...... 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My consciousness continued to drift, the words slipping away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt someone hold my hand, and something inside me stirred and rose. Like it was [Incite], it</p>
<p class="orv_line">was like a weight had been lifted off me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I can't do this alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I can't change the world, I can't protect people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to say, please help me, protect the people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then the person on the other side of the thread spoke.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I can't. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi! Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I opened my eyes, Kyung Sein and Jung Heewon were in front of me.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">"He's awake! Inho-ssi woke up too!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Chungmuro.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed that I had safely returned to the place where my body was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I casually looked down at my stomach, which was safe and sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What the hell is going on? Everyone suddenly collapsed, and Inho-ssi wouldn't wake up......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon sighed heavily as she held my shoulder tightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No one had told Jung Heewon what we'd been through, judging by the way Kyung Sein was</p>
<p class="orv_line">avoiding my eyes. Perhaps it was a natural judgment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi. Are you okay? Did you hit your head somewhere?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No. I'm fine, thank you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon put her hand on my forehead and stood up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Stay here for a while, I'll get you something to drink."</p>
<p class="orv_line">While Jung Heewon was gone, Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi quickly sat down next to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi, you've been there all this time, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes...... But wait a minute."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I closed my eyes for a moment and organized what had happened in my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were four main pieces of information I learned from the 'theater'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One, in the theater, the 'kkoma Kim Dokjas' are watching us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Two, 'RepresentativeKimDokja' has a grudge against Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Three, 'RepresentativeKimDokja' is a 'character'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Four, someone saved me from 'RepresentativeKimDokja'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Each piece of information was shocking and hard to put into context.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All I know is that 'RepresentativeKimDokja' is up to something, and he's using us to plan</p>
<p class="orv_line">something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And......</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 ...... Company! 」</p></div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">After hearing that last part, I lost consciousness, and I don't remember exactly what happened</p>
<p class="orv_line">after that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could barely remember that someone escorted me out of that space.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A few deductions flashed through my mind, then quickly disappeared.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 No way. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When I opened my eyes, Kyung Sein chimed in as if she'd been waiting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi, he brought us here, right? RepresentativeKimDokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. It looks like it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn't see him like that, but I'm really disappointed. How many times did I read the</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Encyclopedia of Omniscient Reader' that he wrote—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was about to say that this RepresentativeKimDokja and that RepresentativeKimDokja must be</p>
<p class="orv_line">different people, but I shut my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It didn't matter at this point.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But he said that if we somehow prevented the destruction, he would let us go home......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will 'RepresentativeKimDokja' keep his promise?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I had to guess, I'd say that since he's an 'outer god', and we have an 'outer world covenant', his</p>
<p class="orv_line">promise is valid.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That is, if we somehow managed to prevent the scenario's destruction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I thought Inho-ssi was in trouble because you woke up late. Did anything happen?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I kept the story short, leaving out the details. There were a lot of people around, and I didn't think</p>
<p class="orv_line">it was the right time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't know if it's a bug or what, but I was the only one there for a while, even after everyone</p>
<p class="orv_line">else disappeared."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho mate, maybe."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At my words, Dansoo ahjussi squeezed my hand. I held his hand back lightly and shook my</p>
<p class="orv_line">head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm sorry, I didn't find Jiyoon."</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi's expression quickly darkened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's not time to give up just yet. There were a lot of kids around Jiyoon's age that I didn't get to</p>
<p class="orv_line">talk to."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Really?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">To tell the truth, there weren't that many people that were Jiyoon's age, but it wouldn't do any</p>
<p class="orv_line">good to tell him that now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein also helped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's right. Ahjussi. Plus this world is 'Omniscient Reader's. Even if the worst comes to the</p>
<p class="orv_line">worst, there's always a way out."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You're right, Sein-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">This world is Omniscient Reader's.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If someone dies here, it doesn't mean they're dead forever.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are constellations in this world that rule the afterlife, and all dead souls go there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I wonder if my readers and I can go to the underworld.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe, like the 41st turn Shin Yooseung, we will be lost in the world without going anywhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I thought about it, I suddenly felt fear.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Where did all the readers who have already died go? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As I stared blankly at the stairwell leading upstairs, I saw the 7th Apostle Ye Hyunwoo</p>
<p class="orv_line">descending with some people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi, are you up?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I bowed slightly as he rushed over to greet me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After glancing around, Ye Hyunwoo whispered in a low voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi, you were 'there' too, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's a pity. If I knew your face, I would have greeted you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps Ye Hyunwoo was also in the theater. Which one of them he was, I don't know. Some</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">readers would know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There will be another chance next time. What's going on?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a bustle of people coming down from upstairs. Voices shouting with urgency. I could</p>
<p class="orv_line">see them busily moving materials around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, that."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging by the hardened expression on Ye Hyunwoo's face, something must have happened</p>
<p class="orv_line">while I was asleep.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon ran over with water from a distance, and her expression was grave.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I got up from my seat, wondering what was going on.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[All the 'green zones' in this region have been destroyed and the main scenario has collapsed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">An unexpected message came through.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The difficulty is automatically adjusted according to the remaining schedule of the scenario.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This can't be happening.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is starting now?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The scenario content is updated!]</p></div>
<br>
<div class="orv_window">
<p></p>
<p>&lt;Main Scenario #3 — Emergency Defense Battle&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Main</p>
<p>Difficulty: BClear Conditions: All the 'green zones' in the region have been destroyed and the monsters that</p>
<p>were going to be created in the remaining days have suddenly run wild. Survive against the flood</p>
<p>of monsters for the remaining time.</p>
<p>Time Limit: 8 hours</p>
<p>Reward: 2,000 coins</p>
<p></p>
<p>Failure: —</p>
<p></p>
</div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I recalled the description of 'Emergency Defense Battle' in Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">remaining time would emerge all at once.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The timing was faster than when Kim Dokja fought the 'Emergency Defense Battle'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, we'd have to deal with a much larger number of monsters than he did in</p>
<p class="orv_line">Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A pensive Kyung Sein looked at me and muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I-Inho-ssi. What should we do?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the former Omniscient Reader, Kim Dokja and his group destroyed all the 'green zones', and</p>
<p class="orv_line">an 'emergency defense battle' was held.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But now, there is no Kim Dokja in Chungmuro.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So why did the scenario start?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'green zones' were destroyed too quickly.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The difficulty of 'Emergency Defense Battle' will be adjusted.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[People will be banned from entering the station from now on.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Emergency Defense Battle' will begin in five minutes!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, we were given time to prepare.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly looked back at my companions and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's okay. Everybody calm down."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if the scenario was more difficult than the original, in the end, the point of 'Emergency</p>
<p class="orv_line">Defense Battle' was to fend off from a group of 9th grade underground species 'ground rats' and</p>
<p class="orv_line">8th grade underground species 'grolls'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that case, the situation was not bad.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Thanks to Ye Hyunwoo's performance, we had Gong Pildu's assistance, and most importantly,</p>
<p class="orv_line">we had.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We have the strongest card, don't we?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo asked with a smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you happen to have a hidden hand?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm talking about Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 41st turn Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the monster who could beat a poisonous rhinoceros from the beginning teamed up with Gong</p>
<p class="orv_line">Pildu, 'Emergency Defense Battle' would be no problem.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, whether or not Yoo Joonghyuk would help us is a separate story, but judging by the</p>
<p class="orv_line">atmosphere so far.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kids, get up! Now is not the time to play around! Dammit. This is why I was......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu's shout rang out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The people who had gotten the artillery from somewhere began to quickly build up a fort in the</p>
<p class="orv_line">middle of the platform.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But...... Where did Yoo Joonghyuk go?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo's expression was dark as he turned around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn't tell you earlier. Why I was fighting with Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't get to hear Ye Hyunwoo's story because we were suddenly summoned by</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn't fight him because I wanted to. As a reader who finished the story, there's no way I</p>
<p class="orv_line">would choose to fight that monster."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That bastard tried to destroy all of Chungmuro's 'green zones'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I got a little goosebumps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the 41st turn, Yoo Joonghyuk should have known that 'Emergency Defense Battle' would</p>
<p class="orv_line">start when all of Chungmuro's 'green zones' were destroyed.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">"Where is Yoo Joonghyuk?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He went upstairs. When we were asleep, he smashed all the remaining green zones."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, someone tapped me on the shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uh, ahjussi. You woke up?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Lee Jihye.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Master said to tell you. Hmmmm."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Clearing her throat, Lee Jihye put her hands on her hips and mimicked Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you're really Cheon Inho, you can do this alone."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't need to ask what she meant by that.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Emergency Defense Battle' has begun!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye added with a smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then I'll be watching over there."</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, Lee Jihye jumped up to the top of the stairwell.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, I wanted her to help, but I didn't have time to convince her right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu called out in a loud voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Here we go. Gather round, everyone!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a relief to have him on our side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Standing next to me, Ye Hyunwoo said in a low voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't worry too much. I've been working hard since the first day to prepare for something like</p>
<p class="orv_line">this. Although we're a little ahead of schedule......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo climbed onto the fort and stood tall like an experienced captain, instructing</p>
<p class="orv_line">everyone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Take your positions! We'll go as we practiced this morning!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, they had already practiced the formation, so they didn't panic and prepared to take</p>
<p class="orv_line">cover behind the fort.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I was impressed again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a different atmosphere from the one Geumho Station had when I left.</p>
<p class="orv_line">People moving in an orderly fashion, like a well-trained army.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered what kept them so united.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who protects our land?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We protect it!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered in hindsight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's right. Chungmuro was like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A fortress of the 'Landlord Alliance', controlled by the landowner Gong Pildu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Ye Hyunwoo who commanded the fortress now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"According to my calculations, this is around the fourth stage of the Invincible Castellan</p>
<p class="orv_line">techtree, and with the synergy of the Invincible Siege Formation, we should be able to handle</p>
<p class="orv_line">Emergency Defense Battle. We're still at the third stage of the techtree, but at this rate, we'll be</p>
<p class="orv_line">there soonᅳ"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't understand why this guy is still only the 7th Apostle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King should immediately give up his 2nd place to Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We'll help too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi exchanged glances as they each grabbed their weapons.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">And Jung Heewon, standing in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't step up and recover, and stay well hidden behind me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein stepped forward with her shield, and Dansoo ahjussi gathered the bugs with his</p>
<p class="orv_line">bamboo stick.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And as I watched Ye Hyunwoo adjusting his formation next to Gong Pildu, I suddenly</p>
<p class="orv_line">remembered RepresentativeKimDokja's words.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "All he cares about is the life and death of &lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt;." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">His words weren't entirely audible. In the end, the only thing Kim Dokja was able to save was</p>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt;, and in fact, he couldn't even do that properly.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">But his story was recorded and told. And there were readers who read the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">People who remembered better than anyone else how they fought and what kind of life they</p>
<p class="orv_line">lived.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 And so, the story is not over yet. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, the cries of ground rats could be heard, followed by an ominous vibration coming</p>
<p class="orv_line">from the tunnel side of the station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Everyone, defend your land thoroughly! Gong Pildu ahjussi and I will take care of the rest!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the darkness, I could see the ground rats swarming like a flock of cockroaches.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After completing the inspection of [Private Property] and [Armed Zone], Ye Hyunwoo sent out</p>
<p class="orv_line">the signal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Fire!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Emergency Defense Battle began.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">From downstairs came the sound of the firing of mini-turrets.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The woman bit the candy in her mouth with a crackling sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She dusted herself off and stood up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's started. We should get going."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' asks if you're really not going to help.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Why help them? Our purpose is not to help them, have you forgotten already?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' nods hesitantly.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"We don't have time to help them in the first place, you saw where that sunfish bastard went."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The woman in the white coat glared up at the stairs to the upper level.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' says that sneaky bastard is a problem.]</p></div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The woman pulled out a new lemon-flavored candy and said, biting it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He's growing faster than I thought. If he gets stronger here, he could be hard to control."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' is in deep thought.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Our only chance is now. If he goes 'there', he'll surely show an opening."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The woman looked back down the stairwell one last time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho and the people from Chungmuro were fighting a bloody battle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The woman stared at the scene for a moment, as if trying to hold it in her eyes, before turning</p>
<p class="orv_line">away and saying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This ends the 41st turn."</p>
