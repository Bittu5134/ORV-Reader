<p class="orv_line">Bullets flew from somewhere and rained down on his head. The cargo&#x27;s surprise commission accomplishments evacuated the incarnation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What kind of guy—!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, shells more than twice the amount of charge poured out. It was not ordinary bullets.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Each magical bullet was filled with concentrated magical energy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As several incarnations fell after being attacked, the enraged constellations looked in the direction where the fire started.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Those scum-like incarnations—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations dressed as refugees continued shooting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Keep shooting.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a man standing in the center of the refugees.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jacob Martinez.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Las Vegas’s &#x27;King of the North&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The great-grade constellations, running at remarkable speed, quickly broke through the ranks of refugees and rushed at Martinez. </p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Martinez opened his eyes, the great-grade constellations in each direction cut off Martin so ez&#x27;s arms and torso.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hahaha! You idiot!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The severed limbs along with the blood flowed through the air.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character &#x27;Jacob Martinez&#x27; activates &#x27;Cutting Magic Lv.7&#x27;!]</div>[The character 'Jacob Martinez' activates 'Cutting Magic Lv.7'!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Martinez, who quickly put the cut off limbs back together, looked toward the back and spoke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We can’t take too long. The opponent is &lt;Olympus&gt;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Go. With this, the North has paid its debt.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The woman nodded her head and hugged the fallen Demon King of Salvation. Her body trembled as he entered the process of extinction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don’t move.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation looked up at the woman. An off-white color that shines brightly even on the battlefield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#x27;t the face he remembered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I thought it was Yoo Sangah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu laughed heartily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I am her incarnation.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnation of Yoo Sangah. Maybe that&#x27;s why the atmosphere strangely resembles Yoo Sangah.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s dangerous out here. If you’re here to save the youngest, you’re in the wrong place. The youngest is over there—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They’re still negotiating with the &#x27;recycling center&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Are the negotiations still not over?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then the situation was not good.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A situation where &lt;Olympus&gt; resurrected Ares by burning a giant fire. If he doesn’t send the youngest up quickly—</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is that all you have to say?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu said as she ran while holding the Demon King of Salvation in her arms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There’s something I need to say first.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">An incarnation that resembles Yoo Sangah not only in her mood but also in her tone of voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu continued her words with a light sigh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I was asked to keep an eye on you because you might still do something like this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;She wanted to use the Golden Headband, but she also asked me to tell you that it’s a pity that she couldn’t do that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Golden Headband.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation opened his mouth without realizing it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I am not the Kim Dokja that Yoo Sangah is looking for.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As he said those words, the Demon King of Salvation thought of the third child. The third child had the main memory related to the &#x27;Headband&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As if that person isn’t Yoo Sangah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the rapidly rushing scenery, the Demon King of Salvation felt his stories dispersing.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; continues with a stutter.]</div>[The story 'Demon King of Salvation' continues with a stutter.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu&#x27;s hand wrapped around him and held on to the scattered stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You are the Kim Dokja she is looking for.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a very warm hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’ve read more stories about you than anyone else, so I guarantee you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it because the woman telling that story really looked like Yoo Sangah?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation slowly opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How is Yoo Sangah?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you okay?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Tell her I’m sorry.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Please tell her directly.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You say you are the incarnation of Yoo Sangah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You heard I’m not Yoo Sangah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;For now, let’s assume you’re Yoo Sangah. So—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah cannot come here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He doesn&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the &#x27;scale of probability&#x27; or the restrictions of the &#x27;Void Veil&#x27;, but at least she won&#x27;t be able to come until he dies.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps his words will not be conveyed properly to Yoo Sangah.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thank you so much, Yoo Sangah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">But at least it will remain as a story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And one day, Yoo Sangah will read his story left on this wall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation was satisfied with that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Really, thank you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">His scenario is now over.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now the protagonist and characters of this story have changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t know what you’re thankful for .&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nonetheless, the story continues.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m going to ask, so make sure you’re alive until then.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it because there is still a story left unfinished?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation slowly blinked his eyes and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is that what Yoo Sangah just said?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That’s just what I said?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You are just the incarnation of Yoo Sangah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I just decided to be Yoo Sangah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu said, kicking the ground with all her might and running.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t know, but Yoo Sangah would definitely have said that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The explosion sound coming from behind was gradually fading away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The northern king&#x27;s troops were annihilated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I heard about you from my youngest.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Editor Ji Eunyu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In his youngest&#x27;s memory, she was quite an important figure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was the first to read and edit the stories the youngest wrote. Perhaps, without her, his &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27;s Viewpoint&#x27; written by his youngest would not have been possible.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Writer, look. Kim Dokja’s lines here are a bit strange.&quot;」</div>「"Writer, look. Kim Dokja’s lines here are a bit strange."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think this line suits him.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No! Look, he wasn’t a character who spoke like this before—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Isn’t that the character’s three-dimensionality?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is not three-dimensional, it’s a kabung.&quot;」</p>
<p class="orv_line">A thought suddenly occurred to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he and Yoo Sangah had been reincarnated in a different world, wouldn&#x27;t they have been like that?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Doesn’t Kim Dokja want to be someone else sometimes?」</div>「Doesn’t Kim Dokja want to be someone else sometimes?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">A world without scenarios and constellations. A world where all these tragedies are just imagination in the lines of text.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The youngest came from that world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You stayed here to save the youngest?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu did not answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You’re like the youngest Yoo Sangah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m not Yoo Sangah. Stop talking. The story will be scattered.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m going to die anyway. There’s less than a minute left.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu’s steps stopped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The great-grade constellations hidden in the front line appeared one by one. Additional great-grade constellations dispatched from &lt;Olympus&gt; appeared accompanied by their incarnations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Turn off [Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint] and run away! That’s it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No. I’ve put restrictions on it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is different from the general [Omniscient Reader&#x27;s Viewpoint].</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation risked his own life to kill the incarnations of great-grade and kill the incarnation of Ares, a narrative-grade constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This [Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint] cannot be canceled on its own.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, when this incarnation body disappears, it also disappears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What on earth were you thinking? You’re the one they’re after.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then why—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did he do such an unreasonable thing?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation doesn&#x27;t know much either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He may have believed that his stage was not over yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He may have wanted to recreate the days when he was hunting down constellations as the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When hesaw the story of the youngest fighting desperately alone, his blood boiled without him knowing, and he may have wanted to prove that he, too, was a &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#x27;Thoughts&#x27; borrowed from the youngest hummed and cried.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The Demon King of Salvation I know never dies.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You know that he is a person who survives no matter what he does, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Great-grade constellations approached from all directions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no place to run now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was  no way for them to escape unless the &#x27;star ladder&#x27; came down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what star would dare to lower the &#x27;star ladder&#x27; against the &#x27;giant nebula&#x27;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So please save him.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Ji Eunyu said those words, her gaze rested on Cheon Inho in the distance for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Please, save Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation listened to those words blankly. Perhaps he came all the way here because he wanted to hear those words.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; wants to continue its storytelling.]</div>[The story 'Demon King of Salvation' wants to continue its storytelling.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation, who stumbled out of Ji Eunyu&#x27;s arms, spoke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Beyond the incarnations of great-grade constellations that surrounded them, a man with a fearsome appearance was walking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Demon—King—of—Salvation&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the resurrected incarnation of Ares.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ares walked forward, enduring aftereffects that exceeded the probability limit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if all his remaining stories were exploded, it was impossible to defeat him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thunder struck once again across the night sky. The Demon King of Salvation thought of Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps Yoo Jonghyuk or Kim Dokja Company will not be able to come. Because the giant nebulae will be blocking them by sacrificing their giant stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not only them, but no one else in this world can intervene in this scenario where the giant nebulae run rampant.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Except for only one place.」</div>「Except for only one place.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation raised his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you there?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">They are the group that controls this &#x27;world&#x27; itself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Those who control the scenario in the torrent of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; and guide the world to the ◼️◼️ of everything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Bihyung.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sparks struck in the air at the call of the Demon King of Salvation. And,</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Are you serious?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung, a dokkaebi belonging to the &#x27;Management Bureau&#x27; responded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation knew. Bihyung is probably not the only one listening to him now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The great dokkaebis of this world line— even perhaps the dokkaebi king beyond—are also listening to his story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And what he&#x27;s going to say, he&#x27;s already guessing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The price will be very high.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He knows. Perhaps it would be more cruel than death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It does not matter.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, he has to meet his youngest again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When they meet, he has to tell him what he hasn&#x27;t  told him yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What kind of person is the &#x27;real Kim Dokja&#x27;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Where is Han Sooyoung, whom he was searching for?</p>
<p class="orv_line">How can readers from other world lines be sent back?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who is the guy who killed us?	</p>
<p class="orv_line">And—</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Why does this &#x27;world&#x27; exist?」</div>「Why does this 'world' exist?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations noticed something unusual and rushed towards this direction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That bastard! Stop him—!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at them, the Demon King of Salvation grinned.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「You will get nothing.」</div>「You will get nothing.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation declared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will dedicate myself to the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then the world responded to his words.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The &lt;Star Stream&gt; accepts your offer.]</div>[The <Star Stream> accepts your offer.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">&quot;Stop! You bastard!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fact that the constellation sealed itself in the &#x27;Star Stream&#x27; was tantamount to voluntarily becoming the subject of a scenario.</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[The &#x27;Administrative Bureau&#x27; approves your payment.]</div>[The 'Administrative Bureau' approves your payment.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ares arrived right in front of the Demon King of Salvation and swung his spear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a split second, a dazzling beam of light appeared and the incarnation of the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, a bright ladder began to come down from thin air.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Star Ladder.」</div>「Star Ladder.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">An opportunity to ascend to heaven given to several incarnations in exchange for the constellation &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft and Selena Kim climbed the ladder to help Cheon Inho and Yoo Jonghyuk, who had fallen, and Ji Eunyu also held onto the ladder with Martinez.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ladder carrying all the scheduled incarnations began to ascend to the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Coo coo coo coo!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ares was furious and went berserk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I can’t admit it!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ares&#x27;s angry body stretched out his hand toward the star ladder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Stop it! Stop his incarnation from using the star ladder! Just make him drop it somehow!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Great-grade constellations, including the gatekeeper of Thebes, belatedly attacked the ladder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, a translucent curtain created sparks and blocked their intervention.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How dare you—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, Ares felt like the scales of the scenario were balanced.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was impossible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If there is a being who can achieve equilibrium with a narrative-grade constellation—</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Stop, Ares.]</div>[Stop, Ares.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">All the constellations, including Ares, stopped along with their incarnations at the mantra filled with tremendous power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ares lifted his head and looked up at the sky in disbelief.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the end of the star ladder leading to the &#x27;recycling center&#x27; were beings with pure white wings spread out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unlike &lt;Olympus&gt; and &lt;Asgard&gt;, which participated in the scenario, these stars were the only ones among the three giant nebulae that remained silent.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Especially at this timing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ares bit his lip and revealed his fierceness to the being standing beyond the archangels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Center Director! I know you’re hiding there!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is no need to fight &lt;Eden&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, the &#x27;Star Ladder&#x27; is not under the jurisdiction of &lt;Eden&gt;.</p>
