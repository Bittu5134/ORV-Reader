<p class="orv_line">Bullets flew from somewhere and rained down on his head. The cargo's surprise commission accomplishments evacuated the incarnation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What kind of guy—!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, shells more than twice the amount of charge poured out. It was not ordinary bullets.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Each magical bullet was filled with concentrated magical energy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As several incarnations fell after being attacked, the enraged constellations looked in the direction where the fire started.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Those scum-like incarnations—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations dressed as refugees continued shooting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Keep shooting."</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a man standing in the center of the refugees.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jacob Martinez.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Las Vegas’s 'King of the North'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The great-grade constellations, running at remarkable speed, quickly broke through the ranks of refugees and rushed at Martinez. </p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Martinez opened his eyes, the great-grade constellations in each direction cut off Martin so ez's arms and torso.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hahaha! You idiot!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The severed limbs along with the blood flowed through the air.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Jacob Martinez' activates 'Cutting Magic Lv.7'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Martinez, who quickly put the cut off limbs back together, looked toward the back and spoke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We can’t take too long. The opponent is <Olympus>."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Go. With this, the North has paid its debt."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The woman nodded her head and hugged the fallen Demon King of Salvation. Her body trembled as he entered the process of extinction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don’t move."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation looked up at the woman. An off-white color that shines brightly even on the battlefield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't the face he remembered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I thought it was Yoo Sangah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu laughed heartily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am her incarnation."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnation of Yoo Sangah. Maybe that's why the atmosphere strangely resembles Yoo Sangah.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s dangerous out here. If you’re here to save the youngest, you’re in the wrong place. The youngest is over there—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"They’re still negotiating with the 'recycling center'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Are the negotiations still not over?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then the situation was not good.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A situation where <Olympus> resurrected Ares by burning a giant fire. If he doesn’t send the youngest up quickly—</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is that all you have to say?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu said as she ran while holding the Demon King of Salvation in her arms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There’s something I need to say first."</p>
<p class="orv_line">An incarnation that resembles Yoo Sangah not only in her mood but also in her tone of voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu continued her words with a light sigh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I was asked to keep an eye on you because you might still do something like this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"She wanted to use the Golden Headband, but she also asked me to tell you that it’s a pity that she couldn’t do that."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Golden Headband.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation opened his mouth without realizing it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am not the Kim Dokja that Yoo Sangah is looking for."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As he said those words, the Demon King of Salvation thought of the third child. The third child had the main memory related to the 'Headband'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"As if that person isn’t Yoo Sangah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the rapidly rushing scenery, the Demon King of Salvation felt his stories dispersing.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Demon King of Salvation' continues with a stutter.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu's hand wrapped around him and held on to the scattered stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You are the Kim Dokja she is looking for."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a very warm hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’ve read more stories about you than anyone else, so I guarantee you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it because the woman telling that story really looked like Yoo Sangah?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation slowly opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How is Yoo Sangah?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Tell her I’m sorry."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Please tell her directly."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You say you are the incarnation of Yoo Sangah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You heard I’m not Yoo Sangah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"For now, let’s assume you’re Yoo Sangah. So—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah cannot come here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He doesn't know if it's because of the 'scale of probability' or the restrictions of the 'Void Veil', but at least she won't be able to come until he dies.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps his words will not be conveyed properly to Yoo Sangah.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you so much, Yoo Sangah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">But at least it will remain as a story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And one day, Yoo Sangah will read his story left on this wall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation was satisfied with that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Really, thank you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">His scenario is now over.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now the protagonist and characters of this story have changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don’t know what you’re thankful for ."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nonetheless, the story continues.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m going to ask, so make sure you’re alive until then."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it because there is still a story left unfinished?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation slowly blinked his eyes and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is that what Yoo Sangah just said?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That’s just what I said?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You are just the incarnation of Yoo Sangah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I just decided to be Yoo Sangah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu said, kicking the ground with all her might and running.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don’t know, but Yoo Sangah would definitely have said that."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The explosion sound coming from behind was gradually fading away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The northern king's troops were annihilated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I heard about you from my youngest."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Editor Ji Eunyu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In his youngest's memory, she was quite an important figure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was the first to read and edit the stories the youngest wrote. Perhaps, without her, his 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' written by his youngest would not have been possible.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Writer, look. Kim Dokja’s lines here are a bit strange."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I think this line suits him."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No! Look, he wasn’t a character who spoke like this before—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Isn’t that the character’s three-dimensionality?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This is not three-dimensional, it’s a kabung."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">A thought suddenly occurred to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he and Yoo Sangah had been reincarnated in a different world, wouldn't they have been like that?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Doesn’t Kim Dokja want to be someone else sometimes?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A world without scenarios and constellations. A world where all these tragedies are just imagination in the lines of text.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The youngest came from that world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You stayed here to save the youngest?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu did not answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You’re like the youngest Yoo Sangah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m not Yoo Sangah. Stop talking. The story will be scattered."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m going to die anyway. There’s less than a minute left."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu’s steps stopped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The great-grade constellations hidden in the front line appeared one by one. Additional great-grade constellations dispatched from <Olympus> appeared accompanied by their incarnations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Turn off [Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint] and run away! That’s it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No. I’ve put restrictions on it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is different from the general [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint].</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation risked his own life to kill the incarnations of great-grade and kill the incarnation of Ares, a narrative-grade constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This [Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint] cannot be canceled on its own."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, when this incarnation body disappears, it also disappears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What on earth were you thinking? You’re the one they’re after."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then why—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did he do such an unreasonable thing?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation doesn't know much either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He may have believed that his stage was not over yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He may have wanted to recreate the days when he was hunting down constellations as the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When hesaw the story of the youngest fighting desperately alone, his blood boiled without him knowing, and he may have wanted to prove that he, too, was a 'Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Thoughts' borrowed from the youngest hummed and cried.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The Demon King of Salvation I know never dies."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You know that he is a person who survives no matter what he does, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Great-grade constellations approached from all directions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no place to run now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was  no way for them to escape unless the 'star ladder' came down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what star would dare to lower the 'star ladder' against the 'giant nebula'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"So please save him."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Ji Eunyu said those words, her gaze rested on Cheon Inho in the distance for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Please, save Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation listened to those words blankly. Perhaps he came all the way here because he wanted to hear those words.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Demon King of Salvation' wants to continue its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation, who stumbled out of Ji Eunyu's arms, spoke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Okay."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Beyond the incarnations of great-grade constellations that surrounded them, a man with a fearsome appearance was walking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Demon—King—of—Salvation"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the resurrected incarnation of Ares.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ares walked forward, enduring aftereffects that exceeded the probability limit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if all his remaining stories were exploded, it was impossible to defeat him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thunder struck once again across the night sky. The Demon King of Salvation thought of Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps Yoo Jonghyuk or Kim Dokja Company will not be able to come. Because the giant nebulae will be blocking them by sacrificing their giant stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not only them, but no one else in this world can intervene in this scenario where the giant nebulae run rampant.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Except for only one place.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation raised his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you there?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">They are the group that controls this 'world' itself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Those who control the scenario in the torrent of the <Star Stream> and guide the world to the ◼️◼️ of everything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Bihyung."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sparks struck in the air at the call of the Demon King of Salvation. And,</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Are you serious?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung, a dokkaebi belonging to the 'Management Bureau' responded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation knew. Bihyung is probably not the only one listening to him now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The great dokkaebis of this world line— even perhaps the dokkaebi king beyond—are also listening to his story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And what he's going to say, he's already guessing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The price will be very high.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He knows. Perhaps it would be more cruel than death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It does not matter."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, he has to meet his youngest again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When they meet, he has to tell him what he hasn't  told him yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What kind of person is the 'real Kim Dokja'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Where is Han Sooyoung, whom he was searching for?</p>
<p class="orv_line">How can readers from other world lines be sent back?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who is the guy who killed us?	</p>
<p class="orv_line">And—</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Why does this 'world' exist?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations noticed something unusual and rushed towards this direction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That bastard! Stop him—!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at them, the Demon King of Salvation grinned.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「You will get nothing.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation declared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will dedicate myself to the <Star Stream>."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then the world responded to his words.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The <Star Stream> accepts your offer.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is consecrated to the 'Star Stream'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Stop! You bastard!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fact that the constellation sealed itself in the 'Star Stream' was tantamount to voluntarily becoming the subject of a scenario.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The mayor of 'Jeonsang City' wants to incorporate the 'Demon King of Salvation' into his scenario.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The host of 'Ragnarok' wants to incorporate the 'Demon King of Salvation' into his scenario.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Fallen ruins' owner wants to incorporate the 'Demon King of Salvation' into his scenario.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The creator of the 'Holy Demon War' wants to incorporate the 'Demon King of Salvation' into his scenario.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The director of the 'Recycling Center' wants to incorporate the 'Demon King of Salvation' into his scenario.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He didn't know how he would  be used in which scenario. But now he had offered himself and was entitled to ask for it in return.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I accept the granting authority of the 'Star Ladder'."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Administrative Bureau' approves your payment.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Ares arrived right in front of the Demon King of Salvation and swung his spear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a split second, a dazzling beam of light appeared and the incarnation of the 'Demon King of Salvation' disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, a bright ladder began to come down from thin air.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Star Ladder.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">An opportunity to ascend to heaven given to several incarnations in exchange for the constellation 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft and Selena Kim climbed the ladder to help Cheon Inho and Yoo Jonghyuk, who had fallen, and Ji Eunyu also held onto the ladder with Martinez.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ladder carrying all the scheduled incarnations began to ascend to the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Coo coo coo coo!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ares was furious and went berserk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I can’t admit it!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ares's angry body stretched out his hand toward the star ladder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Stop it! Stop his incarnation from using the star ladder! Just make him drop it somehow!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Great-grade constellations, including the gatekeeper of Thebes, belatedly attacked the ladder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, a translucent curtain created sparks and blocked their intervention.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How dare you—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, Ares felt like the scales of the scenario were balanced.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was impossible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If there is a being who can achieve equilibrium with a narrative-grade constellation—</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Stop, Ares.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">All the constellations, including Ares, stopped along with their incarnations at the mantra filled with tremendous power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ares lifted his head and looked up at the sky in disbelief.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the end of the star ladder leading to the 'recycling center' were beings with pure white wings spread out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unlike <Olympus> and <Asgard>, which participated in the scenario, these stars were the only ones among the three giant nebulae that remained silent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Eden!"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Lilies Blooming on Water Ice' reveals themselves!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A line of constellations was blocking the road leading to the recycling center.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The scenario is over. Without further compromising probability, go back to your own context.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"How dare you, how dare you—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ares couldn't understand. Why is <Eden> involved in this situation?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Especially at this timing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ares bit his lip and revealed his fierceness to the being standing beyond the archangels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Center Director! I know you’re hiding there!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is no need to fight <Eden>.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, the 'Star Ladder' is not under the jurisdiction of <Eden>.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Cancel the Star Ladder! The 'Demon King of Salvation' is ours!"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[No. Now he belongs to the 'Star Stream'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With a hollow laugh, the center director's voice was heard from the archangel's shadow.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[<Olympus>. Have you forgotten the Nebula Agreement? You cannot interfere with the 'Recycling Center' scenario.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Asgard has declared [Fate]. Three [Fate] messages have been sent to him! He cannot avoid them! He—"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The fate that came down to him was to 'die in a loved story'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When all the incarnations completed their ascension, the 'star ladder' began to disperse. The portal to the recycling center was closing little by little.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The center director, with a strange smile, left his last words while looking at the ruined Washington Dome.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I guess that story isn't here.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait! Wait! You guys—"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Star Ladder' has disappeared.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[All scenarios in the 'Washington Dome' area end.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The scales of the scenario are tipped.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The balance of probability is lost.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Ares and the great-grade constellations that were left behind hurriedly looked at each other.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unusual sparks were raging throughout Washington.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Everyone withdraw—"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A potential storm begins to blow!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The aftermath that followed erased  everything in Washington.</p>
