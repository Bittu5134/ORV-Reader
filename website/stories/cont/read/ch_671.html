            <div class="orv_title"><h1>671 Episode 21 Kim Dokja (7)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus, who heard Han Sooyoung's words, laughed as if it was absurd.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Do you know what you are talking about?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung did not answer. This is because it was not something she expected him to understand in the first place.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Are you collecting Kim Dokja's fragments for such a ridiculous reason? Trying to get 'Kim Dokja' back, who may or may not come back?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus sounded strangely exasperated.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Have you ever thought about the extras who were messed up by you?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Trampled extras.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung frowned at him.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Think about the people who sacrificed their lives for the humble cause of finding Kim Dokja. I mean, have you ever seen it?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus added mockingly in a somewhat theatrical tone.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have already distorted the world line several times. Do you really think that was the right thing to do?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It is true that they twisted the world line several times, but the worlds they left behind were places where their destructions were all predestined, and they moved in the direction of reducing the planned great tragedy into a possible small tragedy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was the general principle they set.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Does the Kim Dokja you are looking for think the same way as you? Do you think the countless Kim Dokjas who lost their sense of self in the process of collecting the fragments will support you?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung could not understand Asmodeus’s words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While collecting Kim Dokja scattered across the world, &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; never once touched a living Kim Dokja fragment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only things they collected were fragments wandering the universe after failing to reincarnate, and fragments of the story dropped by Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't know. Because I’m not Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, Han Sooyoung did not particularly defend herself. She wondered if there was any use in saying such things. She was already used to being misunderstood.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "You’re afraid that people will still criticize you even after you defend yourself?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja was the only person who accepted Han Sooyoung as a person.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I’m generally a really bad person." 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Who decided this?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What would Kim Dokja say if he saw her now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus spoke as if he knew the answer.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[If you're going to say something so shamelessly, you have to be shameless until the end. At first, you said you would make the world be destroyed as planned, but now you're going to change the planned development?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"That-"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Have you changed your mind after seeing 49% of Kim Dokja?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">49% of Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung's eyes slightly wavered because she didn't know that Asmodeus knew that.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Did you feel sorry for Kim Dokja, whom you abandoned?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even Han Sooyoung, who rarely gets embarrassed, couldn't help but be shaken by that one word.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Two other people got angry in her stead.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer' what you know…]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Lotus Flower Blooming Under the Moonlight' with a beautiful expression…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Lee Gilyoung. Yoo Sangah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At Han Sooyoung’s words, the constellations’ indirect messages faded away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung continued speaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, you’re not wrong. In the end, I couldn’t save that guy."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung remembered the story of 49% Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She wondered if he was born as something other than Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, the guy who got his wish and got a new name, 'Lee Hakhyun'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For some reason, he returned to the world that made him 'Kim Dokja'.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "This kind of conclusion is unacceptable." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This time, not as a 'reader', but as a writer who writes stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What has already happened cannot be undone. All I can send now are lame excuses."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I am not curious about your circumstances.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"But I’m still the author of this story."</p>
<p class="orv_line">What does it mean to write a 'story' in this world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">By changing one line, what is it like to handle the responsibilities that follow?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because she understood the weight better than anyone else, Han Sooyoung decided to pick up the pen before Lee Hakhyun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will destroy the absolute throne."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At least so that Lee Hakhyun does not feel guilty for causing the tragedy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Whether the world line is twisted or the universe is destroyed, I take responsibility for that too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was the only gift she could give to 49% Kim Dokja and writer Lee Hakhyun.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Hmm, I can’t give you the Death Sword as expected.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus shrugged his shoulders at Han Sooyoung as if mocking her, then turned around gracefully and said,</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Because this story is no longer your story. Now, don’t you think so too?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung furrowed her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Either way, Asmodeus continued to talk loudly. It was as if someone was listening to him and his next words.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Do you want to know now? What kind of person is 'Han Sooyoung'? How arbitrary and selfish you are. How deadly a being is in this universe.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The space behind Asmodeus began to tremble.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the space swayed like a silver screen in the wind, it soon illuminated the audience seats of the theater.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Auditorium that can seat hundreds of people</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You-"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kkomas Kim Dokja were sitting in the audience.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you collecting living souls?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus answered Han Sooyoung, who was swallowing her burning anger.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Alive? Aren't these all the readers you killed?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"What nonsense-"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung looked at the kkoma Kim Dokja in the audience. A number so large that it cannot be contained at a glance. The number was greater than all the readers in this world combined.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No way?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment when Han Suyoung, who was in great shape, was about to open her mouth to Asmodeus.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "What are you going to do if you go through the first portal and find Kim Dokja again, who is not good enough? Are you going to believe that the dog is Kim Dokja this time?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A familiar story was heard from somewhere.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "And the fragments of Kim Dokja who imagined that kind of ending, I will go to each and every one of them and torment them until they come up with a proper ending." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">These were all things she said.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I'm going to catch that guy somehow and bring him back. 49%, 51%, I'm tired of playing games of numbers. I have to get 100% now." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After hearing her story, kkomas Kim Dokja were asking her questions.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Why did you throw away 49%? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Her hair stood up. A chill that feels like it's freezing to the bone. It seemed as if the entire world was against her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung resisted the fear and opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She didn't give up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She wanted to say that. But she couldn't write down her words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The probability of the Star Stream was holding her back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus laughed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Do you understand now?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Amidst the sound of the projector running, the questions of kkomas Kim Dokja resounded like a spinning song.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Why did you throw him away? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung realized.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'It seems that they have the same thoughts as him.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">This story has been going according to Asmodeus's script for a long time.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "They are no longer Kim Dokja. They are people who were living in a different world. They each had their own lives." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"You called me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn’t call you, though?"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">What she didn't do.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Do you think the countless Kim Dokjas who lost their sense of self in the process of collecting Kim Dokja’s fragments will also support your cause?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; did not do.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "That guy can’t be the Kim Dokja we know." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A piece of truth cleverly mixed on top of lies. The story is complete.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What on earth have you done?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung stumbled and looked at her audience.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Kim Dokja’s Company' begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">She wanted to let them know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What you saw wasn't everything. All those words probably didn't mean what you understood.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "That guy can’t be the Kim Dokja we know." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung clearly said that.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Just as the 1,863-round me is not the Han Sooyoung you all know." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In order to properly face the 49% Kim Dokja, they had to admit that he was not the Kim Dokja they knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung said that was the way to treat 49% Kim Dokja as a proper person.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She believed it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She wrote it from the perspective of an Omniscient Reader. These were sentences that were not written in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">1%, 49%, 51%.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As long as they are &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt;, there is no Kim Dokja who is not precious to them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She could have said that over and over again. The fact that there is a Kim Dokja in this world that they are looking for does not mean that they are turning away from other Kim Dokjas.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint', she didn't write those words down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because it was not a sentence for just one person, Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And 49% of Kim Dokja said,</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I’m sorry." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja wanted to be the one and only Kim Dokja.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>["I’m sorry, Han Sooyoung."]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Since that couldn't happen, he left them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He quit being Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja, I-"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung opened her mouth for the first time to defend herself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They too would understand if they were 'Kim Dokja'. They will understand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After listening to her story, they will definitely change their mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She had to tell a story. She had to write here some sentences that she didn't write down back then.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But she couldn't think of anything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung looked blankly at the place where the story existed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Memories that disappeared when her [Avatar] disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only sentences that could persuade readers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She has now lost those sentences forever.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This world is such a story. Do you understand?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus was laughing.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This world does not want you. Because you are the villains of this world.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was all viewpoints.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kkoma Kim Dokja is a very small fragment of 'Kim Dokja'. In other words, the stories they read and believe in become the power of this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It becomes probable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsutsu-</p>
<p class="orv_line">The brilliant aura that flowed from the center of the theater was the right hand of Asmodeus.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[So, please stop and die.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung saw Asmodeus like that, and saw the readers beyond him, and she thought of the one person who would be watching this whole story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Good."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung laughed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"After all, I’ve always been the villain."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As she took a deep breath, she could feel her broken body. Now, the probability that was given to her was limited.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Lotus Blooming Under the Moonlight'...]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer'...]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But she was still a writer, and she still had stories to tell.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Maybe Kim Dokja's tastes have changed? The stories you wrote are no longer interesting." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Remembering Lee Hakhyun’s words, Han Sooyoung held on tightly to the Unbreakable Faith left behind by Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What kind of story did Kim Dokja want to see when he came here?</p>
<p class="orv_line">She does not know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps even Kim Dokja himself doesn’t know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is the most helpless god in this universe, unable to do anything but read and reread one story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Go for it, Asmodeus."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung decided to begin her final story for her god.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She said, "Because this time I will take your breath away."</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">rlaehrwk37: Save me Kim Dokja</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I ran through the wind and rain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Black and blue lightning struck continuously in the dark cloud-covered sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All kinds of thoughts ran through my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it's already too late.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it is not too late, what can we do to stop Yoo Jonghyuk?</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I ran until my thighs exploded, I thought of the 'Ways of Survival' in my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as Kim Dokja came up with the 'Ways of Survival' whenever he got stuck in a scenario.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The skill cannot currently be activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Ways of Survival was blocked. Why?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had an ominous feeling. Deafening thunder shook the entire area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bright blue thunderbolts falling one after another.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A huge and probable aftermath was brewing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was an incarnation glimpsed in the center of the storm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I muttered her name absentmindedly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Han Sooyoung?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her body, which had turned pitch black, was falling to the ground.</p>
