<p class="orv_line">For an hour after that, I was beaten up here and there by Han Sooyoung. Maybe because I was beaten up so much, I could answer Han Sooyoung’s questions right away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What major did you choose?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Creative Writing."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, you must have won some awards at the 100th-day celebration when you were young?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Only a reading award. Actually, I never learned writing separately, so I wasn’t very good at writing."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Really? But you must have learned some things when you went to college, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, I did."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Actually, there were people who taught me. Anyway, I graduated from the Creative Writing Department, and I took novel classes from various professors. However, if you ask me if I learned writing from them, I don’t know what to say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there is one professor I remember.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "■■-ah, are you having a hard time these days?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was around the time when I had not received any requests since my lucky debut.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Have you ever thought about writing web novels?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At that time, I was still not yet fully into pure literature, so I was depressed because I thought the professor's words meant, "You have no talent at all, so get out of the literary world." But now that I look back, that advice meant, "If you keep dying here, your life will be ruined."</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I think of my peers who are having a hard time in the literary world, drinking, I want to give my professor a tip for his wisdom, but unfortunately, I can't even remember his name anymore. It was because I lost many of the memories I had while going through the 'Fear Realm'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"At first, it was hard to adapt to writing web novels."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, it must have been hard if you had come from pure literature. The writing style is very different."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn't know I would struggle that much. But I graduated from the Department of Creative Writing."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's possible. In fact, our industry has a relatively low barrier to entry, right? Anyone can write if they have a keyboard."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It didn't feel real at all that I was talking about web novels with Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. Anyway, I had a hard time at first."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No one is good at writing from the beginning. Although there are geniuses sometimes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You weren't good at writing at first either?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm that genius?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled bitterly as I watched Han Sooyoung smiling proudly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though she said that, I knew that she was the one who worked harder than anyone else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, she was someone who had serialized a novel that only one person read for over 10 years.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Come on, get up. We have to keep going."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sighed and got up from my seat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you going to hit me again?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who said you'd just get hit? I told you to hit me too. Then I'll answer the questions you want?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Easier said than done."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You only need to hit once, is that so hard?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's harder than when I first started reading web novels."</p>
<p class="orv_line">She said one hit, but from my perspective, it seemed like Han Sooyoung was just beating me up under the pretense of training.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is it because you've been studying pure literature? Your skill usage is so old-fashioned."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Honestly, how much pure literature have you read?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Your basic stamina is also really poor."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I've never seen a writer with such good stamina."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"For a writer, stamina that doesn't get tired even after working for three days and nights is a given. In my time—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly used the story.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story fragment, 'Way of the Wind', begins its storytelling!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Way of the Wind, condensed into 'Unbreakable Faith', swirled and created a fierce sword wind. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung muttered as if it was interesting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, this one has good application?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, my [Way of the Wind] didn’t even brush Han Sooyoung’s collar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I bit my lips and swung my sword again and again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung kept asking questions while dodging my strikes here and there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What’s the name of this skill?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s [Way of the Wind], right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That’s the skill name. [Way of the Wind] isn’t used like that originally."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn’t give it a name."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I’m not Killer King, so I wouldn’t have named every skill I used like "Dark Spinning Breaker".</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Han Sooyoung looked at me as if I was pathetic.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Isn’t that skill your original? But you didn’t even give it a name?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why do you have to give it something like that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Because it becomes stronger with a name."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn’t understand what she meant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It becomes stronger with a name?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Extinction Sword (멸화검)."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Han Sooyoung muttered softly, a long purple sword spurted out from above the dagger she was holding.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at the shape of the sword spur and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Extinction Sword? Isn't that just [Black Flame] stretched out and pulled out?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Extinction Sword Form 1, Annihilation." (멸화검 제1식, 멸화개아.)</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung shouted the name of the technique without paying attention to my tackle. Following that, the form of [After Flame] wrapped around Han Sooyoung's entire body like a flower bud, and soon deflected all the blade storms created by [Way of the Wind].</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation, 'Maritime War God's', eyes sparkle!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', is happy to see 'Extinction Sword' for the first time in a long time.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Messages from the Constellations pouring down from the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like I could understand Han Sooyoung's words that I had to give it a name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Form 2, Extinction." (제2식. 멸화분분.)</p>
<p class="orv_line">Following that, a flower bud made of [Black Flame] opened. The sight of a flower made of pure purple energy blooming was captivating just by looking at it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment my gaze was captured by that scenery, the purple energy that had bloomed like petals scattering fragrance began to pour out in all directions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Tch."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hurriedly activated the 'Blade of Faith', but it was not enough to counter the countless energy of [Black Flame]. In an instant, small scars appeared on my arms and legs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was purely astonished by the overwhelming difference in skill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as my skill relied on the source of [Way of the Wind], her skill was also based on [Black Flame]. However, the way she used [Black Flame] was much more sophisticated and delicate than how I used [Way of the Wind].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung shook her head and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's not a difference in skill. It's a difference in imagination."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A difference in imagination.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even if you handle the story in the same way, the image of the technique changes completely depending on how you name it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized belatedly what she meant. It was true that I had only given it a name, but the image of the technique felt much clearer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A crouching flower bud and a blooming petal fluttering in the wind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The established name creates a framework for imagination and stimulates the curiosity of the Constellations.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation, 'Goryeo's Swordsman', feels the longing for the Murim.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then...</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Storm Wave Fortress (풍랑섬)."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swung my sword with all my might. The magical power in my body drained away and the shape of the blade storm created by [Way of the Wind] changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of the wolf that had taught me [Way of the Wind]. The Wolf of Immutar galloping across the plains of Chronos. The wolves running toward the sunset began to roar all at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kudduddud! The energy of [Way of the Wind] and [Black Flame] collided, creating a whirlwind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This side was slightly pushed back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued to supply my magical power and added [Baekcheong-ganggi] to the blade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"White Wave Fortress(백랑섬)."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The manes of the roaring wolves scattered silver. Some wolves were cut to death by the flower petals, but some wolves managed to bite the flower petals. With a sound of sparks, the magical power was canceled in the air, and [Black Flame] and [Way of the Wind] scattered into ash.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung smiled as if she was amazed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You have good learning ability. Is 'Storm Wave' (풍랑) borrowed from Lycaon's name?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I then activated other stories and skills one after another.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story, 'Tenacious Martial Arts Master', begins its storytelling!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A story obtained from Cheon Gae, The Dragon's Head Ark of Beggar Sect.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill, 'Nakgak Breath Lv. 10', is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The long breath sucked in by [Nakgak Breath] strengthened the magic circulation efficiency of 'Circulation Delay'. It was the result of practicing the skill linkage that the Demon King of Salvation had pointed out before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung, who had exchanged a hundred or so combinations with me in an instant, nodded and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The skill set isn't that great, but the linkage isn't bad. You worked hard, didn't you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt elated for no reason.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I worked hard. It felt so good to be recognized for that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It felt like a certain sense that I had long forgotten was awakening again. Even though it was just clashing swords and telling stories that I had accumulated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't get excited for no reason. We still have a long way to go. Is there anything else you know how to do?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I can use Kim Dokja's power."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Currently, I have accepted the 'First Kim Dokja'—the 'Demon King of Salvation'—and the 'Second Kim Dokja'—the 'King of Fear'. I was able to borrow their powers that remained in the [Fourth Wall] with the power of 'Heir of the Eternal Name'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Try it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Not now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't know."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently, a part of the 'Fourth Wall' is being restored.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', refuses your request.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It seems that the [Fourth Wall] is not in good condition. The Heir guy is not listening to me either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung asked, licking her lips.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This is difficult. What else?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I can also use Cheon Inho's techniques."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"[Incite]?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then try that."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Despite Han Sooyoung's suggestion, I hesitated a little this time. Because I experienced Cheon Inho's '40th Round' in the Time Fault of the Fear Realm, my [Incite] had become quite strong. Right now, I was confident that even a mediocre Constellation could kneel with just [Incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You'll get hurt."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung said with a smirk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Want to make a bet? If your [Incite] works even a little, I'll grant you one wish."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wish?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't regret it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth without hesitation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I briefly thought about what [Incite] I should do. Since it's my first time, I'll go with something safe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You're worse at writing than me."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill, Incite Lv.???', is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A spark flew in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung stared at me blankly. Then, I felt a strong backlash in my incarnation body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story, 'One Who Rewrites Fate', offsets your probability aftershock.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, I failed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Would that spell work?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You never know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The basics aren't right. Before using [Incite], you should analyze what kind of emotional state the other person is in."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was about to say that I analyzed a little bit, but stopped myself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If I had even the slightest thought that I might lose to you, would that [Incite] work?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then what should I have said to [Incite] you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You have to find that out. Other than this? Nothing?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Nothing."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.???', is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung's smile deepened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's pretty good. I almost believed it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What a shame."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Actually, Han Sooyoung was right. I still had one more important asset left.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You, do you have a 'Giant Tale'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I do, but I don't know how to use it yet. To be exact, it’s in a state where it can’t be used."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What does that mean?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought about it for a moment and decided to be honest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s not just 'skills' that need a name to be used properly."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You haven’t gotten a name for it yet, have you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"When did you get the Giant Tale?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, it’s been quite some time."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then, the &lt;Star Stream&gt; must have given it to you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung approached me with a puzzled expression and grabbed my wrist. Her story began to rush into me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And as if to oppose her story, a strong energy boiled inside me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Giant Tale' was resisting Han Sooyoung’s story. As if it was rejecting all of her stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Look at this?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung, who had been briefly confronting the story, opened her mouth as if she found it interesting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This guy is refusing to be given a name?"</p>
