<p class="orv_line">I looked into those innocent eyes and let out a sound without realizing it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, he seemed to not recognize me and clung to Asmodeus with a fearful expression.</p>

<p class="orv_line">The book he had been reading just a moment ago fell from the little boy&#x27;s hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I blankly looked down at the title of the book.</p>
<p class="orv_line">『The World After The Fall.』</p>
<p class="orv_line">My head was dizzy. Memories of the times he and I spent together flowed through my mind for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Somehow, I felt like I could understand everything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason I had met &#x27;Jaehwan-ssi&#x27; a while ago, and the reason Jaehwan-ssi&#x27;s colleagues were in this fear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was as if all those events were tied together by a single inevitability.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hyung.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The person who always emphasized fate to me. The one who said that no matter what, the protagonist should be given a chance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the one who declared that this time he would write without using chance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He looked up at me with a face that seemed to have found the real chance this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Giyeon-hyung. Are you my hyung?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though he had become a kkoma Kim Dokja, I could definitely recognize him. Just as I could recognize Gu Seonah or Kim Kyungsik, I could recognize him in the same way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely Giyeon-hyung. The one who wrote 『The World After The Fall』 with me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I took a step closer, Giyeon-hyung took a step back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus, who had gotten up from his seat, spoke as if to stop me.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【That’s enough. Don&#x27;t scare the kids.】</div>【That’s enough. Don't scare the kids.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What on earth did you do? You. Why is Giyeon-hyung here?&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Hmm? His name shouldn&#x27;t be &#x27;Giyeon&#x27;.】</div>【Hmm? His name shouldn't be 'Giyeon'.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Answer the question.&quot;</p>

<p class="orv_line">In an instant, an image appeared on the screen with the sound of tsutsutsutsu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a very old memory.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Hakhyun. Can I keep writing like this?&quot;」</div>「"Hakhyun. Can I keep writing like this?"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Don&#x27;t worry.&quot;」</div>「"Don't worry."」</p>

<p class="orv_line">Everything felt like a lie.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The memories that had been fading away in my head bloomed all at once like flowers blooming in season.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Hyung! See! I told you. I told you it would work!&quot;」</div>「"Hyung! See! I told you. I told you it would work!"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">A story before the scenarios began, even before the existence of 『Omniscient Reader&#x27;s Viewpoint』.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Now I&#x27;ll have something to eat. It&#x27;s all thanks to you, Hakhyun.&quot;」</div>「"Now I'll have something to eat. It's all thanks to you, Hakhyun."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">A time when both Hyung and I were poor. The life of those days when I just liked writing, and that’s why I called myself a writer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stood blankly in the center of the theater and watched the story of those days. And I thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Where on earth does this universe connect from and to?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What else do I have to sacrifice to finish this long story?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What do you want, Asmodeus?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly turned my head and saw Asmodeus’s face smiling.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【It seems like we’re starting to talk now.】</div>【It seems like we’re starting to talk now.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus sat back down on his seat in the theater and took another deep sip of his Zero Cola.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【But I don’t really want anything from you. If I deal with you, you’ll just use another clever trick to get away with it.】</div>【But I don’t really want anything from you. If I deal with you, you’ll just use another clever trick to get away with it.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That depends on what you do.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Do you think this is the first or second time I’ve been treated like that by Kim Dokja?】</div>【Do you think this is the first or second time I’ve been treated like that by Kim Dokja?】</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the main story, Asmodeus was hit in the back of the head by Kim Dokja several times. And even the ending wasn’t so good. He called himself the &#x27;Searcher of the End&#x27; and planned something meaningful, but he met a vain end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stopped thinking about that. Now that I think about it.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「What on earth was Asmodeus&#x27;s ■■?」</div>「What on earth was Asmodeus's ■■?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Everyone in the &lt;Star Stream&gt; has their own ■■.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That must have been the same for Asmodeus. What kind of end did he dream of?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know for sure, but what&#x27;s certain is that he hasn&#x27;t yet reached the ■■ he dreamed of.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you also want the interpretation of the natural Disaster-level Fear that I got?&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Of course, that&#x27;s a very interesting interpretation. Especially the stories that were laid out in advance to make that interpretation possible.】</div>【Of course, that's a very interesting interpretation. Especially the stories that were laid out in advance to make that interpretation possible.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story that he mentioned while giggling was &#x27;Heir of the Eternal Name&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus knows how that story was created, and who it sacrificed to be born.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;d better be careful of what you say. If you don&#x27;t want the movie theater to be destroyed again.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【If you do something so rude, the kkoma Kim Dokja next to me won&#x27;t be safe either.】</div>【If you do something so rude, the kkoma Kim Dokja next to me won't be safe either.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you going to threaten me with Giyeon hyung?&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【What can&#x27;t a little kidnapper do?】</div>【What can't a little kidnapper do?】</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glared at him quietly and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well. You wouldn&#x27;t do something like that.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Why do you think so?】</div>【Why do you think so?】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because you don&#x27;t look like that kind of villain.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly looked back at the kkoma Kim Dokjas&#x27; faces. They must have been locked in this theater for quite some time already, but for some reason their expressions didn&#x27;t look that dark.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It didn&#x27;t seem to be simply because of the snack display case on one side of the theater or the sleeping bags lined up on one side of the seats. I can&#x27;t quite understand it, but what can I say?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「These kkoma Kim Dokjas seemed to be following Asmodeus.」</div>「These kkoma Kim Dokjas seemed to be following Asmodeus.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some of the kkoma Kim Dokjas were even standing next to Asmodeus and glaring at me as if they were reprimanding me. I waved my hand lightly at them and asked Asmodeus.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What on earth is your purpose?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I began to think that it was time to have a proper conversation with this guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter what had happened and how things had gone wrong, both he and I had already come this far. I couldn&#x27;t deny that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you&#x27;re a &#x27;Recorder of Fear,&#x27; you must have an &#x27;ultimate sentence&#x27; that you want to write. Why on earth did you come up with something like this?&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Wow, where did you hear such interesting information?】</div>【Wow, where did you hear such interesting information?】</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I watched the guy babbling, I recalled the moment when I first met him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The day I was first summoned to his theater, he had been surprised to see me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, at that time, he didn&#x27;t really know who I was.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;This is... No way? You are...&quot;」</div>「"This is... No way? You are..."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">After he found out who I was, he began to plot some kind of evil scheme, making me the &#x27;main character&#x27; of this world line.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;It&#x27;s time to write a new 『Omniscient Reader&#x27;s Viewpoint』 with your own hands.&quot;」</div>「"It's time to write a new 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』 with your own hands."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a plan to use me to change the story of the 41st round to my liking and ruin &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If even a guy like you can become a &#x27;Recorder of Fear&#x27;, then this &lt;Star Stream&gt; is really generous.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【...】</div>【...】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You know? Your plans have all been a mess. They&#x27;re inconsistent and never really succeeded.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Say what you want. My goal has already been achieved to some extent. Because those I hate have suffered hellish pain.】</div>【Say what you want. My goal has already been achieved to some extent. Because those I hate have suffered hellish pain.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Your goal isn&#x27;t just to make &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; despair.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The day I first met him at the theater, my readers and I received a sub-scenario from &#x27;Asmodeus&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I opened the old log page, the scenario I received back then was printed out once again.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Sub-scenario (???) — Qualification of Record&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Sub (Individual)</p>
<p>Difficulty: ???</p>
<p>Clear Conditions: You are possessed in this worldline through the &#x27;Covenant of the Other World&#x27;. Cooperate with other possessors to prevent the imminent destruction and open up a new tale.</p>
<p>Time Limit: —</p>
<p>Reward: Return to the original worldline and receive additional rewards.</p>
<p>Failure: Death</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe when I first received this scenario, I should have noticed that he was the &#x27;Recorder of Fear&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You want something at the end of this worldline. That&#x27;s why you gave me and the readers this scenario.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【…】</div>【…】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is this scenario something that you agreed on with the other recorders?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus&#x27;s lips trembled slightly at my question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued to ask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How many Recorders of Fear are there who act as &#x27;RepresentativeKimDokja&#x27;? How many fragments of Kim Dokja have you kidnapped in this way?&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【It&#x27;s amazing that I&#x27;m still surprised by you. How did you find out about that?】</div>【It's amazing that I'm still surprised by you. How did you find out about that?】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s strange if I still don&#x27;t know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this world line, in the 41st round, a lot of strange things happened. And those &#x27;strange things&#x27; started from the incident where &#x27;a large number of readers possessed characters&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s clear that the &#x27;Recorders of Fear&#x27; were behind that situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it weren&#x27;t for these guys who freely cross world lines and interfere with the story, such a large-scale treasonous act would not have been committed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Stop kidnapping  the kkoma Kim Dokjas. You&#x27;ve done enough nonsense. Now let&#x27;s slowly send the readers back to their original places.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【No.】</div>【No.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Fine. Let&#x27;s make a deal, Asmodeus.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【I said no.】</div>【I said no.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You haven&#x27;t even heard the terms of the deal yet?&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【No, I don&#x27;t make deals with Kim Dokjas—】</div>【No, I don't make deals with Kim Dokjas—】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ll help you write the &#x27;one sentence&#x27; you want.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A short silence flowed. Maybe it was because of his mood, but Asmodeus&#x27;s mood had become a little sharp.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The air in the theater had settled down quietly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus asked.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【How do you know what the &#x27;one sentence&#x27; I want to write is?】</div>【How do you know what the 'one sentence' I want to write is?】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared into Asmodeus&#x27;s eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see things that I hadn&#x27;t seen when I first met him.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story, &#x27;Heir of the Eternal Name&#x27;, smiles triumphantly.]</div>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', smiles triumphantly.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">Maybe it&#x27;s because my understanding of the &#x27;Recorders of Fear&#x27; has increased.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Of course, he&#x27;s still stronger than me. Of course, he&#x27;s a Demon King, and a &#x27;Recorder of Fear&#x27; with the power of an outer god.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You don&#x27;t seem &#x27;terrible&#x27; to me anymore.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wasn&#x27;t scared of him anymore.</p>

<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Good. Okay, I&#x27;ll hold out for today.&quot;」</div>「"Good. Okay, I'll hold out for today."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy&#x27;s records began to float before my eyes in real time. From the moment Kim Dokja and Asmodeus first met, until the guy who had been wandering the dark dimension died.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Wait.】</div>【Wait.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that distant history, I understood Asmodeus.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy&#x27;s eyes were trembling as he looked at me. The guy who became a &#x27;Recorder of Fear&#x27; knew. That I was reading him right now.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Stop.】</div>【Stop.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">That all of his history was intertwined with me, one by one.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【I told you to stop, Kim Dokja!】</div>【I told you to stop, Kim Dokja!】</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus, who had finally grabbed Giyeon-hyung by the collar, growled at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I released [Omniscient Reader&#x27;s Viewpoint] and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you have any intention of making a deal now?&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Fuck. Do you know? You are the one who is more suitable to be a Demon King than anyone else.】</div>【Fuck. Do you know? You are the one who is more suitable to be a Demon King than anyone else.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s right. You are the Demon King in reality.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A brightly lit theater.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Our shadows stretched out and fell on the white screen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We looked at each other&#x27;s shadows for a moment. Two beings with different wants and different ways of living.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Okay. Let&#x27;s make a deal.】</div>【Okay. Let's make a deal.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, both shadows looked like Demon Kings.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After a while, we made a contract through the &#x27;Existence Oath&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【What you want is the &#x27;Kim Dokja Fragments&#x27; that I have, right?】</div>【What you want is the 'Kim Dokja Fragments' that I have, right?】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s right.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Then let&#x27;s start the first deal lightly.】</div>【Then let's start the first deal lightly.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy said. He said he couldn&#x27;t give me all the &#x27;Kim Dokja Fragments&#x27; that he had. However,</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【The only thing I can give you right now is this guy. Take him.】</div>【The only thing I can give you right now is this guy. Take him.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">A kkoma Kim Dokja who suddenly rose up sat on my shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first, the little boy kept turning around as if he was uncomfortable, but soon he settled down and placed his chin on the book he was reading on my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Giyeon-hyung.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no response when I spoke to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sometimes he would tremble as if he was reading a certain passage, and sometimes he would laugh quietly as if he was having fun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If possible, I wanted to protect him by putting him in the [Fourth Wall], but for some reason, he refused. Maybe he had a scene he wanted to see while staying next to me.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【My terms of trade are simple.】</div>【My terms of trade are simple.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Tell me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be honest, I was nervous that he would suggest ridiculous terms, but surprisingly, Asmodeus&#x27;s terms were not bad.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【When the &#x27;King of Fear&#x27; appears in front of you, you must call me.】</div>【When the 'King of Fear' appears in front of you, you must call me.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Okay. If that&#x27;s all.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to the interpretation of the prophecy, the &#x27;King of Fear&#x27; he was talking about meant &#x27;Second Kim Dokja.&#x27; It was obvious that he would show up and do strange things, but if it was just that, it wasn&#x27;t a bad condition.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus curled his lips as if he had read my thoughts.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【I don’t know if you’ll be able to survive until then.】</div>【I don’t know if you’ll be able to survive until then.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Don’t you know that if I hear something like that, I’ll definitely survive?”</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Well. This time, it won’t be easy even for you. There’s something you absolutely must overcome in order to meet the &#x27;King of Fear&#x27;.】</div>【Well. This time, it won’t be easy even for you. There’s something you absolutely must overcome in order to meet the 'King of Fear'.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who is that?&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Who would that be?】</div>【Who would that be?】</p>
<p class="orv_line">When did it start? The scenery in the movie theater was gradually becoming blurry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly realized something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ah, I see.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Recorder of Fear &#x27;Demon King of the Cinema&#x27;s turn will soon end.]</div>[The Recorder of Fear 'Demon King of the Cinema's turn will soon end.]</p>
