            <div class="orv_title"><h1>836 Episode 43 Transcendent Alliance (5)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked into those innocent eyes and let out a sound without realizing it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, he seemed to not recognize me and clung to Asmodeus with a fearful expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then Asmodeus smiled.</p>
【It&#39;s okay. Look. Isn&#39;t this someone you know well?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The book he had been reading just a moment ago fell from the little boy&#39;s hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I blankly looked down at the title of the book.</p>
<p class="orv_line">『The World After The Fall.』</p>
<p class="orv_line">My head was dizzy. Memories of the times he and I spent together flowed through my mind for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Somehow, I felt like I could understand everything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason I had met &#39;Jaehwan-ssi&#39; a while ago, and the reason Jaehwan-ssi&#39;s colleagues were in this fear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was as if all those events were tied together by a single inevitability.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hyung.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The person who always emphasized fate to me. The one who said that no matter what, the protagonist should be given a chance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the one who declared that this time he would write without using chance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He looked up at me with a face that seemed to have found the real chance this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Giyeon-hyung. Are you my hyung?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though he had become a kkoma Kim Dokja, I could definitely recognize him. Just as I could recognize Gu Seonah or Kim Kyungsik, I could recognize him in the same way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely Giyeon-hyung. The one who wrote 『The World After The Fall』 with me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I took a step closer, Giyeon-hyung took a step back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus, who had gotten up from his seat, spoke as if to stop me.</p>
【That’s enough. Don&#39;t scare the kids.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What on earth did you do? You. Why is Giyeon-hyung here?&quot;</p>
【Hmm? His name shouldn&#39;t be &#39;Giyeon&#39;.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Answer the question.&quot;</p>
【I just brought a piece of the unlucky dead body. However, interestingly, the fragment had memories of you.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In an instant, an image appeared on the screen with the sound of tsutsutsutsu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a very old memory.</p>
「&quot;Hakhyun. Can I keep writing like this?&quot;」</p></div>
「&quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A voice in a hazy memory.</p>
「&quot;No, Hakhyun. Look. The views have dropped.&quot;」</p></div>
「&quot;Hyung, I told you not to be too excited or sad.&quot;」</p></div>
「&quot;Can I really not put in a coincidence? Should I just close my eyes and let him have a coincidence once?&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Everything felt like a lie.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The memories that had been fading away in my head bloomed all at once like flowers blooming in season.</p>
「&quot;Hyung! See! I told you. I told you it would work!&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A story before the scenarios began, even before the existence of 『Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint』.</p>
「&quot;Now I&#39;ll have something to eat. It&#39;s all thanks to you, Hakhyun.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A time when both Hyung and I were poor. The life of those days when I just liked writing, and that’s why I called myself a writer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stood blankly in the center of the theater and watched the story of those days. And I thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Where on earth does this universe connect from and to?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What else do I have to sacrifice to finish this long story?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What do you want, Asmodeus?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly turned my head and saw Asmodeus’s face smiling.</p>
【It seems like we’re starting to talk now.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus sat back down on his seat in the theater and took another deep sip of his Zero Cola.</p>
【But I don’t really want anything from you. If I deal with you, you’ll just use another clever trick to get away with it.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That depends on what you do.&quot;</p>
【Do you think this is the first or second time I’ve been treated like that by Kim Dokja?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the main story, Asmodeus was hit in the back of the head by Kim Dokja several times. And even the ending wasn’t so good. He called himself the &#39;Searcher of the End&#39; and planned something meaningful, but he met a vain end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stopped thinking about that. Now that I think about it.</p>
「What on earth was Asmodeus&#39;s ■■?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Everyone in the &lt;Star Stream&gt; has their own ■■.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That must have been the same for Asmodeus. What kind of end did he dream of?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know for sure, but what&#39;s certain is that he hasn&#39;t yet reached the ■■ he dreamed of.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you also want the interpretation of the natural Disaster-level Fear that I got?&quot;</p>
【Of course, that&#39;s a very interesting interpretation. Especially the stories that were laid out in advance to make that interpretation possible.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The story that he mentioned while giggling was &#39;Heir of the Eternal Name&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus knows how that story was created, and who it sacrificed to be born.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;d better be careful of what you say. If you don&#39;t want the movie theater to be destroyed again.&quot;</p>
【If you do something so rude, the kkoma Kim Dokja next to me won&#39;t be safe either.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you going to threaten me with Giyeon hyung?&quot;</p>
【What can&#39;t a little kidnapper do?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I glared at him quietly and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well. You wouldn&#39;t do something like that.&quot;</p>
【Why do you think so?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because you don&#39;t look like that kind of villain.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly looked back at the kkoma Kim Dokjas&#39; faces. They must have been locked in this theater for quite some time already, but for some reason their expressions didn&#39;t look that dark.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It didn&#39;t seem to be simply because of the snack display case on one side of the theater or the sleeping bags lined up on one side of the seats. I can&#39;t quite understand it, but what can I say?</p>
「These kkoma Kim Dokjas seemed to be following Asmodeus.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Some of the kkoma Kim Dokjas were even standing next to Asmodeus and glaring at me as if they were reprimanding me. I waved my hand lightly at them and asked Asmodeus.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What on earth is your purpose?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I began to think that it was time to have a proper conversation with this guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter what had happened and how things had gone wrong, both he and I had already come this far. I couldn&#39;t deny that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you&#39;re a &#39;Recorder of Fear,&#39; you must have an &#39;ultimate sentence&#39; that you want to write. Why on earth did you come up with something like this?&quot;</p>
【Wow, where did you hear such interesting information?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As I watched the guy babbling, I recalled the moment when I first met him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The day I was first summoned to his theater, he had been surprised to see me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, at that time, he didn&#39;t really know who I was.</p>
「&quot;This is... No way? You are...&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After he found out who I was, he began to plot some kind of evil scheme, making me the &#39;main character&#39; of this world line.</p>
「&quot;It&#39;s time to write a new 『Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint』 with your own hands.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a plan to use me to change the story of the 41st round to my liking and ruin &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If even a guy like you can become a &#39;Recorder of Fear&#39;, then this &lt;Star Stream&gt; is really generous.&quot;</p>
【...】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You know? Your plans have all been a mess. They&#39;re inconsistent and never really succeeded.&quot;</p>
【Say what you want. My goal has already been achieved to some extent. Because those I hate have suffered hellish pain.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Your goal isn&#39;t just to make &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; despair.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The day I first met him at the theater, my readers and I received a sub-scenario from &#39;Asmodeus&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I opened the old log page, the scenario I received back then was printed out once again.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Sub-scenario (???) — Qualification of Record&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Sub (Individual)</p>
<p>Difficulty: ???</p>
<p>Clear Conditions: You are possessed in this worldline through the &#39;Covenant of the Other World&#39;. Cooperate with other possessors to prevent the imminent destruction and open up a new tale.</p>
<p>Time Limit: —</p>
<p>Reward: Return to the original worldline and receive additional rewards.</p>
<p>Failure: Death</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe when I first received this scenario, I should have noticed that he was the &#39;Recorder of Fear&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You want something at the end of this worldline. That&#39;s why you gave me and the readers this scenario.&quot;</p>
【…】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is this scenario something that you agreed on with the other recorders?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus&#39;s lips trembled slightly at my question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued to ask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How many Recorders of Fear are there who act as &#39;RepresentativeKimDokja&#39;? How many fragments of Kim Dokja have you kidnapped in this way?&quot;</p>
【It&#39;s amazing that I&#39;m still surprised by you. How did you find out about that?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s strange if I still don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this world line, in the 41st round, a lot of strange things happened. And those &#39;strange things&#39; started from the incident where &#39;a large number of readers possessed characters&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s clear that the &#39;Recorders of Fear&#39; were behind that situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it weren&#39;t for these guys who freely cross world lines and interfere with the story, such a large-scale treasonous act would not have been committed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Stop kidnapping  the kkoma Kim Dokjas. You&#39;ve done enough nonsense. Now let&#39;s slowly send the readers back to their original places.&quot;</p>
【No.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Fine. Let&#39;s make a deal, Asmodeus.&quot;</p>
【I said no.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You haven&#39;t even heard the terms of the deal yet?&quot;</p>
【No, I don&#39;t make deals with Kim Dokjas—】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;ll help you write the &#39;one sentence&#39; you want.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A short silence flowed. Maybe it was because of his mood, but Asmodeus&#39;s mood had become a little sharp.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The air in the theater had settled down quietly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus asked.</p>
【How do you know what the &#39;one sentence&#39; I want to write is?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared into Asmodeus&#39;s eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see things that I hadn&#39;t seen when I first met him.</p>
[The story, &#39;Heir of the Eternal Name&#39;, smiles triumphantly.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it&#39;s because my rank has increased.</p>
[Exclusive trait, &#39;Record Repairer&#39;, activates!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it&#39;s because my understanding of the &#39;Recorders of Fear&#39; has increased.</p>
[Recorder of Fear, &#39;Demon King of the Cinema&#39;, expresses his displeasure at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, he&#39;s still stronger than me. Of course, he&#39;s a Demon King, and a &#39;Recorder of Fear&#39; with the power of an outer god.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You don&#39;t seem &#39;terrible&#39; to me anymore.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wasn&#39;t scared of him anymore.</p>
[Exclusive skill, &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint&#39;, is activated!]</p></div>
[Your understanding of the target is very high!]</p></div>
「&quot;...Ah, call me again.&quot;」</p></div>
「&quot;Don&#39;t be so cautious. There are no other constellations.&quot;」</p></div>
「&quot;Demon King of Salvation... You seem to be mistaken about something right now, but I will—&quot;」</p></div>
「&quot;Good. Okay, I&#39;ll hold out for today.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The guy&#39;s records began to float before my eyes in real time. From the moment Kim Dokja and Asmodeus first met, until the guy who had been wandering the dark dimension died.</p>
【Wait.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In that distant history, I understood Asmodeus.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy&#39;s eyes were trembling as he looked at me. The guy who became a &#39;Recorder of Fear&#39; knew. That I was reading him right now.</p>
【Stop.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That all of his history was intertwined with me, one by one.</p>
【I told you to stop, Kim Dokja!】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus, who had finally grabbed Giyeon-hyung by the collar, growled at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I released [Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint] and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you have any intention of making a deal now?&quot;</p>
【Fuck. Do you know? You are the one who is more suitable to be a Demon King than anyone else.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s right. You are the Demon King in reality.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A brightly lit theater.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Our shadows stretched out and fell on the white screen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We looked at each other&#39;s shadows for a moment. Two beings with different wants and different ways of living.</p>
【Okay. Let&#39;s make a deal.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, both shadows looked like Demon Kings.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After a while, we made a contract through the &#39;Existence Oath&#39;.</p>
【What you want is the &#39;Kim Dokja Fragments&#39; that I have, right?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;</p>
【Then let&#39;s start the first deal lightly.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The guy said. He said he couldn&#39;t give me all the &#39;Kim Dokja Fragments&#39; that he had. However,</p>
【The only thing I can give you right now is this guy. Take him.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A kkoma Kim Dokja who suddenly rose up sat on my shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first, the little boy kept turning around as if he was uncomfortable, but soon he settled down and placed his chin on the book he was reading on my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Giyeon-hyung.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no response when I spoke to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sometimes he would tremble as if he was reading a certain passage, and sometimes he would laugh quietly as if he was having fun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If possible, I wanted to protect him by putting him in the [Fourth Wall], but for some reason, he refused. Maybe he had a scene he wanted to see while staying next to me.</p>
【My terms of trade are simple.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Tell me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be honest, I was nervous that he would suggest ridiculous terms, but surprisingly, Asmodeus&#39;s terms were not bad.</p>
【When the &#39;King of Fear&#39; appears in front of you, you must call me.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Okay. If that&#39;s all.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to the interpretation of the prophecy, the &#39;King of Fear&#39; he was talking about meant &#39;Second Kim Dokja.&#39; It was obvious that he would show up and do strange things, but if it was just that, it wasn&#39;t a bad condition.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus curled his lips as if he had read my thoughts.</p>
【I don’t know if you’ll be able to survive until then.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">“Don’t you know that if I hear something like that, I’ll definitely survive?”</p>
【Well. This time, it won’t be easy even for you. There’s something you absolutely must overcome in order to meet the &#39;King of Fear&#39;.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who is that?&quot;</p>
【Who would that be?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When did it start? The scenery in the movie theater was gradually becoming blurry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly realized something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ah, I see.</p>
[The Recorder of Fear &#39;Demon King of the Cinema&#39;s turn will soon end.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus’s laughter was heard.</p>
【Wake up, Kim Dokja. If you don’t want him to take away all the &#39;history&#39; you’ve built.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was finally time to meet Cheon Inho from the 40th round.</p>
[You entered the room of the Recorder of Fear &#39;Evil Sophist&#39;.]</p></div>
