<p class="orv_line">rlaehrwk37: But isn’t he passing out too often?</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">When I opened my eyes again, it was night. In the faint hunger and thirst, I blinked my eyes, then raised my upper body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How many times have I fainted?</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this point, it was not the time to tease Kim Dokja by calling him a 'fainting man'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't get to meet Kim Dokja this time. Usually, whenever I passed out, I met him in the snowfield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An old table and countertop were visible in the dim darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered what kind of kitchen it was, but it seemed to be inside a nearby restaurant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Woke up?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the darkness, Jung Heewon's face appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who had her hair done with pride, was sharpening her knife under the moonlight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While I was feeling something eerie, I held out the temperance pot that Jung Heewon had placed next to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Would you like to eat this?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Inside the pot were several grains of gourd crops and roasted foreleg.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m not good at cooking, so I only seasoned it. There was some seasoning left in the restaurant."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, thank you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, I haven't eaten anything all day.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I ate food rich in seasoning after a long time, the taste buds on the tip of my tongue went cold.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a melting feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the hunger and thirst subsided, I thought that I would live a little longer, and I was on the verge of fainting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The situation came to mind spontaneously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was having a conversation with Yoo Jonghyuk. Jung Heewon was away for a while to catch the sniper.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk asked me who Kim Dokja was, and I thought about it… and passed out?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon held out water to me as I choked on food.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking back, I couldn't understand the last situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did I faint while thinking about Kim Dokja?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wait, other than that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Where is Yoo Jonghyuk?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He went alone."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon answered, changing her words indifferently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Leaving us?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon only nodded. But why do you keep being like that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a thud, Jung Heewon put down the clean knife.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had a feeling that something wasn't right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I think she’s going to get mad.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I thought I told you not to die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A strangely sparkly voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you know how surprised I was?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon glared at me with her eyes narrowed. I hurriedly narrowed my eyes and apologized.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I-I'm sorry. But I don't know why that happened either. I passed out all of a sudden."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Really?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, really."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It can't be. Were you threatened by that man?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Weren’t you beaten or mistreated? Take off your shirt."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm not, really."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I answered while sneaking away from Jung Heewon, who reached out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn't really do anything. I just passed out while talking. I guess I'm a bit tired."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon blinked in disbelief and sighed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"My God. It was real."</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I saw the expression on her face, there was a situation that was drawn in my head belatedly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No way?</p>
<p class="orv_line">She dismissed the sniper at the request of Yoo Jonghyuk. The situation where we were away, but I was lying on the spot when she returned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you fight?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We were about to fight."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon pursed her lips and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But he said he felt a bit unfair. He said he didn't do anything, but Inho-ssi collapsed by himself."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"So what?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Of course I didn't believe it. Does that make sense?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It makes no sense.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I almost got into trouble."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I was almost on the verge of drawing a knife, but the words of Dansu-ahjussi came to mind."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu-ahjussi?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Before we broke up, the man said that, if I go out with that man, there will be a situation where I will get angry all of a sudden, and then go to sleep."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I really appreciate Dansu-ahjussi’s wise judgment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He said there could be a misunderstanding."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in the past, the Dansu-ahjussi was misunderstood alone when everyone thought of Yoo Jonghyuk badly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He said it might be.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi’s wisdom is really amazing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The misunderstanding is correct. I really fell alone."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then I'm glad."</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, Yoo Jonghyuk and Kim Dokja became a company at most, but he went away like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Where did Yoo Jonghyuk go?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"To the north."</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it's in the north, he must have gone to rescue his younger sister, Yoo Mia.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because right now is the right time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you have anything else to say?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He said he wouldn’t go out with you anymore."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He doesn’t need a weak guy who faints all the time…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was embarrassing, but it was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The current Inho-ssi cannot properly play the role of Cheon Inho, and he told me to tell you that."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk said, if I could play the role of Cheon Inho, he would believe that I am Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, it means that I am now disqualified.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, to miss Yoo Jonghyuk at such an important moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My mind was complicated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Soon, the battle for the flag will be over, and the 'King's Road' scenario will begin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, going to the 'absolute throne' will be in an instant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But Inho-ssi, why do you want to hang out with him?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked as if she did not understand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You haven't forgotten what kind of person he is, right? Me and Inho-ssi, we were in danger because of him."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hearing that, I remembered that I hadn't explained anything to Jung Heewon until now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon could not understand this situation, because that Yoo Jonghyuk was a human who threw me and Jung Heewon as food for sea  monsters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is there a reason you have to be with that person all this time?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, it was Yoo Jonghyuk who held the key to this world. He is a regressor of the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The strongest incarnation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, that Yoo Jonghyuk eventually met a tragic ruin at the end of the 41st turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order to prevent that ending, I had no choice but to correct his risky behaviors one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon opened her mouth after a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She said, "I heard that Inho-ssi is also an apostle. Is it a problem related to that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I involuntarily stopped breathing. When I raised my head, I saw Jung Heewon with a dark complexion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How long did Jung Heewon ponder over it before asking that question?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You're right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A feeling of late guilt came over me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Yoo Jonghyuk said, if I was 'Cheon Inho' now, it was Jung Heewon in front of me who protected me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could not have survived at Geumho Station and Chungmuro Station without her help.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And to her, I left out important explanations.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Throughout the scenario, Jung Heewon would have been confused.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">For her, who was an ordinary person, the cataclysm of her world, the scenarios and the constellations as well. It must have been a difficult story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But in the meantime, the apostles who knew her future appeared, and even those apostles were her own companions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sorry. I haven't told you anything for too long. Where did you hear that I'm an apostle?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Just all over the place. I heard people talking."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if she pretended not to hear or not see, it seemed that she was actually listening. Even so, Jung Heewon waited for me to speak all along.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you know the 'future' of this world, too?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now is the time to talk to Jung Heewon. Just like Kim Dokja did in the main story, I also have to break through this head-on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly got up from my seat and bowed my head to Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sorry for hiding it for so long. I won't make excuses. I know the future of this world, and I knew of Heewon-ssi's existence from before."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Embarrassed by my sudden apology, Jung Heewon stood up from her seat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"To prevent the destruction of this world, Heewon's help was absolutely necessary. Actually, that's why I tried to become friends with Heewon-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since Jung Heewon had come this far, I couldn't hide it any longer. Because that’d be deceiving her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"So you were trying to be friendly with me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">She shuddered and thought there was nothing she could do. But some relationships can't go forward unless they're particularly weak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I bit my lip and quietly lifted my head. Of course, I thought Jung Heewon would have a disappointed face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Rather, she had a puzzled expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But... I didn't really feel that way. I was the one who went and talked to you first when I was alone, wasn't it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pondered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That… I guess I was lucky."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If I hadn’t been Jung Heewon, wouldn’t we have become close?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Jung Heewon wasn't Jung Heewon, would I have been close to her?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No. I think we wouldn’t."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The person I liked was Jung Heewon, and the person I needed was also Jung Heewon. She may be angry, but it was a meaningless assumption to me in the first place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"As expected, Inho-ssi is honest."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sorry."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What do you have to be sorry about? Thank god, because I am Jung Heewon."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Because I am Jung Heewon, Inho-ssi risked his life for me. It was the same on the bridge and the Theater Dungeon back then. If Inho-ssi wasn’t there, I would have died that day."</p>
<p class="orv_line">How is this person…</p>
<p class="orv_line">A sentence came to mind with a momentary sense of tingling.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「That I was able to come this far thanks to her.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I unknowingly bit my lip. Why does that sentence come to mind now?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Thank you for finding me. I'm not being sarcastic, I mean it."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">How can this person be so consistent even though the speaker is different?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm going crazy too. I am alive here thanks to Heewon."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even knowing that the sentences in my memory do not explain the Jung Heewon in front of me, it was hard to hide my excitement.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon said with a smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Actually, I didn't want to ask until the end. I wanted you to tell me someday. But, on the roof of the Theater Dungeon, I had a rather strange experience. From then on, I was a bit confused."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The roof of the Theater Dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I belatedly remembered what  had happened with Han Sooyoung.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>["This world, that, no…"]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There, Han Sooyoung showed Jung Heewon the story of Omniscient Reader’s</p>
<p class="orv_line">Viewpoint.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What was the story about?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">How else am I supposed to explain that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's a story from a different world than this one."</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much I thought about it, it was best to return Jung Heewon's answer as it was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then all the stories she told me really happened."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, that's right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a moment about the story of that world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The world where Kim Dokja and <Kim Dokja Company> existed. A world where Jung Heewon became the judge of destruction and Cheon Inho died at her hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"In that world, Inho-ssi was a complete badass."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In Jung Heewon's hand was a well-forged Mikazuki Munechika.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of Cheon Inho, who was killed by her sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho, the villain of 'Geumho Station' who instigated, killed, and extorted coins at will.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint. Even though it was Han Sooyoung who first wrote it, I certainly wrote a sentence about it with sincerity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I fiercely wrote sentences that harass, kill, and torment people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because it's villainous, because it's more violent, brutal, and probable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If so, this moment may be the moment when I get back the 'probability' I used at that time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is the Inho-ssi in front of me the same person as Inho-ssi over there?"</p>
