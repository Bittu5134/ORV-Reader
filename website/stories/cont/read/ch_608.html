<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I got a new colleague.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Lee Seyeon' has entered your team.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">ID: Literature Girl 64.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King's younger sister, the fighting genius.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A temporary alliance was established to save Killer King.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The starter has been recruited into the team.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[An additional 500 coins are acquired.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After assessing the current situation as calmly as possible, I opened my mouth.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"The [gargoyle] status ailment will last for four hours inside the stage. Time flows faster outside, so we have to move with the idea of finishing the dungeon in at least two hours."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, there was a possibility that a miracle would happen and Killer King could hunt a 6th-class land dragon or escape on his own, but such a possibility was ruled out.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Realistically, the surest way to save Killer King is to clear the dungeon in the shortest amount of time and end the screening of the movie.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Literature Girl 64 asked.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Is Yoo Joonghyuk upstairs?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Maybe."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I wonder if Yoo Joonghyuk could clear the dungeon."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like I sensed something in Literature Girl’s way of talking about it.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Is there a problem?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Literature Girl 64 seemed to think for a moment about what the problem was.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">She could just ask, but at times like this, the way the siblings acted was similar.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Cleared the stage with adjusted difficulty!]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You get 3,000 coins as an additional reward!]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Additional dice obtained!]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Additional dice obtained!]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps it was because we had cleared a fairly difficult movie, and we received up to 3,000 coins for five reward dice.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll roll the dice first."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As I watched the dice spinning in the air, I thought of Kyung Sein and Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">How far have these two come?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Are they hurt?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Is Lee Jihye playing her role?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Just as Literature Girl 64 believes in Killer King, I wish I had strong faith. I want to believe that they will be safe.</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[The eye of the die is 5.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Go up the stairs 5 steps.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You’ve reached the 3rd floor!]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The eye of the die is 5.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Go up the stairs 5 steps.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The value of the rolling dice was not bad.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">We covered 24 steps in an instant.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">And.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have entered the reward room on the 5th floor.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, the reward room.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I was about to step out, Literature Girl 64 stopped me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The reason was immediately clear.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A decapitated corpse was visible beneath a cabinet lined with reward items.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The hairs on my forearm stood out.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Literature Girl 64 looked around and said.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I don’t think there is anyone else."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">We slowly approached and checked the body. A few steps away from the corpse's body, the man's head was rolling.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I said, suppressing the reflexive feeling of vomiting.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">“This is the member of the Misreading Association. He was the one who claimed to be a writer."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The sharp cut on his neck was terrifying. Even so, he was a guy who had good luck, but he was killed in an instant.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If he's dead here, it must mean that someone has already gone upstairs.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">There was no time.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Get the reward first."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">We each scattered and checked the items we wanted to collect as rewards.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Reward items are limited to 2 per person.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I chose a sword and combat uniform for her to use instead of Jung Heewon.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Mikazuki Munechika – Replica: Class A sword.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The first thing I chose was the sword she used in the main story. In addition, I picked out a combat uniform that seemed useful to her.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Impossible Mission – Replica: Class A Armor.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If this is enough, I won't have to worry about Jung Heewon's equipment for the time being. By the way, seeing that she still hadn't woken up, the aftereffects of [Incite] seemed to last quite a while.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I'll have to be careful when using it in the future.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After choosing Jung Heewon's equipment, I looked at the equipment I could use.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I had two pieces of equipment I could take with me, but one wasn't mine. It was because I had to keep his promise with the 7th apostle Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Let's see.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder if I looked around for about 30 seconds like that. I found the item in question.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Shingijeon Replica: A-class artillery.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Wow, this is real.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>Description: A speaker (X) made in the Joseon Dynasty, a kind of multi-launch rocket weapon.</p>
<p>It can fire 15 shots at a time, up to 100 shots in a row.</p>
<p>The passive skill [Heavy Firepower] is built-in, greatly amplifying the ranged artillery fire ability of allies within 10 square meters when used.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Just looking at the description, I can understand why Ye Hyunwoo wanted this item. If you link the turrets led by Gong Pildu, there will definitely be tremendous synergies.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Shingijeon Replica' is selected.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This item has a built-in 'reduced transformation' function.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I was wondering how to take this, but fortunately it was an item that could be reduced and transformed.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I chose the new item and put it in my pocket.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">And besides that, I looked for useful items while going around the whole room.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Like the replica version of “Molnir” that Lee Gilyoung used in the main story, or “Hercules' Shield.”</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Thought of Almost Anything, who had turned into slime, was excited to see the items lined up.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was clinging to all over the place.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The mimicry skill of [Thoughts of Almost Everything] increases!</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[It learnt a new mimicry form!]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[It learnt a new mimicry form!]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps it was because its proficiency had risen, but now the conditions for collecting the shape of A-class or lower items were not so difficult.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">About 5 minutes after that, I collected most of the weapon shapes in the [Room of Reward].</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[‘Thoughts of Almost Everything’ are satisfied with form prey.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Although there were no imitations of S-class or higher, if I collected this much, there would not be a shortage of weapons for a while. I finally chose one protective gear.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Weapons can be summoned at any time using 'thought', but since protective gear must be worn at the same time, it was impossible to rely on the [Mimicry] function alone.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[External Reinforced Suit - Replica: A-class armor.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">And Kim Dokja also chose this suit.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In the current situation, I thought it wouldn't be bad to choose this.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Looking around, Literature Girl 64 must have had the same thoughts, and she had chosen the female version of the 'exterior strengthening suit'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After we got ready, we stood in the aisle again going upstairs.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This is the end of the trip together with Departure Cinema Travel.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There is no movement bonus for 'latecomers' from that floor onwards.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are the first to complete the 'Departure Cinema Trip' scenario.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You will receive 2,000 coins as a reward.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Now, it is no longer possible to skip the number of floors using the dice trick.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Instead, there was an advantage that from now on, you could move along the path that the 'first runner' had pierced in advance.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">When we actually took the escalator to the sixth floor, we saw movie posters torn to pieces.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">How many movies had been completed, the 6th floor was almost in a state of nothing but ruins.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the traces left here and there, it seemed that more than half of them were the workmanship of Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, as soon as he returned, he was the one who killed the 7th grade monster species. I couldn't guess how much stronger he would have become now.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Can I really change the ending of this story just because I go up?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I lost my confidence a bit, but I wasn't depressed.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">We got through the 6th floor without encountering any movies.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If we're lucky, we might be able to get to the roof as it is. Hurry up.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A little faster. A little bit more–</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Was it too hasty?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have been hit by the projection beam.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The screening of that floor begins.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I was shocked to hear the message.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Where?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It's all just torn movie posters?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's under your feet."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was torn, but the poster was underfoot.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The movie poster is broken]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Only part of the film is reproduced.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">With the feeling of the floor sinking, we were sucked into pitch black darkness. And when we woke up, we were locked in a room with white walls on six sides.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">rlaehrwk99 : Isn't that movie cue?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">rlaehrwk124: How old is 99?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The film is not in perfect condition.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can escape from the movie when you complete certain conditions.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, we didn't come into the whole movie.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">When I hit the inner wall several times with a white-blue steel machine, Literature Girl 64 said, "You can't pierce it by force."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I agreed with her.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I know roughly what movie it is."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Cube controlled room, and a possible escape when the condition is fulfilled.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was a film that the creators could not have known.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is the “escape condition.”</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Judging from the experience so far, there was a possibility that the owner of the theater did something annoying this time too.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">However.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is curious about your story.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', presents conditions for escape from the room to the Theater Owner.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation that has not yet revealed their modifier is curious about your story.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation that has not yet revealed a modifier presents the Room’s Escape Condition.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In addition, the constellations that did not reveal their modifiers?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Theater Owner accepts the constellations' offer.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to have a premonition of something disturbing, but the escape conditions were soon revealed.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>Escape condition: Talk in the room for 30 minutes.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">A clock appeared in the air.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[30:00.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I looked up at the watch blankly and thought.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Really? Are these all the conditions?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Additional narratives followed.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>However, if silence lasts for more than 30 seconds, all personnel in the room will die.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">I got goosebumps.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">There are three people in the room right now.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Me, Jung Heewon, and Literature Girl 64.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Since Jung Heewon passed out, it meant that I had to talk with Literature Girl 64 for 30 minutes.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't an atrocious condition, but I thought it wouldn't be easy.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I'm not the type to be that good at conversations, and neither is that-</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Even if there are only some of them."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Can this be called a movie?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Did you naturally bring up the topic first?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I was slightly moved by her consideration and replied with nothing.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"These days, the short form is the trend. Wouldn’t &lt;Star Stream&gt; also follow the trend?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What is the short form?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"So, you cut or summarized the highlights of the video, so to speak-"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Highlight."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Literature girl 64 thought hard and added.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Anything with only highlights, it doesn't even have an e-light."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Um... I agree."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Even though I agreed, I felt strangely stabbed by my conscience.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, I thought the writing I was writing was similar.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Composing a compact plot with minimal build-up, and pushing the highlights every time.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is yawning as if bored.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In a world where everything is a highlight, I have been writing with only highlights in mind. Is that why?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Uh, can I call you Yerin too? Or..."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much I think about it, this moment, which is not a highlight, felt a little fresh.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yerin is my real name."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Then...."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Call me whatever you like."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">“By the way, do you like novels?”</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah yes."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">“Do you like this novel too?”</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If this is a novel, then it must be referring to ORV. Can a novelist like the novels he wrote? Any novelist would do that.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Then what about me?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"My brother likes this novel."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What about you, Yerin-ssi?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Literature Girl 64 was silent for a moment.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You must continue the conversation within 15 seconds.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">She wondered if she should turn to another topic, but she answered.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I've never read it myself."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"My brother always read to me."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I had guessed her general circumstances.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Several clues came together naturally in my head.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Read ORV more than 10 times.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The habit of always wearing sunglasses.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The image of young siblings confronting RepresentativeKimDokja in the theater.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The figure of the girl holding the sleeves behind the boy naturally overlapped over Literature Girl 64's face.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"In real life, I'm blind."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">This time it was a self-indulgence for me to be silent.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You must continue the conversation within 10 seconds.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Even though I knew that I would die if I didn't speak up within 10 seconds, I couldn't easily come up with the next words.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, Literature Girl 64 continued.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I am fine now."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Okay."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"This is how the world my brother always talked about looks like."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What do you think of this novel?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Literature Girl 64, who hesitated for a moment and chose her words, opened her mouth.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I think it’s a novel that lacks perfection."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I was caught off guard and hit to the bone.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I felt that way the whole time I was listening to it. The characters are rather flat, and the story seems contrived."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"There is so much emotion in the directing. The further you go, the more monotonous the pattern of development is."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps it was an act, there was a strange rebuke in her voice. She seemed to be talking faster than before.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Are you actually someone who hates reading ORV?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It could be.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It is not strange that there are various readers in the world.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Because web novels are serialized daily. I understand. But give me a hole to breathe."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I asked with a bitter smile.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you often read web novels?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I sometimes ask my brother to read it to me, but it’s not my favorite genre."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Which genre do you like? Or even a favorite writer..."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Her ID is Literature Girl 64.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If it wasn't an ID given by Killer King, she'd probably like novels too.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As if she had waited, she opened her mouth.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Raymond Carver."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"…?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">“There is Haruki Murakami, Han River, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck...."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It seems that she has similar reading tastes to someone I know.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Literature Girl 64 nodded, probably reading my thoughts.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I think Yoo Sangah's taste in reading is excellent."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't tell if it was a joke or not, so I laughed out loud.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Literature Girl 64 didn't laugh.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I got a little nervous and asked the question again.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">“What is your favorite work?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, I thought it was good.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A room where you have to talk for the next 30 minutes to escape.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was a pleasure to have a topic to talk about after a long time. When it comes to novels, I have the confidence to talk about it for an hour or two. That was until I heard her next words.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I like 『The Origin of Memory』."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I thought maybe I had heard something wrong.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">What kind of novel do you like?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"That… You're talking about a Korean artist's work, right?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. You know."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't not know.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I know, but do you really like the work?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Because this novel…</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It is my favorite work."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It's mine. It was the debut work of “Lee Hakhyun.”</p>
