<p class="orv_line">With the explosion, thick dust rose from the ground.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Han Sooyoung!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I ran to the center of Gwanghwamun where Han Sooyoung fell. No matter how many times I shouted, there was no answer from Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Coo coo coo coo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Absolute Throne' at the center of Gwanghwamun was rising into the air.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Ooooooooooooo.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A faint cry was heard from far away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was undoubtedly a deity from another world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, the sound was too far away so I didn't vomit blood or faint, but the seriousness of the situation was clear.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 This is something that did not happen in the previous 'Absolute Throne'’s scenario. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The outer gods’ intervened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did Han Sooyoung fight something like that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hasn't she been trying to destroy this world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Han Sooyoung!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shouted once again, but Han Sooyoung was still nowhere to be seen. When the dust cleared, I saw the figure of Yoo Jonghyuk in the distance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy was in a limp state, as if he had fainted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Jonghyuk!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk's whole body was connected to a red thread extending from the 'Absolute Throne'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The soaring Absolute Throne and the fallen Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Very slowly, the distance between Yoo Jonghyuk and the throne was narrowing.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Throne Succession Ceremony' begins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The series of constellations continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Founder of the Absolute Throne. It was the will of that outer god.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey, look at that!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s Yoo Jonghyuk!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The surrounding incarnations, who discovered the sight belatedly, shouted loudly.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>["Wow, things are getting fun. Then, we will come to the finale of this scenario."]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">To make matters worse, the dokkaebi Paul appeared and activated a sub-scenario.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new sub-scenario has arrived.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Sub Scenario - Stealing the Throne&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Sub</p>

<p class="orv_line">The intermediate dokkaebi burst into laughter as if enjoying this whole situation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' diligently wipes his head.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' sighs and looks at the throne.]</p></div>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' mocks that no one has courage!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Although the constellations were afraid of the scenery, they did not take their eyes off it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though the scenario was presented, none of the incarnations moved easily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was natural.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The person who inherits the throne now is the supreme incarnation, Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no one who could challenge him, who single-handedly overthrew all kings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only one person.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Jonghyuk!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Except me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Jonghyuk! Get some sleep! If you sit there, it’s all over!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I headed toward the throne, defeated the crowd, and approached the throne.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It must be stopped. It can be prevented. It is not too late.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">What held me back was that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That’s it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A slender girl holding a long sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Lee Jihye."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk's royal guard was blocking the path leading to the throne.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Now, if you cross this line, you’ll die, you know?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Delusional Demon Kim Namwoon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In addition, there were groups of people who followed the king.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The king! Supreme King!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He is the new king of the Korean Peninsula!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A woman with her white hair disheveled was also seen in the center of the group.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Incarnation Lee Seolhwa.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized it again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk of the 41st round has already gathered so many colleagues.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This guy didn't rest for a single moment, and was steadily taking steps toward the end of this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I said you couldn’t go."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as I took a decisive step, Lee Jihye pulled out her sword. It wasn't just a threat. If I go one step further now, I will definitely get cut.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lightning struck from the sky, revealing the appearance of Yoo Jonghyuk, who was much closer to the throne.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung probably fought to stop it on her own.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The last time I met Han Sooyoung, I spoke smugly to her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I am also the author of this story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I'll try to convince you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I will complete the story you wrote.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So what was the story I wrote?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked around Gwanghwamun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Everything was in ruins.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dying incarnations wriggled on the floor. The stars in the sky twinkled as if they were mocking me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought I could do well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I believed I knew the whole story too.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World' activates intermittently.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Sentences of 'Ways of Survival' heard rarely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps this skill is a memory Han Sooyoung gave me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled bitterly out of frustration.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I didn't have this skill, I would have died early.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I slowly took another step forward, Lee Jihye’s sword, which had been pulled out at the same time, reached me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you move any further, I’ll have no choice but to cut you down."</p>
<p class="orv_line">While Yoo Jonghyuk was building his story, where and what was I doing?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Obviously, there were a lot of stories I wanted to tell. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to talk about characters who didn't receive attention in the main story. The lives of extras. I wanted to write a story for those who were forgotten in Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint and could not leave a single line of sentences.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to save Yoo Jonghyuk from the 41st round.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Was any of them correct? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">For the first time, I realized my lack of talent as a writer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am."</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I couldn't change this story. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I took one more step, looking straight at Lee Jihye’s sword.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 If this is my karma for ruining the story. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye's eyes, having decided on something, were colored with a harsh light. The moment when the girl's sword rushed towards me with the sound of cutting the wind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Jihye-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone grabbed Lee Jihye's blade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Please let Inho-ssi pass."</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was a woman shorter than me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi has work to do."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard her voice, a small warmth lingered deep in my heart.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Fable 'Recorder of things that will disappear' begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Warmth soon became a sentence.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The reader who was more scared than anyone else was there. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein. The second reader I met. Among the characters, the person who likes Jung Heewon the most. He is someone who grew up because he wanted to become strong like Lee Hyunsung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He must have suffered so much during this time that his body was full of wounds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sein-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a trembling body, Kyung Sein looked back at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how strong Kyung Sein became, his opponent was the protagonist of this story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is no match for him physically.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, Kyung Sein did not back down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don’t want to see this world destroyed."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye's expression hardened towards me, who listened to those words blankly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you going to fight us now?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her cold magic boiled over in her swordplay. This sword of wisdom, imbued with a deep blue sword, moved.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you know how strong I am?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you get hit by something like that, no matter how powerful you are, you cannot avoid fatal injuries.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Kyung Sein, embarrassed, hugged me and bent down, someone struck Lee Jihye's sword and derailed its trajectory. Someone kicked Lee Jihye’s blade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What-"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye stepped away while holding her wrist. Kim Namwoon, who was watching the scene, smiled with a happy attitude.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, what? This is getting fun?"</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 There was a reader there who had read more novels than anyone else. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Literature Girl 64.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ja Yerin activated [combat action mode] and struck down Lee Jihye's sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yerin. What is the time limit?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"3 minutes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We have to finish it within that time."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That’s enough."</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 There was a reader there who wanted to be Yoo Jonghyuk more than anyone else. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King Ja Sungwoo stretched out his hand to me who was sitting on the floor and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wake up, Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even during this time, I stood up while holding his hand, who did not lose sight of the concept.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye growled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you serious? Do you all want to die?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No one wants to die."</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 There was a reader there who wanted to see the ending of this world without sacrificing anyone. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansu, who was carrying Shin Yoosoung, put his hand on my shoulder and said,</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Everyone gathered here so that no one would die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">What was so funny about those words? Kim Namwoon, the delusional demon, burst out laughing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hahaha! That’s fun! It’s something you often see in novels."</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, the delusional demon’s sword made a sharp sound and looked at us. Magical power overflowed throughout his body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Tell me some great lines like that too, huh?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the delusional demon approached in an instant and stretched out his fist, Yerin's body floated in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Namwoon laughed after blocking the arrow fired by the enraged Killer King with his forearm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That toy looks fun."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Black Flame stretched out from Kim Namwoon's hand and burned Killer King's bowgun. What saved the siblings, who were suddenly in danger, was a bullet flying from somewhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Second apostle! Get down!"</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 There was also a reader there who was more rational than anyone else, but was actually more passionate than anyone else. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The smoke from the cannonballs covered the area along with the sound of doo-doo-doo-doo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo ran through the dust and supported his companions. Gong Pildu covered behind him. I also saw Max the dog barking next to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Pierce it! You must never give up the throne!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">With Ye Hyeonwoo’s command, the troops of Chungmuro ran shouting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the opponents were Lee Jihye and Kim Namwoon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's go!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kaaaaaaak!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">People who lost limbs in a single slash screamed. Ja Yerin and Killer King. Lee Dansu and Kyung Sein also joined.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, they have already overcome the scenario and have exhausted a lot of their stamina.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no way they could properly deal with Lee Jihye and Kim Namwoon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi, run!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I ran on the path that they had made for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I left behind the dizzying fear of life and quickened my steps. Even though I broke through the two lines of resistance, there were still many troops protecting Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All of this was the history built up by Yoo Jonghyuk of the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Stop him."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Following Lee Seolhwa's self-righteous command, Yoo Jonghyuk’s followers waved their military flags.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kill him! He’s trying to assassinate the king!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if [Incite] was used, it was a difficult number to handle. To force these people to step down through [Incite], I may not have enough magic power to destroy the 'absolute throne'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that a disturbing noise was heard from the left side of the troops.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kaaaaaaaa! What!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A crowd was running, breaking the ranks of followers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aaaah! Brother Inho!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A man who bumped his body here and there and pushed in like a tank.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A mother and daughter were also seen swinging kitchen knives to the left and right of the man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Bang Cheolsoo!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if responding to my shout, Bang Cheolsoo opened the road with a loud shout.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Go!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The way to the absolute throne was opened.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The people that Lee Hakhyun saved were there. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I ran the road they opened for me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 As if to say that his story is not wrong. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The people who lived such a sloppy story. Those who willingly accepted the clumsy changes I wrote, opened the path for me to run.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that something crashed into the center of the road.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A spirit that takes your breath away just by looking at it. A huge shadow as if Mount Tai was blocking my view.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi. I can’t allow you to advance any more."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk’s strongest shield, Lee Hyunsung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His large right hand moved towards my head. It was [Smashing Mount Tai].</p>
<p class="orv_line">I instinctively raised my magic power. If I am hit by that attack, I will be at least seriously injured.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly lowered my head to avoid his right hand. But his left hand was waiting below him. The [Taesan Push] embedded in the shield was pushed exactly in the direction I was avoiding. It was an unavoidable blow. The moment I opened my mouth to activate [Incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">A loud noise exploded before my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I rolled on the floor and looked forward, the first thing I saw was Lee Hyunsung's shocked face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How-"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The steel shield that Lee Hyunsung was holding was split in half and rolling on the floor. Something had pushed Lee Hyunsung’s attack and shattered his shield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I also understood his feelings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this point, the only incarnation with that level of power is Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 And there was a sword protecting him. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, in this 41st round, there was another incarnation with such power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Look at this. This is what happens when you leave me and go alone."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only incarnation in this world who is not afraid of Yoo Jonghyuk's sword.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The only sword that protected Kim Dokja in the third world line. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I said her name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’ll ask you what happened later, so get up first. There’s something you have to do, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, the judge of destruction, raised me up and spoke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do your job. I will deal with that big guy."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Stop!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung stretched out his hand in embarrassment, and Jung Heewon swung her sword at him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The strongest sword and the strongest shield collided, causing harsh vibrations to echo throughout the area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After leaving the fight between the two behind, I looked up into the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The distance between the absolute throne that was soaring high into the sky and Yoo Jonghyuk was not much now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no time to hesitate.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will receive a hidden scenario reward."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Pending 'Hidden Scenario' rewards will be paid.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have hunted a disaster for the first time in a scenario!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[An incredible achievement has been achieved!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[90,000 coins were obtained!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The management bureau grants you a scenario privilege.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can choose one of the items below as a reward.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p><!>[Black Flame Half Armor: SSS grade]</p>
<p><!>[Sylphid's Leaping Boots: SSS grade]</p>
<p><!>[Fire Dragon Egg: SS grade]</p>
<p>…</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">A mental list of perk items.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I answered without even reading the entire list.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sylphid’s Leaping Boots."</p>
<p class="orv_line">An item that Kim Dokja did not choose. But for me now, it was an item I needed more than anything else.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Obtained 'Sylphid’s Leaping Boots '!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My toes felt cool and a gentle breeze wrapped around my ankles.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Special option: Activates leap.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I just stepped into the air with all my might. As I rose all the way to the sky, Yoo Jonghyuk was finally right in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Jonghyuk."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now I have arrived.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, I was not yet ready to crush the absolute throne. This was because there was no one to speak up for the proclaimers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So, for now, I grabbed Yoo Jonghyuk. I thought it was distance that separated him from the throne, but the moment I held on to the guy's arm with all my strength, the space in front of my eyes suddenly shuddered.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Theatre of the Beginning' is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My vision swirled as if I was being sucked into a wall. When I came to my senses from dizziness. I was thrown into an unfamiliar place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Yoo Jonghyuk! Yoo Jonghyuk!</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Now the era of supremacy begins!</p>
<p class="orv_line">People's shouts heard through old speakers. I blinked and saw a huge screen. The scenery of Gwanghwamun was projected on the screen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at the scene blankly and slowly turned my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The familiar darkness of the theater captivated me. Hundreds of seats that glow in the dark. Hundreds of readers occupied those seats.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【You’ve finally arrived.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The kkomas Kim Dokja were looking at me. Some have a flushed face, some have a sad face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the center of them, someone was talking and clapping his hands at the wall.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Our abandoned protagonist.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, he was someone I knew well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Representative Kim Dokja stood up with a face full of joy and said.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Let us welcome '49% Kim Dokja' with joy.】</p></div>
