<div class="orv_quote"><p>「“Uriel. What on earth were you thinking when you brought that &#x27;sheep&#x27;?&quot;」</div>「“Uriel. What on earth were you thinking when you brought that 'sheep'?"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Archangel Uriel still remembers the events of that day.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Did you know that she didn&#x27;t know what kind of sheep the scribe asked her to bring him is?&quot;」</div>「"Did you know that she didn't know what kind of sheep the scribe asked her to bring him is?"」</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The voices of angels whispering as they looked at the sheep she was dragging.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel frowned at them and thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Knowing  what kind of &#x27;sheep&#x27; that &#x27;sheep&#x27; is. While you&#x27;re worrying about things like that, it&#x27;s better to pick off one more devil&#x27;s head.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Anyway, I brought ten of them?&quot;」</div>「"Anyway, I brought ten of them?"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her calling is to hunt down demons and kill the demon king. Archangel Uriel was born only for this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Countless numbers of demons died under her swordplay.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Devil. Ephedra. drank.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter what stars had the letter &#x27;Ma&#x27; attached to them, they could not escape her blade. Hundreds or even thousands of years for the lights of constellations belonging to the &#x27;absolute evil&#x27; go out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the unfathomable time of the month passed, the universe she belonged to gradually became darker.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Why are you killing the demon kings?&quot;」</div>「"Why are you killing the demon kings?"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">When was the last time she was asked that question? Was it when she heard that a new demon king had been launched on the border?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;I received orders.&quot;」</div>「"I received orders."」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;If it’s an order, is it to kill anyone?&quot;」</div>「"If it’s an order, is it to kill anyone?"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Like that , Uriel also killed the Demon King&#x27;s lover. Because that was also the order she received.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Daechonsai. You are like a demon king.&quot;」</div>「"Daechonsai. You are like a demon king."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King touched his lover who had lost her life and cursed silently.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Archangel who loves nothing. Someday, you too will love something. When that time comes, the fire you have caused will judge you.&quot;」</div>「"Archangel who loves nothing. Someday, you too will love something. When that time comes, the fire you have caused will judge you."」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Whatever.&quot;」</div>「"Whatever."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel laughed at those words and cut off the Demon King&#x27;s head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Demon-like judge of fire&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The name of hers, feared by archangels and by absolute evil, was thus determined.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the saying goes, she killed the demon kings. They were cut to death, stabbed to death, and beheaded. How many demon kings did she kill like that?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Uriel. Stop &#x27;hunting demons&#x27;.&quot;」</div>「"Uriel. Stop 'hunting demons'."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">One day, her mission was interrupted. This was because too many demon kings died.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;An armistice agreement has been concluded.&quot;」</div>「"An armistice agreement has been concluded."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">When she first heard about the agreement, Uriel thought that the Scribe was making a fuss about her again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But as a year, ten years, and even half a century passed without the war recurring, Uriel realized something was strange.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Wait a minute. This is really a truce?&quot;」</div>「"Wait a minute. This is really a truce?"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Uriel. I think I said that fifty years ago.&quot;」</div>「"Uriel. I think I said that fifty years ago."」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;No, really, really?&quot;」</div>「"No, really, really?"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;It&#x27;s really real.&quot;」</div>「"It's really real."」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Then can’t we kill the demon kings now?&quot;」</div>「"Then can’t we kill the demon kings now?"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;It&#x27;s not possible.&quot;」</div>「"It's not possible."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel was dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She is a being born to defeat all demon kings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She didn&#x27;t run so far to find this vague peace or to face this kind of ending.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;No. I will keep killing, I will kill everyone!&quot;」</div>「"No. I will keep killing, I will kill everyone!"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, after being bound and dragged into Jophiel&#x27;s [Bound for Good and Evil], Uriel wrote a memorandum.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;I swear in the name of the Archangel that from now on I will never touch the Demon Kings without an order from the Scribe...◼️. So what do you want me to do now? If I can&#x27;t even kill the Demon—&quot;」</div>「"I swear in the name of the Archangel that from now on I will never touch the Demon Kings without an order from the Scribe...◼️. So what do you want me to do now? If I can't even kill the Demon—"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Why do you have to kill?&quot;」</div>「"Why do you have to kill?"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Then?&quot;」</div>「"Then?"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;You can at least take care of the sheep.&quot;」</div>「"You can at least take care of the sheep."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first she thought it was a joke.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Sheep? What sheep?&quot;」</div>「"Sheep? What sheep?"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel was assigned to Zone 8 of the Garden of Eden—&#x27;Sheep Pasture&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;No, really?&quot;」</div>「"No, really?"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;It&#x27;s true. Don&#x27;t askme again in after 50 years this time.&quot;」</div>「"It's true. Don't askme again in after 50 years this time."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">How on earth did this happen?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did the archangel, who had been fighting demons until the end of the war, become a mere shepherd?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just then, a sheep lunged towards her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel reflexively moved her sword and struck the sheep&#x27;s head. As the fainted sheep fell down, a low-ranking angel who witnessed the scene came running screaming.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;W-Wh-Uriel-nim! What on earth are you doing?!&quot;」</div>「"W-Wh-Uriel-nim! What on earth are you doing?!"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;This guy rushed in first.&quot;」</div>「"This guy rushed in first."」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;it rushed in  because it’s happy to meet you!&quot;」</div>「"it rushed in  because it’s happy to meet you!"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel asked back in an annoyed voice, as if she didn&#x27;t know anything about that.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;But who are you?&quot;」</div>「"But who are you?"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Didn’t you hear anything from the Scribe ?&quot;」</div>「"Didn’t you hear anything from the Scribe ?"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was a low-level shepherd angel whose name she can&#x27;t even remember anymore.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;For me… please just call me Teacher Yang&quot;.」</div>「"For me… please just call me Teacher Yang".」</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was her first meeting with &#x27;Teacher Yang&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_notice"><p>yang = sheep in korean***</div>yang = sheep in korean***</p>
<p class="orv_line">Originally, no sheep lived in the Garden of Eden. This is because the &#x27;sheep&#x27; in &lt;Eden&gt; was only a metaphor until Uriel brought the sheep in question.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;It is a descendant of those sheep?&quot;」</div>「"It is a descendant of those sheep?"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that metaphor has now become real.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Yes.&quot;」</div>「"Yes."」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Don’t be kidding. I brought in 10 sheep.&quot;」</div>「"Don’t be kidding. I brought in 10 sheep."」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;How many years do you think it’s been since then?&quot;」</div>「"How many years do you think it’s been since then?"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel looked at the sheep running through the garden with blank eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One, two, three, four.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The number of sheep is so large that even if you fall asleep, you won&#x27;t notice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She suddenly came to her senses and asked.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;What about the children I brought?&quot;」</div>「"What about the children I brought?"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Uriel-sama. I&#x27;ll say it again, how many years do you think has passed...&quot;」</div>「"Uriel-sama. I'll say it again, how many years do you think has passed..."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">She said the sheep she brought in were already dead. A long time ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before she knew it, they had lived out their own lives and died. But they also gave birth to many children.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So the number of sheep in the Garden of Eden, which was only ten, became twenty, thirty, and over a hundred. And now.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Did you really not know? Our sheep are quite famous.&quot;」</div>「"Did you really not know? Our sheep are quite famous."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The amount has become so large that they even appear as helpers in people&#x27;s dreams.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;I recently gave one to the goddess Artemis who came to visit.&quot;」</div>「"I recently gave one to the goddess Artemis who came to visit."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is said that sometimes lambs are distributed to gods from other nebulae.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel, who had been listening to Teacher Yang&#x27;s boast with one ear, asked.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;How many banches are like this?&quot;」</div>「"How many banches are like this?"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;There are 72 in total.&quot;」</div>「"There are 72 in total."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel imagined sheep jumping around over 72 gardens. But it didn&#x27;t work out.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;It&#x27;s all thanks to Uriel.&quot;」</div>「"It's all thanks to Uriel."」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;What?&quot;」</div>「"What?"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;This is the peace we gained thanks to Uriel defeating the Demon Kings.&quot;」</div>「"This is the peace we gained thanks to Uriel defeating the Demon Kings."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sheep, who had fainted after being hit on the head earlier, was seen waking up again. The sheep that had been shaking their heads staggered towards Uriel again. </p>
<p class="orv_line">Teacher Yang bent down and stroked the sheep’s head. The sheep looked up at Uriel with a dumb expression and started eating the grass on the floor again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel slowly sat down on the floor while looking at the sheep.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely her first time seeing this sheep. But when she looked closely, it seemed like he was a descendant of the guy she once brought in.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;I see.&quot;」</div>「"I see."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">She doesn&#x27;t know what significance there was to the time she lived.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just counting the endless sheep, Uriel acknowledged that she was &#x27;temporarily&#x27; relieved of her duties after half a century.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that was the problem.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What should an archangel who has lived by picking off demon kings&#x27; heads for thousands of years do now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">She can spend a day or two watching and counting sheep, but she can&#x27;t just be a shepherd forever—</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Hmm?&quot;」</div>「"Hmm?"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel found Teacher Yang watching a video on a portable device next to her.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;You. What is that?&quot;」</div>「"You. What is that?"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Give it back too!&quot;」</div>「"Give it back too!"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;What are you looking at with this?&quot;」</div>「"What are you looking at with this?"」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Hey, it’s a sheep.&quot;」</div>「"Hey, it’s a sheep."」</p>
<p class="orv_line"> She found out later that Teacher Yang was addicted to &#x27;broadcasting&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;That... is a sock in a metaphorical sense.&quot;」</div>「"That... is a sock in a metaphorical sense."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel narrowed her eyes and glared at Teacher Yang&#x27;s small mobile device.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A video was playing inside the device.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Calm down, Yoo Sangah.&quot;」</div>「"Calm down, Yoo Sangah."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">And soon, for the first time, Uriel understands the meaning of &#x27;sheep&#x27; mentioned by Metatron.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Think of it this way. You are now in the game.&quot;」</div>「"Think of it this way. You are now in the game."」</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Now it was all a story of the distant past. Even though that much time had not passed, Uriel often felt somewhat distant when she looked back on that time.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Uriel.&quot;」</div>「"Uriel."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">A lot happened after that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Holy Demon War broke out again and she went to the battlefield again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Eden&gt; was destroyed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her scribes and other archangels died, and so did all the archangels who laughed at her when she brought her sheep.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;What about the sheep?&quot;」</div>「"What about the sheep?"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Teacher Yang said.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Today was the day I was supposed to shave their wool…&quot;」</div>「"Today was the day I was supposed to shave their wool…"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">A low-level angel who died without leaving behind any stories, leaving behind those foolish last words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel still didn&#x27;t  know his name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was left alone in &lt;Eden&gt;, a small garden where all scenarios had ended and there was not a single sheep left.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sometimes she would go down to earth and interact with the incarnations, sometimes she would meet Gabriel, and she would dance or sing when she was in the mood, but most of the time she was in this garden.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this garden she slept, and occasionally she ate something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And she saw a story.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Uriel, you know. This is just such a story.&quot;」</div>「"Uriel, you know. This is just such a story."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">She watched and watched one star die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only story she kept from her ruined world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The main character of that story is no longer in this world. No one knows where he went.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though she knew that fact — perhaps because she knew that fact — Uriel continued to enjoy the story without doing anything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And sometimes she thought about sheep.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She dreamed that her boy, her sheep, was living somewhere unknown to her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that world, he will meet new colleagues, a man, and experience a new history.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He may have started another group without her knowledge.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[It’s been a while. Eden&#x27;s &#x27;election&#x27;.]</div>[It’s been a while. Eden's 'election'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, Uriel thought she had heard wrong. Is it a dream?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This. Have you still been reading this story?]</div>[This. Have you still been reading this story?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much she thought about it, he was a being who could not appear here. Because in her memories, he found his ◼️◼️ and disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, she doesn&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s really dead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She knew nothing about his final moments in ◼️◼️.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, she wasn&#x27;t really interested.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You still like this story. You are also very consistent.]</div>[You still like this story. You are also very consistent.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, he spoke to her in his familiar tone of voice.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[But if you’ve seen this, isn’t it time to start wondering about the next episode?]</div>[But if you’ve seen this, isn’t it time to start wondering about the next episode?]</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[There is a place where you can see the next story.]</div>[There is a place where you can see the next story.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe this is an illusion. Maybe she&#x27;s hearing hallucinations because she&#x27;s been watching one story for too long. Nevertheless, Uriel wanted to believe his words.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Just keep in mind. You can only watch the story from there. There can be no intervention, no interference whatsoever.]</div>[Just keep in mind. You can only watch the story from there. There can be no intervention, no interference whatsoever.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it’s a fantasy, it’s okay. If only she could see that star once again.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Ah, finally, a new modifier is needed to enter there, because it is a place with some unusual rules.]</div>[Ah, finally, a new modifier is needed to enter there, because it is a place with some unusual rules.]</p>

To enter there, &#x27;animal&#x27; must be included in the modifier.]</div>[Hmm, there are a lot of sheep in your dreams. It just worked out well. To enter there, 'animal' must be included in the modifier.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">And that was the whole story of how Uriel came to this &#x27;scenario&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your temporary modifier is &#x27;The One Who Brought Ten Lambs&#x27;.]</div>[Your temporary modifier is 'The One Who Brought Ten Lambs'.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">Uriel was grateful for her story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She said she was very fortunate to have brought ten lambs to Eden at that time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was fortunate to meet Teacher Yang.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was very fortunate that she was the archangel of Eden, the Demon-like Judge of Fire.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thank you, Uriel.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The door to the teacher&#x27;s office was closing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel staggered towards the closing door.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Dok…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sparks fluttering lightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though it was a name allowed in this worldview, there were signs of a fallout.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps the world view had noticed. The name she just called wasn&#x27;t just a &#x27;role&#x27; that existed in this world.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The worldview warns you.]</div>[The worldview warns you.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s the story she loves most.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel shouted that name with all her might.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The door didn&#x27;t open.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The door to the teacher&#x27;s office closed, and the voice of the archangel I knew echoed beyond the door.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart was beating loudly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, &#x27;Teacher Yang&#x27; was Uriel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be exact, it is not the &#x27;Uriel&#x27; of this world line, but the Uriel from the 3rd round that I remember.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#x27;Demon-like Judge of Fire&#x27; who loved Kim Dokja’s story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One time I wanted to call her name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I couldn&#x27;t become the real Kim Dokja she was looking for, I wanted to repay her for her story. Even if in return she will suffer the punishment of this worldview.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I closed my eyes tightly, waiting for the possible aftereffects to strike from thin air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But no matter how long I waited, the aftermath did not come.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Like that.]</div>[Like that.]</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[Oh, that’s right.]</div>[Oh, that’s right.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Light slowly turned on in the principal&#x27;s office, and the principal&#x27;s face appeared.</p>
