<p class="orv_line">Misreading Association (誤讀協).</p>
<p class="orv_line">Initially, the site was a group of people collecting rare books.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a small club where they read books that were discontinued in Korea and were no longer</p>
<p class="orv_line">available or untranslated classics, and exchanged opinions among themselves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, as the number of members gradually increased and the site grew, problems began to</p>
<p class="orv_line">arise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Some of the members started to share illegally not only rare books, but also manhwa and novels</p>
<p class="orv_line">that had become regular series without permission.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As word got out that paid content was available for free, the site grew and grew, and it began to</p>
<p class="orv_line">take on the form of a business. Adult ads were plastered across the site, and illegal gambling</p>
<p class="orv_line">money flowed in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a few more years, the founding members disappeared, and the site turned into a completely</p>
<p class="orv_line">illegal sharing site.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After listening to Kyung Sein&#x27;s full explanation, I was confused.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You said the Seven Apostles fought the Misreading Association before.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah, yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then did the Seven Apostles fight that illegal site?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, that&#x27;s.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein looked at Killer King, and then added quietly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The Seven Apostles got into a fight with anonymous readers, who turned out to be people who</p>
<p class="orv_line">illegally read the novel on the &#x27;Misreading Association&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I finally understood what was going on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were referring to people who read and shared illegal copies of the novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, in this world, those who read the novel through that route were also transmigrated</p>
<p class="orv_line">here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#x27;t know about you, but there are many writers who stopped creating or even took their own</p>
<p class="orv_line">lives because of the Misreading Association.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They illegally consumed content that someone dedicated their life to. A lot of my favorite</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">authors have disappeared because of them.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, some of my fellow writers had stopped writing because of illegal sharing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is that why you fought them?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King shook his head without answering.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, I was impressed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As a writer, I&#x27;ve been frustrated by the lack of success in combating illegal sharing, but to have a</p>
<p class="orv_line">reader like Killer King be so proactive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was fighting for his life, and not just in the comments.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly wondered what kind of comments Killer King would have left.</p>

<p class="orv_line">I doubted my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Feeling my gaze, Killer King frowned at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you looking at?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Nothing, just.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you keep looking at me like that, I&#x27;ll kill you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You really sound like Yoo Joonghyuk.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a light groan, Killer King pushed himself up and pretended to look away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He reminded me of a sulky cousin, and I was about to tease him one more time when I heard a</p>
<p class="orv_line">voice behind me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey, thanks for saving me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Literary Girl 64, who had finally regained consciousness, lowered her head helplessly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I waved my hands and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, I was lucky.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I was lucky.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King added with a nuance that somehow made me feel good.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They didn&#x27;t take the random item box.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that, we stared at the shiny box the Ratmen had dropped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King and his sister were probably here for that box, too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as things were starting to get uncomfortable, Killer King spoke up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ll give it to you guys.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Literary Girl 64 nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi&#x27;s faces brighten up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, I shook my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, thank you, we&#x27;ll just take the rest of the items.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you serious?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. We have enough with the rest of the items.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at the items on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see the D grade items that Kim Dokja had picked up in the main story, as well as other</p>
<p class="orv_line">items that hadn&#x27;t appeared in the main story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if to give me one last chance, Killer King asked again.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Didn&#x27;t you read the novel properly? Don&#x27;t you realize the value of this item box?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Seriously, we have enough with the rest. Don&#x27;t insist.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King hesitated for a moment, then took the item box in his arms with a look of desire in</p>
<p class="orv_line">his eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I owe you. I will pay you back for sure.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With that, Killer King turned around and began to walk away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Literary Girl 64 bowed her head and ran after her brother.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi to organize the items, then escorted the Killing King</p>
<p class="orv_line">back to the entrance of the Edge of Darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just before we crossed the edge, Killer King paused.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Neither Dansoo ahjussi nor Kyung Sein could hear the conversation from here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I tried to kill you all.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You did, and it was a really bad thing.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why didn&#x27;t you tell them that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You didn&#x27;t kill us, did you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King frowned at me, as if he couldn&#x27;t figure it out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You, what&#x27;s your name?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheon Inho.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That Cheon Inho?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">For some reason, this name elicits the same reaction from everyone who hears it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I can&#x27;t believe you&#x27;re possessing that scumbag. I hope you&#x27;re not using the Cheoldoo Group to</p>
<p class="orv_line">kill people.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If I was, you&#x27;d be dead too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You...... Who the hell are you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shrugged and laughed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, Killer King&#x27;s eye flickered with black energy. He had activated the stigma [Eye of</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sin].</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was suddenly curious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What do I look like to you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In his eyes, &#x27;Cheon Inho&#x27; was marked as &#x27;the murderer of a 15 people&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I am Lee Hakhyun.」</div>「I am Lee Hakhyun.」</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Then what does &#x27;writer Lee Hakhyun&#x27; look like?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The next moment, Killer King&#x27;s eyes widened, his entire retina turning pitch black like it was full</p>
<p class="orv_line">of ink.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What did my sins read in his eyes?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Commander of the Red Cosmos&#x27; is startled!]</div>[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is startled!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsuchuchuchuchut!</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The stigma &#x27;Eye of Sin&#x27; has forcibly ended.]</div>[The stigma 'Eye of Sin' has forcibly ended.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Groaning in pain, Killer King looked at me with the eye that had used the stigma.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What the hell are you. No...... that can&#x27;t be, something must be broken.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Muttering to himself, the Killer King looked at me and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There is no way such a villain exists in this world.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King looked at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was looking at me with clear eyes that weren&#x27;t using [Eye of Sin], eyes that had probably read</p>
<p class="orv_line">Omniscient Reader 99 times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I wish you the blessing of the story.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those last words, Killer King walked away without looking back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The younger sister glanced in my direction a few times, then followed his brother into the</p>
<p class="orv_line">darkness beyond.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stood still and waved until they were completely out of sight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hopefully, they too would be blessed by the story.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Among the items that Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi had gathered, there were some that were</p>
<p class="orv_line">more useful than I thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You can have this shield, Sein-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As expected, &#x27;Old Iron Shield&#x27; is the rule for tankers.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Old Iron Shield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An item used by Lee Hyunsung in the original novel.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Among us, it was the most suited for Kyung Sein to use.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ll give you the Magic Power Recovery Bracelet.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is it okay if I take it...... Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi put the bracelet on his wrist as if it were a luxury watch and smiled happily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That bracelet should be quite useful, since he uses [Diverse Communication].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Other than that, there were rings with faint anti-demonic abilities and gloves that provided a very</p>
<p class="orv_line">slight defense boost.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s unfortunate, but at least this early, I can live with it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The last thing that caught my eye was an item that looked like spoiled jelly.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Item Information&gt;</p>
<p>Name: Unformed Idea</p>
<p>Rating: D</p>
<p>Description: A shapeless weapon of the past. It could have been anything, but ultimately became</p>
<p>nothing.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, I once designed an item like this. It was just a setting, and I didn&#x27;t think it</p>
<p class="orv_line">would be here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Once again, I feel certain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are countless &#x27;settings&#x27; in this world that didn&#x27;t make it into the main story, but remained in</p>
<p class="orv_line">my notes.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「So, did I make that settings, or did Han Sooyoung tell me about them?」</div>「So, did I make that settings, or did Han Sooyoung tell me about them?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that Kyung Sein spoke up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;By the way, Inho-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The random item box, why did you give it up?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered why she didn&#x27;t ask that yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the look on her face, she had been thinking about it for a while. People might think I&#x27;d lost the</p>
<p class="orv_line">first prize in the lotto.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well, this is more important to me right now than a winning lotto ticket.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Actually, I was wondering the same thing, mate.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi raised his hand cautiously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No wonder it looked strange in their eyes.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#x27;t just any item, but the &#x27;random item box&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was an essential item to restore Kim Dokja&#x27;s star relic, Unbroken Faith.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My reasoning for surrendering the item box was simple.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That box, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it anyway.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Someone else already used it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No way...... Who?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did those Misreading Association guys secretly use it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shook my head at Dansoo ahjussi&#x27;s words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Someone already came here before us.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#x27;m sure. It was just a moment, but I opened the item box myself to check. The item had already</p>
<p class="orv_line">been used to zero.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Was there a reader who came before us?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We started at Geumho Station and only got here today. Our friend who read Omniscient Reader</p>
<p class="orv_line">99 times arrived here today.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then who the hell could have.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Common sense tells me there&#x27;s only one person who can do this at this point.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if realizing who I was referring to, Kyung Sein swallowed hard and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yoo Joonghyuk.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was only about a stop and a half from Oksu Station to here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it was the same Yoo Joonghyuk who could defeat a 7th grade monster species with one hit, he</p>
<p class="orv_line">could come in an hour.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who was thinking about something, muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, in the third round, Yoo Joonghyuk stole only the treasures, but I don&#x27;t remember him</p>
<p class="orv_line">knowing about the &#x27;random item box&#x27; back then.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There&#x27;s a description that mentions he heard about it from the Heavenly Maid Hori in the 6th</p>
<p class="orv_line">round. It&#x27;s the 41st round, so of course he knew.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein lowered her head with a dejected expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi, who had a serious look on his face, also shook his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s certainly a lot different from the 3rd round with Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Very different.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Even though it was only the 41st round, Yoo Joonghyuk here had much different experiences</p>
<p class="orv_line">than the 3rd round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s probably safe to say that many of the items that Kim Dokja utilized in the beginning, Yoo</p>
<p class="orv_line">Joonghyuk would take first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein suddenly raised her head and opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait, so the box Killer King took earlier.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He must be angry that he was tricked by the villain. Kyung Sein asked with admiration.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow...... Inho-ssi, when did you plan that much?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;When I realized the box had been robbed.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;re so mean and smart.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s good I&#x27;m on your side, Inho-ssi. Although it&#x27;s a shame about the box.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi said, looking around at the items we had won.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Still, we got a lot of stuff.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#x27;t all fruitless though, as we got some useful items in the beginning, including the ahjussi&#x27;s</p>
<p class="orv_line">bracelet and Kyung Sein&#x27;s shield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it&#x27;s a shame to just take these.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pondered for a moment, and then looked again at the place where the &#x27;random item box&#x27; was</p>
<p class="orv_line">originally placed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was around here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I crouched down on the ground and started digging.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi and Kyung Sein looked puzzled at my sudden movement. I turned to them and</p>
<p class="orv_line">said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you don&#x27;t mind, please help me. Something is bothering me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did Omniscient Reader say there was something else here?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, I don&#x27;t think so.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wasn&#x27;t sure either, but it was better than not checking.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Author-nim. I think it&#x27;s a little...... no matter how popular it is these days.&quot;」</div>「"Author-nim. I think it's a little...... no matter how popular it is these days."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I heard Ji Eunyoo&#x27;s voice in my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a memory from five years ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was working hard on the first draft of &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then what should I do?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think it&#x27;s better to go with the first draft.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That sounds good, right?&quot;」</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know how long the three of us dug.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt something hard on my fingertips.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ugh, what&#x27;s here?&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Sneaking Schemer&#x27; widens their eyes.]</div>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' widens their eyes.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">We shook off the dirt, lifting the object in the hole at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a moment, the pitch black dirt slid away, revealing the object we had pulled out.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Rice Cake-Eating Tiger&#x27; opens his mouth.]</div>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' opens his mouth.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation who hasn&#x27;t revealed their modifier is surprised.]</div>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is surprised.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">What we found was a black box with a familiar appearance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi and Kyung Sein looked down at the box in a daze, then turned to me and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi, is this......?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered Ji Eunyoo&#x27;s words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Originally, there was more than one &#x27;random item box&#x27; hidden here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Author&#x27;s Note</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I keep digging, will it keep coming out?</p>
<p class="orv_line">T/N: I&#x27;m paying for the chapters, so if you can, please support the authors by buying them on</p>
