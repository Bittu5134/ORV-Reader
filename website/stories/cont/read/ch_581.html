<p class="orv_line">This is how a criminal caught in an absurd place feels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was a little resentful of Dansoo ahjussi, who stretched out without knowing my mind. If he had</p>
<p class="orv_line">picked Jophiel back then, none of this would have happened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I turned to the oncoming Killer King and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait a minute. Listen to me. You asked me if I had anything left to say.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I didn&#39;t say I&#39;d listen. I wasn&#39;t interested in hearing your excuses for slaughtering a dozen people</p>
<p class="orv_line">in the first place.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, [Eye of Sin] had recorded the nineteen people I killed with &#39;demagogy killing&#39; as a</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;sin&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was unfair.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to tell them everything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was actually the one who wrote Omniscient Reader, and the people I killed were the ones who</p>
<p class="orv_line">would later become the evil &#39;Cult of Life&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You look upset. You think your killing was justified, because that&#39;s the way this world works.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a sense, it was the truth, so I had nothing to say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The Misreading Association were just like you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Misreading Association?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King looked wordlessly in his sister&#39;s direction, and Literary Girl 64 shook her head</p>
<p class="orv_line">stubbornly. It seemed like she didn&#39;t want to fight me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yerin, we have to kill him now. The Eye of Sin isn&#39;t wrong, he&#39;s dangerous.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We&#39;ll do it like we did with the Misreading Association guys, I&#39;ll finish him off.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard those words, the back of my head tingled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, an unpleasant sensation crawled up my spine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you kill a &#39;real person&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are there real persons and a fake persons?&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You know what I mean. Did you kill other readers?&quot;</p>
「&quot;No one who has read the Book of Revelation all the way through is a bad person.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t entirely disagree with Kyung Sein. There are certainly good and bad people among the</p>
<p class="orv_line">readers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But whether they were good or bad, there is a bond that only those who have read the story</p>
<p class="orv_line">share.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I would like to believe that there is a promise, at least between fellow &#39;readers&#39;, that we wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p class="orv_line">turn a blind eye to anyone who knew the tragedy of this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The &#39;Misreading Association&#39; deserve to die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, right in front of me, there was a reader who disagreed.</p>

<p>Judging from Killer King and Literary Girl 64&#39;s attitude, it was unlikely that they would charge</p>
<p>straight at me.</p>
<p>That said, the danger wasn&#39;t coming from them.</p>
<p>The next time I looked up at the ceiling, I saw the culprit.</p>
<p>Since when?</p>
<p>Through the shadows of the &#39;Edge of Darkness&#39;, three shadows slid down the wall, clinging to it.</p>
<p>The moment I saw the series of footprints on the wall, I realized how they had managed to come</p>
<p>so stealthily.</p>
<p>A stealthy maneuvering skill that, while not as spectacular as Lee Jihye&#39;s [Ghost Walk], allows</p>
<p>them to literally move like &#39;dead rats&#39; in the dark.</p>
<p>All three of them had small tear gas canisters in their hands, so it doesn&#39;t look like they&#39;re</p>
<p>approaching for good.</p>
<p>Judging by the distance, they&#39;ll attack in about 1.8 seconds.</p>
<p>At this rate, Killer King and Literary Girl 64 would die, or at least be mortally wounded.</p>
<p>Killer King was going to kill me anyway, so I might as well leave them be.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「Villain&#39;s Crisis.」</p>
<p></p>
<p>I looked at the scene title and thought.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「But &#39;whose&#39; crisis is this?」</p>
<p>I began to type a sentence.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[This story is plausible.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[This story&#39;s reproduction success rate is 90%.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[There&#39;s enough probability.]</p>

<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Successfully recreating the scene.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Leaving the &#39;Snowfield&#39;.]</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「At that moment, Cheon Inho threw the spike in his right hand forward.」</p>
<p>&quot;What—?&quot;</p>
<p>The contemplative Killer King and Literary Girl 64 rolled their bodies to avoid the attack.</p>
<p>However, my spike wan&#39;t aimed at them.</p>
<p>Piyuuuu!</p>
<p>As my level 20 strength turned into kinetic energy and pierced through the darkness, the shadows</p>
<p>lurking between them let out a harsh sound and tore apart.</p>
<p>Something dripped through the darkness, and then something exploded in the air.</p>
<p>Chiiiik!</p>
<p>Thick purple smoke billowed out. I immediately recognized the smoke for what it was.</p>
<p>Poisonous fog.</p>
<p>Killer King&#39;s complexion turned blue.</p>
<p>&quot;Yerin!&quot;</p>
<p>The younger sister, who was very agile, quickly picked up her brother and took refuge near me.</p>
<p>I raised my hands in a sign that I had no intention of attacking. Literary Girl 64 dropped Killer</p>
<p>King on the ground and began to vomit. She must have inhaled the poisonous fog.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I asked Killer King.</p>
<p>&quot;Who are they?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You would know better.......&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I knew, I wouldn&#39;t be asking.&quot;</p>
<p>Before he could answer, Killer King began to bleed.</p>
<p>His poisoning seemed worse.</p>
<p>Apparently, this was no ordinary poisonous fog. It was poison taken directly from the anal sac of</p>
<p>a &#39;poisonous rhinoceros&#39;.</p>
<p>I took out my emergency supply of Elaine Monkey&#39;s Lungs and popped one into my mouth, then</p>
<p>handed the other to Killer King.</p>
<p>Killer King&#39;s eyes shook for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;Hurry up and bite it. Before you die.&quot;</p>
<p>Just before he took the lungs and bit them, Killer King spoke in a low voice.</p>
<p>&quot;They are the Misreading Association.&quot;</p>
<p>The Misreading Association. I see.</p>
<p>So that&#39;s who they are.</p>
<p>The Seven Apostles had the cute side of utilizing Dionysus&#39;s indirect messages as a code, but</p>
<p>they didn&#39;t seem to have that.</p>
<p>Ssssssss.</p>
<p>Through the thick violet fog, the men with Elaine Monkey&#39;s Lungs in their mouths emerged.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, all three had grayish hairs sprouting from their faces.</p>
<p>I immediately activated &#39;Readers&#39; Comments List&#39;.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The exclusive skill &#39;Readers&#39; Comments List&#39; is activated!]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The person is not a &#39;reader&#39;.]</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t &#39;Misreading Association&#39; the name of a readers&#39; community?</p>
<p>I activated &#39;Character List&#39; just in case.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, all three men were &#39;characters&#39;. They even had the same sponsor and attribute.</p>
<p>Plague-Carrying Rat.</p>
<p>And Ratman.</p>
<p>All incarnations of the same constellation, all choosing the path of the outcast (人外).</p>
<p>Even though the outer species were strong in the beginning, did my friends who finished the</p>
<p>novel choose the outer species&#39;s path?</p>
<p>It couldn&#39;t be.</p>
<p>They&#39;re not readers.</p>
<p>Then why did the Killer King call them the &#39;Misreading Association&#39;?</p>
<p>It was then that I heard a squeak in my ear.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Your exclusive attribute is activated.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[You understand the language settings.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[You are interpreting the language of the Ratmen.]</p>
<p>And then a voice said.</p>
<p>—How&#39;s Killer King?</p>
<p></p>
<p>—Poisoned.</p>
<p>—His sister.</p>
<p>—Same. She can still move, but not for long.</p>
<p>—There are others I haven&#39;t seen.</p>
<p>I&#39;m getting more and more confused.</p>
<p>I thought only the readers could know that.</p>
<p>But how can people who&#39;ve only been in this world for three days do that?</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, excuse me. Guys.&quot;</p>
<p>The men were talking amongst themselves, as if they couldn&#39;t hear me.</p>
<p>—I can tell he&#39;s an apostle because he has monkey&#39;s lungs.</p>
<p>—Is he a member of the Seven Apostles?</p>
<p>—Most likely.</p>
<p>—We&#39;ll have to get rid of him.</p>
<p>I was no match for the three of those rascals.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Sneaking Schemer&#39; looks down at his incarnation with a pitiable glance.]</p>
<p>At that moment, Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi, who were sprawled on the floor, began to</p>
<p>twitch.</p>
<p>It looks like the poisonous fog is slowly spreading to them.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the two of them had eaten a lot of ground rat meat before falling asleep, so they</p>
<p>should be able to hold out a bit longer with the antidote effect.</p>
<p>&quot;Narrowed eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>I turned my head to see a gasping Killer King staring back at me. His entire face was colored a</p>
<p>deep purple, as if the Elaine Monkey&#39;s Lungs couldn&#39;t keep up.</p>
<p>He&#39;s even weaker than he look. Didn&#39;t he level up any stats?</p>
<p>&quot;Are you sure...... you&#39;re not from the &#39;Misreading Association&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know such people.&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The other person has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p>
<p>Killer King opened his mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ll believe you. You are certainly—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m no prophet, but I do know that it&#39;s not time for us to fight amongst ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Nodding, Killer King handed the monkey&#39;s lung he&#39;d been biting to his sister.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;Yerin, I&#39;m sorry, you&#39;ll have to do it alone this time.&quot;</p>
<p>Literary Girl 64 shook her head hard, but finally took the lung with trembling hands.</p>
<p>Killer King coughed and spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;The enemy is a low-ranked outer species. Around an an 8th to 9th grade pattern, but...... you</p>
<p>should be able to deal with them by yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>I seemed to recognize this brother and sister&#39;s fighting style. Apparently, the older brother, Killer</p>
<p>King, would be the brains, while the younger sister would do the actual fighting.</p>
<p>Killer King looked in my direction and said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t trust you. But.......&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;ll owe me a favor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ll pay you back if I can.&quot;</p>
<p>With those last words, Killer King closed his eyes. He didn&#39;t seem to be dead, just trying to</p>
<p>survive his poisoning by minimizing his energy consumption.</p>
<p>I turned to the younger sister.</p>
<p>&quot;I need you to take care of one. We need to finish this before your brother dies.&quot;</p>
<p>Literary Girl 64 staggered to her feet, as if she would do anything.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Ratmen&#39;s side had finished analyzing this side&#39;s power.</p>
<p>—Random item box secured.</p>
<p>—We have a variable, should we rush in?</p>
<p>—Killer King must be eliminated here. If we don&#39;t get rid of him now, we might not have a</p>
<p>chance in the future.</p>
<p>The Ratmen exchanged sullen glances.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Plague-Carrying Rat&#39; laughs sneeringly.]</p>
<p>The next moment, I felt a chill down the back of my neck.</p>
<p>It&#39;s like hundreds of rats were glaring at me through the purple fog.</p>
<p>The Ratmen, rising like tumblers, surrounded me.</p>
<p>The Ratman is an 8th grade outer species.</p>
<p>All three of them had excellent stats, and their attribute bonuses made them extremely fast.</p>
<p>Luckily, Literary Girl 64, who ran like a flash, took on one of the Ratmen, and an</p>
<p>unconventional hand-to-hand battle ensued.</p>
<p>Literary Girl 64&#39;s movements were slower than before due to her poisoning, but it seemed to be</p>
<p>enough to take down one Ratman.</p>
<p>That left two.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A Ratman&#39;s elongated nails sliced into my skull with obvious murderous intent.</p>
<p>I&#39;m terrified. I&#39;ll die if I do something wrong.</p>
<p>I muttered an incantation to make myself stronger.</p>
<p>Joonghyuk.」</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The exclusive skill &#39;Incite Lv.3&#39; is activated!]</p>
<p>Of course, just inciting myself to be Yoo Joonghyuk didn&#39;t really make me Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>But it would at least make me brave like him. And maybe I could even imitate him a little.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「A pale trajectory sliced through the air.」</p>
<p>Sugagak!</p>
<p>My strength level 20 blow sliced through the air, tearing the arm of one of the Ratmen in two.</p>
<p>Surprised by my strength, the Ratmen jumped back.</p>
<p>—Dangerous. The variable&#39;s strength level exceeds 20.</p>
<p>—He&#39;s not afraid to get hurt. He&#39;s not an ordinary guy.</p>
<p>—Stay away. We&#39;ll change the operation.</p>
<p>In an instant, the Ratmen had closed the distance and drawn out a long bamboo pole.</p>
<p>I had an ominous feeling.</p>
<p>&quot;Dodge!&quot;</p>
<p>I reflexively jumped out of the way and swung my sword. I heard the sound of something</p>
<p>bouncing off a Ratman&#39;s blade. But I didn&#39;t manage to deflect them all.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah.&quot;</p>
<p>When I looked around, Literary Girl 64 had a dagger stuck in her thigh.</p>
<p>I quickly supported her and stepped back.</p>
<p>Literary Girl 64&#39;s complexion immediately turned purple.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>—His agility level is over 20.</p>
<p>—Is there ever an apostle with two stats over 20?</p>
<p>—Maybe it&#39;s an apostle possessing a named.</p>
<p>—Is he from &lt;Kim Dokja&#39;s Company&gt;?</p>
<p>The Ratmen craned their necks and looked up into the air at the same time. Like terminals</p>
<p>waiting for a signal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>—Says no.</p>
<p>—Then let&#39;s get rid of him.</p>
<p>In that moment, I came up with a creepy hypothesis.</p>
<p>The Ratmen in front of me were not &#39;readers&#39;, but they knew information that only &#39;readers&#39; could</p>
<p>know.</p>
<p>That means someone is feeding them information.</p>
<p>Maybe someone who could communicate with them in real time.</p>
<p>I reflexively looked up into the air.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「Did all of the &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39; readers really only possess &#39;incarnations&#39;?」</p>
<p>From across the pitch-black darkness, I felt a gaze upon me.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Plague-Carrying Rat&#39; looks down on you.]</p>
<p>I thought with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>Sooyoung-ah, isn&#39;t this a probability problem?</p>
<p>Author&#39;s Note</p>
<p>Hakhyun-ah, Sooyoung is also busy right now</p>
