<p class="orv_line">This is how a criminal caught in an absurd place feels.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I was a little resentful of Dansoo ahjussi, who stretched out without knowing my mind. If he had</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">picked Jophiel back then, none of this would have happened.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I turned to the oncoming Killer King and said.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait a minute. Listen to me. You asked me if I had anything left to say."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn't say I'd listen. I wasn't interested in hearing your excuses for slaughtering a dozen people</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">in the first place."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, [Eye of Sin] had recorded the nineteen people I killed with 'demagogy killing' as a</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">'sin'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was unfair.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to tell them everything.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I was actually the one who wrote Omniscient Reader, and the people I killed were the ones who</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">would later become the evil 'Cult of Life'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"You look upset. You think your killing was justified, because that's the way this world works."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In a sense, it was the truth, so I had nothing to say.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"The Misreading Association were just like you."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Misreading Association?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King looked wordlessly in his sister's direction, and Literary Girl 64 shook her head</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">stubbornly. It seemed like she didn't want to fight me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yerin, we have to kill him now. The Eye of Sin isn't wrong, he's dangerous."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"We'll do it like we did with the Misreading Association guys, I'll finish him off."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard those words, the back of my head tingled.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, an unpleasant sensation crawled up my spine.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you kill a 'real person'?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Are there real persons and a fake persons?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"You know what I mean. Did you kill other readers?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "No one who has read the Book of Revelation all the way through is a bad person." 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I don't entirely disagree with Kyung Sein. There are certainly good and bad people among the</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">readers.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"The 'Misreading Association' deserve to die."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">However, right in front of me, there was a reader who disagreed.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A reader who had read this story 99 times, a reader who probably understood this world better</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">than anyone.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Good. They were sociopaths to begin with."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, I was convinced. This Killer King is out of his mind.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If I let him go, he would ruin the whole scenario, not to mention endanger the other readers.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">But can I win against them?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If Killer King wasn't bad enough, Literary Girl 64 over there was a monster who could deal with</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">the Dark Keeper alone.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that the surroundings began to turn colorless.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Time stopped. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Signs of the skill '⬜⬜'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">However, I didn't see anyone doing anything 'unexpected'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Why then?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your skill has reached a certain level.]</p></div>

<p>2. An important 'event' branch occurs (limited to 3 times per day).</p>
<p></p>
<p>+</p>
<p>Perhaps because I used the skill a lot, a new condition to trigger '⬜⬜' has been added.</p>
<p>If the skill is triggered now, it means that an important 'event' branch is coming.</p>
<p>And in Omniscient Reader, 'important' is the same as 'dangerous'.</p>

<p><!>[You can stay in the 'Snowfield' for a total of 5 minutes.]</p>
<p>Judging from Killer King and Literary Girl 64's attitude, it was unlikely that they would charge</p>
<p>straight at me.</p>
<p>That said, the danger wasn't coming from them.</p>
<p>The next time I looked up at the ceiling, I saw the culprit.</p>
<p>Since when?</p>
<p>Through the shadows of the 'Edge of Darkness', three shadows slid down the wall, clinging to it.</p>
<p>The moment I saw the series of footprints on the wall, I realized how they had managed to come</p>
<p>so stealthily.</p>
<p>A stealthy maneuvering skill that, while not as spectacular as Lee Jihye's [Ghost Walk], allows</p>
<p>them to literally move like 'dead rats' in the dark.</p>
<p>All three of them had small tear gas canisters in their hands, so it doesn't look like they're</p>
<p>approaching for good.</p>
<p>Judging by the distance, they'll attack in about 1.8 seconds.</p>
<p>At this rate, Killer King and Literary Girl 64 would die, or at least be mortally wounded.</p>
<p>Killer King was going to kill me anyway, so I might as well leave them be.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p><&>「Villain's Crisis.」</p>
<p></p>
<p>I looked at the scene title and thought.</p>
<p><&>「But 'whose' crisis is this?」</p>
<p>I began to type a sentence.</p>
<p><!>[This story is plausible.]</p>
<p><!>[This story's reproduction success rate is 90%.]</p>
<p><!>[There's enough probability.]</p>
<p><!>[Do you want to check the reader's feedback?]</p>

<hr>
<div class="orv_window">
<p><!>[Successfully recreating the scene.]</p>
<p><!>[Leaving the 'Snowfield'.]</p>
<p><&>「At that moment, Cheon Inho threw the spike in his right hand forward.」</p>
<p>"What—?"</p>
<p>The contemplative Killer King and Literary Girl 64 rolled their bodies to avoid the attack.</p>
<p>However, my spike wan't aimed at them.</p>
<p>Piyuuuu!</p>
<p>As my level 20 strength turned into kinetic energy and pierced through the darkness, the shadows</p>
<p>lurking between them let out a harsh sound and tore apart.</p>
<p>Something dripped through the darkness, and then something exploded in the air.</p>
<p>Chiiiik!</p>
<p>Thick purple smoke billowed out. I immediately recognized the smoke for what it was.</p>
<p>Poisonous fog.</p>
<p>Killer King's complexion turned blue.</p>
<p>"Yerin!"</p>
<p>The younger sister, who was very agile, quickly picked up her brother and took refuge near me.</p>
<p>I raised my hands in a sign that I had no intention of attacking. Literary Girl 64 dropped Killer</p>
<p>King on the ground and began to vomit. She must have inhaled the poisonous fog.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I asked Killer King.</p>
<p>"Who are they?"</p>
<p>"You would know better......."</p>
<p>"If I knew, I wouldn't be asking."</p>
<p>Before he could answer, Killer King began to bleed.</p>
<p>His poisoning seemed worse.</p>
<p>Apparently, this was no ordinary poisonous fog. It was poison taken directly from the anal sac of</p>
<p>a 'poisonous rhinoceros'.</p>
<p>I took out my emergency supply of Elaine Monkey's Lungs and popped one into my mouth, then</p>
<p>handed the other to Killer King.</p>
<p>Killer King's eyes shook for a moment.</p>
<p>"Hurry up and bite it. Before you die."</p>
<p>Just before he took the lungs and bit them, Killer King spoke in a low voice.</p>
<p>"They are the Misreading Association."</p>
<p>The Misreading Association. I see.</p>
<p>So that's who they are.</p>
<p>The Seven Apostles had the cute side of utilizing Dionysus's indirect messages as a code, but</p>
<p>they didn't seem to have that.</p>
<p>Ssssssss.</p>
<p>Through the thick violet fog, the men with Elaine Monkey's Lungs in their mouths emerged.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, all three had grayish hairs sprouting from their faces.</p>
<p>I immediately activated 'Readers' Comments List'.</p>
<p><!>[The exclusive skill 'Readers' Comments List' is activated!]</p>
<p><!>[The person is not a 'reader'.]</p>
<p>That's strange.</p>
<p>Wasn't 'Misreading Association' the name of a readers' community?</p>
<p>I activated 'Character List' just in case.</p>
<p>Then.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, all three men were 'characters'. They even had the same sponsor and attribute.</p>
<p>Plague-Carrying Rat.</p>
<p>And Ratman.</p>
<p>All incarnations of the same constellation, all choosing the path of the outcast (人外).</p>
<p>Even though the outer species were strong in the beginning, did my friends who finished the</p>
<p>novel choose the outer species's path?</p>
<p>It couldn't be.</p>
<p>They're not readers.</p>
<p>Then why did the Killer King call them the 'Misreading Association'?</p>
<p>It was then that I heard a squeak in my ear.</p>
<p><!>[Your exclusive attribute is activated.]</p>
<p><!>[You understand the language settings.]</p>
<p><!>[You are interpreting the language of the Ratmen.]</p>
<p>And then a voice said.</p>
<p>—How's Killer King?</p>
<p></p>
<p>—Poisoned.</p>
<p>—His sister.</p>
<p>—Same. She can still move, but not for long.</p>
<p>—There are others I haven't seen.</p>
<p>I'm getting more and more confused.</p>
<p>I thought only the readers could know that.</p>
<p>But how can people who've only been in this world for three days do that?</p>
<p>"Hey, excuse me. Guys."</p>
<p>The men were talking amongst themselves, as if they couldn't hear me.</p>
<p>—I can tell he's an apostle because he has monkey's lungs.</p>
<p>—Is he a member of the Seven Apostles?</p>
<p>—Most likely.</p>
<p>—We'll have to get rid of him.</p>
<p>I was no match for the three of those rascals.</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' looks down at his incarnation with a pitiable glance.]</p>
<p>At that moment, Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi, who were sprawled on the floor, began to</p>
<p>twitch.</p>
<p>It looks like the poisonous fog is slowly spreading to them.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the two of them had eaten a lot of ground rat meat before falling asleep, so they</p>
<p>should be able to hold out a bit longer with the antidote effect.</p>
<p>"Narrowed eyes."</p>
<p>I turned my head to see a gasping Killer King staring back at me. His entire face was colored a</p>
<p>deep purple, as if the Elaine Monkey's Lungs couldn't keep up.</p>
<p>He's even weaker than he look. Didn't he level up any stats?</p>
<p>"Are you sure...... you're not from the 'Misreading Association'?"</p>
<p>"I don't know such people."</p>
<p><!>[The other person has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p>
<p>Killer King opened his mouth.</p>
<p>"I'll believe you. You are certainly—"</p>
<p>"I'm no prophet, but I do know that it's not time for us to fight amongst ourselves."</p>
<p>Nodding, Killer King handed the monkey's lung he'd been biting to his sister.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Yerin, I'm sorry, you'll have to do it alone this time."</p>
<p>Literary Girl 64 shook her head hard, but finally took the lung with trembling hands.</p>
<p>Killer King coughed and spoke.</p>
<p>"The enemy is a low-ranked outer species. Around an an 8th to 9th grade pattern, but...... you</p>
<p>should be able to deal with them by yourself."</p>
<p>I seemed to recognize this brother and sister's fighting style. Apparently, the older brother, Killer</p>
<p>King, would be the brains, while the younger sister would do the actual fighting.</p>
<p>Killer King looked in my direction and said.</p>
<p>"I don't trust you. But......."</p>
<p>"You'll owe me a favor."</p>
<p>"I'll pay you back if I can."</p>
<p>With those last words, Killer King closed his eyes. He didn't seem to be dead, just trying to</p>
<p>survive his poisoning by minimizing his energy consumption.</p>
<p>I turned to the younger sister.</p>
<p>"I need you to take care of one. We need to finish this before your brother dies."</p>
<p>Literary Girl 64 staggered to her feet, as if she would do anything.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Ratmen's side had finished analyzing this side's power.</p>
<p>—Random item box secured.</p>
<p>—We have a variable, should we rush in?</p>
<p>—Killer King must be eliminated here. If we don't get rid of him now, we might not have a</p>
<p>chance in the future.</p>
<p>The Ratmen exchanged sullen glances.</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Plague-Carrying Rat' laughs sneeringly.]</p>
<p>The next moment, I felt a chill down the back of my neck.</p>
<p>It's like hundreds of rats were glaring at me through the purple fog.</p>
<p>The Ratmen, rising like tumblers, surrounded me.</p>
<p>The Ratman is an 8th grade outer species.</p>
<p>All three of them had excellent stats, and their attribute bonuses made them extremely fast.</p>
<p>Luckily, Literary Girl 64, who ran like a flash, took on one of the Ratmen, and an</p>
<p>unconventional hand-to-hand battle ensued.</p>
<p>Literary Girl 64's movements were slower than before due to her poisoning, but it seemed to be</p>
<p>enough to take down one Ratman.</p>
<p>That left two.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A Ratman's elongated nails sliced into my skull with obvious murderous intent.</p>
<p>I'm terrified. I'll die if I do something wrong.</p>
<p>I muttered an incantation to make myself stronger.</p>
<p>Joonghyuk.」</p>
<p><!>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.3' is activated!]</p>
<p>Of course, just inciting myself to be Yoo Joonghyuk didn't really make me Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>But it would at least make me brave like him. And maybe I could even imitate him a little.</p>
<p><&>「A pale trajectory sliced through the air.」</p>
<p>Sugagak!</p>
<p>My strength level 20 blow sliced through the air, tearing the arm of one of the Ratmen in two.</p>
<p>Surprised by my strength, the Ratmen jumped back.</p>
<p>—Dangerous. The variable's strength level exceeds 20.</p>
<p>—He's not afraid to get hurt. He's not an ordinary guy.</p>
<p>—Stay away. We'll change the operation.</p>
<p>In an instant, the Ratmen had closed the distance and drawn out a long bamboo pole.</p>
<p>I had an ominous feeling.</p>
<p>"Dodge!"</p>
<p>I reflexively jumped out of the way and swung my sword. I heard the sound of something</p>
<p>bouncing off a Ratman's blade. But I didn't manage to deflect them all.</p>
<p>"Ah."</p>
<p>When I looked around, Literary Girl 64 had a dagger stuck in her thigh.</p>
<p>I quickly supported her and stepped back.</p>
<p>Literary Girl 64's complexion immediately turned purple.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>—His agility level is over 20.</p>
<p>—Is there ever an apostle with two stats over 20?</p>
<p>—Maybe it's an apostle possessing a named.</p>
<p>—Is he from &lt;Kim Dokja's Company&gt;?</p>
<p>The Ratmen craned their necks and looked up into the air at the same time. Like terminals</p>
<p>waiting for a signal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>—Says no.</p>
<p>—Then let's get rid of him.</p>
<p>In that moment, I came up with a creepy hypothesis.</p>
<p>The Ratmen in front of me were not 'readers', but they knew information that only 'readers' could</p>
<p>know.</p>
<p>That means someone is feeding them information.</p>
<p>Maybe someone who could communicate with them in real time.</p>
<p>I reflexively looked up into the air.</p>
<p><&>「Did all of the 'Omniscient Reader' readers really only possess 'incarnations'?」</p>
<p>From across the pitch-black darkness, I felt a gaze upon me.</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Plague-Carrying Rat' looks down on you.]</p>
<p>I thought with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>Sooyoung-ah, isn't this a probability problem?</p>
<p>Author's Note</p>
<p>Hakhyun-ah, Sooyoung is also busy right now</p>
