            <div class="orv_title"><h1>686 Episode 23 Fragments of God (1)</h1></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' begins its storytelling!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A strong feeling of a foreign object in my head. In the place where my consciousness should be, there was something—a story—sitting there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was ordering me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I am the only one 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard the first syllable, I got goosebumps. Because I knew what kind of sentence it was.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 who knows the ending of this world 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The introduction of 『Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint』.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sentence I once wrote has now returned to me and become a curse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It has been done.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I am the only Kim Dokja 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The universe opened up before my eyes, and an image of dozens, hundreds, and thousands of meteors scattering all at once came to mind.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 If I can't be Kim Dokja 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I would rather Kim Dokja did not exist in this universe. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Whose wish is that? I didn't know where the sentence came from.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What is certain is that I never wrote it and there is no way Han Sooyoung wrote this sentence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fact that this story has this sentence probably means that this story also originates from 'Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw Lee Dansu approaching nearby.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is craving it.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 'thoughts' that were  in the shape of a bracelet soon changed into the damaged bamboo suit of Master Samyeong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The hand holding the bamboo pole was shaking.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' commands feasting.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I said, grabbing the wrist holding the bamboo pole with my other hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Shut up."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is glaring at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I declared that I would definitely become Kim Dokja. However, that meant that I would shoulder Kim Dokja's duty, not that I would listen to the unreasonable orders of the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe I, too, changed after meeting Kim Dokja, the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if the world grabs me and shakes me, I will not be swayed by this irrational story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I don't control the story, the story will control me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You are my story. Listen to me."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is laughing at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I bit my lip as I looked at the readers running towards me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This story was something I couldn't handle right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja's name was too heavy and the person I am now is too me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was weak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I."</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I swore. I made a promise to Han Sooyoung, who wrote the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am Kim Dokja.”</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' controls your right arm.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As if it couldn't hear me, my right arm began to gain magical power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story was controlling my right arm. I guess it’s planning to kill and take the readers with my right hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I warned you."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' frowns.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story says that if the successor of the eternal name does not eat another 'Kim Dokja', you will disappear.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I don't want to survive that way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I'd rather—</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, ahjussi! No! Ahjussi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung seemed to have an ominous premonition and clung to my waist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's okay."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I used [Incite] to change the 'damaged master’s bamboo pole' to 'Broken Faith'. The blade was activated with shining light.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is staring at you!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As if it was trying to control me, the sparks sparked by the story tightened my entire body. I resisted it with all my magical power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Okay, let's fight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Either you win or I win.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is astonished.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I held back my 'Broken Faith' and stabbed the knife straight into my stomach.</p>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in the distant pain, I did not lose consciousness. This is because if I let go of my consciousness, the story could control my body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did he harm himself?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Snowflakes are flying wild all over his body."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Please bring me a blood transfusion pack quickly!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A blood transfusion is not enough. Use this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s my story."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Voices were heard above the surface of my fragile consciousness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi! Inho-ssi! No, why did Inho-ssi become like this!"</p>
<p class="orv_line"> Okay?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Save him right now. If you can't save him, I'll kill you all."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of an explosion was heard intermittently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What's the matter? Suddenly—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Damn, an emergency scenario has begun!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh my god. Monsters—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There is not much power left here. The main focus of the seventh scenario is the United States."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then what should we do!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let’s go to Gwanghwamun."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But Inho-ssi—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Midday Tryst' has been restored.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">—Stand up, youngest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I opened my eyes, an excruciating pain came from my lower abdomen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I exhaled several times, enduring the feeling of my stomach turning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My mind slowly became clearer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt that the presence of the story that had been controlling me until a moment ago had disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A sense of liberation slowly bloomed in my heart.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your sponsor is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja's voice sounded as if he was dumbfounded in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Yoo Jonghyuk also doesn’t control the stories in that way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This was the only way."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only way to stop the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although it was a bit unconventional, it was the most powerful action I could take right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Considering that the story is quiet, it seems like it was successful anyway.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What about other readers?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">—They're safe. But did you really have to use that method? You could have just used [Incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Because it might not work."</p>
<p class="orv_line">—After thinking that far, you made a hole in your stomach?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Now I’m a little bit like Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">—What the hell.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja's voice sounded like he was having fun. I also smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I slowly looked around, it seemed like I had been admitted to a ward in a temporary shelter. As I pulled out the IV in my arm, my fingertips trembled ominously. It feels like it will break into pieces if someone touches me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The status of my being was shaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was this how 49% Kim Dokja felt?</p>
<p class="orv_line">A thumping sound echoed from afar. The sound of a building collapsing. People were screaming and moaning. I walked through the tent of my temporary shelter and looked outside.</p>
<p class="orv_line">People who had been practicing repeatedly until the end were scattered throughout Gwanghwamun along with all kinds of monsters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly gathered my thoughts and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What happened?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The scenario has begun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Almost immediately, a message log appeared in my mind.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A sub-scenario is currently in progress.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Sub Scenario — Monster Invasion&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Sub</p>
<p>Difficulty: A++</p>
<p>Clear conditions: The Balaur tribe, who have a deep grudge against humans, have invaded the Korean peninsula. Stop the invasion and protect your world.</p>
<p>Timeout: —</p>
<p>Reward: Lesser Dragon Heart, ???</p>
<p>Failure: —</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't the main scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's probably one of the derivative scenarios of the 'main scenario'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If it’s a dragon, what level is it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Minimum 5th grade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart sank.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because in the fourth scenario, the memory of almost dying when hunting a '5th grade Poisonous Dragon' came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the surprise quickly subsided.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that I think about it, it's the 'seventh scenario'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">During the time I was unconscious, my companions must have already faced 'catastrophe level' monsters several times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, the current group might be able to handle 5th grade or so.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—There is also a 4th grade one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"4th grade?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">4th grade was a monster I had never faced before. Even if we say that it is up to 5th grade, 4th grade is on a different level. But.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Where is Yoo Jonghyuk?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered Yoo Jonghyuk from the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A monster with more overwhelming force than in the 3rd round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyone who cleared all of the disaster scenarios while I was away would be able to deal with even a 4th grade species.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aaaah! Stop it!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Save me! Please help me!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aaaahhh!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter where I looked on the battlefield, I could not see Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That guy was forcibly summoned to the final field of the 'seventh scenario' a little while ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that I think about it, the hour I promised with Yoo Jonghyuk has already passed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately or unfortunately, the faces of the readers were not visible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi, Killer King, Ye Hyunwoo, and Kyung Sein.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk's colleagues, such as Lee Jihye, Lee Hyunsung, Kim Namwoon and Lee Seolhwa were also nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed like everyone had moved to the main scenario area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then the people left here—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Only selected incarnations can participate in the main event of the seventh scenario. Those people...</p>
<p class="orv_line">People who were not chosen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was that it wasn't just one or two.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aaaahhh!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Among them were some faces I recognized. For example, Bang Cheolsoo and the mother and daughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aaaah! Push on! If it continues like this, it will break through!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Dayoung! Stick this way!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sergeants Kim and Jung Eunho, who fought with me at Seoul Station, were also seen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There! There’s a hole over there!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’ll take care of it!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A pair of chopsticks thrown by Jung Eunho caused them to scream and fall down. Behind them, Shin Yoosoung was also seen summoning Nagak troops to cover the people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Fight! Keep fighting!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">They fell helpless before the fire of the Avatars.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there were more groups running after their own people. At the center of the group of monsters was a dragon that controlled the monster species.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You can’t let them go to the shelter! Stop them!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A woman stood in the center of the battlefield, confronting the dragon tribe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After possessing a character in this world, it was the first member of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; I encountered.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation 'Jung Heewon' activates 'Kendo Lv.10'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Every time Jung Heewon swung her sword, five or six cherubs died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I watched Jung Heewon's fight, even forgetting to breathe. Over the past 45 days, I could see how hard she had trained.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One step. The balance of the battlefield seemed to be shaken every time the magic power contained in one trajectory caused a ripple.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Krarar La La Lag!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The panicked 5th grade monster swung its tail and counterattacked, but Jung Heewon's momentum showed no signs of stopping.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In an instant, Jung Heewon climbed up the tail and struck with a sword strike.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A sword equipped with strong magical power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In less than five seconds, dozens of consecutive strikes pierced the 5th grade species' eyes and forehead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahhh!</p>
<p class="orv_line">As one 5th grade species fell with a roar, the expressions on the incarnations' faces changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They got brighter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It fell down!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We can win! We can win!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the morale of the incarnations rose, the monsters hesitated and cried out in fear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon ran toward the next dragon without hesitation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What stopped her advance sweeping the battlefield was a monster the size of a 10-story building.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[4th grade monster 'Earth Python'’is roaring!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Howling, all the incarnations in the area screamed and fell down at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even Jung Heewon stumbled, bleeding from her ears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Jung Heewon didn't sit down.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Madness]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A destructive glow flashed in her pupils. The unique characteristics of the 'Mad Butcher' were protecting her consciousness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Everybody wake up."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the sound of Jung Heewon's voice, people who had been rolling around on the floor stood up as if they were infected with madness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were all people who couldn't fight any longer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't understand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why don't you run away?</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is no penalty for failure in this 'sub-scenario'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That meant that they could let Gwanghwamun be destroyed without having to fight back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps Yoo Jonghyuk knew that too, so he left here without taking any action.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No way..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That's right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before I knew it, people were forming a circle around my temporary shelter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—They’re protecting you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked closely at the faces of all the remaining people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Geumho Station, Chungmuro, Seoul Station. Faces that I have passed by at least once somewhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey, Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A middle-aged man who spotted me exclaimed with joy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Everyone, look! The captain—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yes. With a sound, the man whose neck had been bitten by the monster fell down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim ahjussi!" A woman cried.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before I could say anything, a crowd of people rushed in and covered the two of us. I held 'Broken Faith' in my hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Let’s use [Incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Let’s incite me to call myself Yoo Jonghyuk. No, Jung Heewon, and Kim Dokja. Anyone is good.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anything is fine—</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This skill cannot be activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It felt like someone was hitting a gong in my head.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your incarnation body is currently unstable.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Achieve 'Kim Dokja’s dismissal' within 5 minutes.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[If the new 'Kim Dokja Fragment' cannot be acquired, you will die.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I was dying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe faster than them.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Time left until death: 4:49]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The flood of stories has subsided, but the penalty has not disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to save them, but I couldn't think of a way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I cannot do it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though the people protecting me are dying before my eyes, there is nothing I can do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">ㅡYoo Jonghyuk made you his colleague.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My constellation’s voice came to my ear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—And yet he left you behind. Why did he do that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly raised my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason Yoo Jonghyuk left me here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did he think I could solve this scenario?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja did not answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As my emotions slowly subsided, I could see the situation clearly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is no Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">People are dying.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Time left until death: 3:08]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I have 3 minutes left to live.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To activate a skill. I had to remove the penalty for this story first.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Only me 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A penalty that only disappears if I eat 'Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, there was only one way to tell this story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heir of the Eternal Name."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Giving Kim Dokja, the only person in this world who I can use as 'fodder' for my story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I raised my right arm to my mouth and ordered the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Eat 'me'."</p>
