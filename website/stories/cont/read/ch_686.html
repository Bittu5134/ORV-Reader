<p class="orv_line">A strong feeling of a foreign object in my head. In the place where my consciousness should be, there was something—a story—sitting there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was ordering me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I am the only one」</div>「I am the only one」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard the first syllable, I got goosebumps. Because I knew what kind of sentence it was.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「who knows the ending of this world」</div>「who knows the ending of this world」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The introduction of 『Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint』.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sentence I once wrote has now returned to me and become a curse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It has been done.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I am the only Kim Dokja」</div>「I am the only Kim Dokja」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The universe opened up before my eyes, and an image of dozens, hundreds, and thousands of meteors scattering all at once came to mind.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「If I can&#x27;t be Kim Dokja」</div>「If I can't be Kim Dokja」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I would rather Kim Dokja did not exist in this universe.」</div>「I would rather Kim Dokja did not exist in this universe.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Whose wish is that? I didn&#x27;t know where the sentence came from.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What is certain is that I never wrote it and there is no way Han Sooyoung wrote this sentence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fact that this story has this sentence probably means that this story also originates from &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw Lee Dansu approaching nearby.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;Heir of the Eternal Name&#x27; is craving it.]</div>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is craving it.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#x27;thoughts&#x27; that were  in the shape of a bracelet soon changed into the damaged bamboo suit of Master Samyeong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The hand holding the bamboo pole was shaking.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;Heir of the Eternal Name&#x27; commands feasting.]</div>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' commands feasting.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said, grabbing the wrist holding the bamboo pole with my other hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Shut up.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;Heir of the Eternal Name&#x27; is glaring at you.]</div>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is glaring at you.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I declared that I would definitely become Kim Dokja. However, that meant that I would shoulder Kim Dokja&#x27;s duty, not that I would listen to the unreasonable orders of the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ahjussi—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe I, too, changed after meeting Kim Dokja, the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if the world grabs me and shakes me, I will not be swayed by this irrational story.</p>

<p class="orv_line">I was weak.</p>

<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, ahjussi! No! Ahjussi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung seemed to have an ominous premonition and clung to my waist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s okay.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I used [Incite] to change the &#x27;damaged master’s bamboo pole&#x27; to &#x27;Broken Faith&#x27;. The blade was activated with shining light.</p>

<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in the distant pain, I did not lose consciousness. This is because if I let go of my consciousness, the story could control my body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did he harm himself?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Snowflakes are flying wild all over his body.&quot;</p>

<p class="orv_line">&quot;This—&quot;</p>

<p class="orv_line">Voices were heard above the surface of my fragile consciousness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi! Inho-ssi! No, why did Inho-ssi become like this!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line"> Okay?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Save him right now. If you can&#x27;t save him, I&#x27;ll kill you all.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of an explosion was heard intermittently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What&#x27;s the matter? Suddenly—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Damn, an emergency scenario has begun!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh my god. Monsters—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There is not much power left here. The main focus of the seventh scenario is the United States.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then what should we do!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let’s go to Gwanghwamun.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But Inho-ssi—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Midday Tryst&#x27; has been restored.]</div>['Midday Tryst' has been restored.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Stand up, youngest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I opened my eyes, an excruciating pain came from my lower abdomen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I exhaled several times, enduring the feeling of my stomach turning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My mind slowly became clearer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt that the presence of the story that had been controlling me until a moment ago had disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A sense of liberation slowly bloomed in my heart.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your sponsor is looking at you.]</div>[Your sponsor is looking at you.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja&#x27;s voice sounded as if he was dumbfounded in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Yoo Jonghyuk also doesn’t control the stories in that way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This was the only way.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only way to stop the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although it was a bit unconventional, it was the most powerful action I could take right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Considering that the story is quiet, it seems like it was successful anyway.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What about other readers?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—They&#x27;re safe. But did you really have to use that method? You could have just used [Incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because it might not work.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—After thinking that far, you made a hole in your stomach?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Now I’m a little bit like Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—What the hell.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja&#x27;s voice sounded like he was having fun. I also smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I slowly looked around, it seemed like I had been admitted to a ward in a temporary shelter. As I pulled out the IV in my arm, my fingertips trembled ominously. It feels like it will break into pieces if someone touches me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The status of my being was shaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was this how 49% Kim Dokja felt?</p>
<p class="orv_line">A thumping sound echoed from afar. The sound of a building collapsing. People were screaming and moaning. I walked through the tent of my temporary shelter and looked outside.</p>
<p class="orv_line">People who had been practicing repeatedly until the end were scattered throughout Gwanghwamun along with all kinds of monsters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly gathered my thoughts and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What happened?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The scenario has begun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Almost immediately, a message log appeared in my mind.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A sub-scenario is currently in progress.]</div>[A sub-scenario is currently in progress.]</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Sub Scenario — Monster Invasion&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Sub</p>
<p>Difficulty: A++</p>
<p>Clear conditions: The Balaur tribe, who have a deep grudge against humans, have invaded the Korean peninsula. Stop the invasion and protect your world.</p>
<p>Timeout: —</p>
<p>Reward: Lesser Dragon Heart, ???</p>
<p>Failure: —</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#x27;t the main scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s probably one of the derivative scenarios of the &#x27;main scenario&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If it’s a dragon, what level is it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Minimum 5th grade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart sank.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because in the fourth scenario, the memory of almost dying when hunting a &#x27;5th grade Poisonous Dragon&#x27; came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the surprise quickly subsided.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that I think about it, it&#x27;s the &#x27;seventh scenario&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">During the time I was unconscious, my companions must have already faced &#x27;catastrophe level&#x27; monsters several times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, the current group might be able to handle 5th grade or so.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—There is also a 4th grade one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;4th grade?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">4th grade was a monster I had never faced before. Even if we say that it is up to 5th grade, 4th grade is on a different level. But.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Where is Yoo Jonghyuk?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered Yoo Jonghyuk from the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A monster with more overwhelming force than in the 3rd round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyone who cleared all of the disaster scenarios while I was away would be able to deal with even a 4th grade species.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aaaah! Stop it!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Save me! Please help me!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aaaahhh!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter where I looked on the battlefield, I could not see Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That guy was forcibly summoned to the final field of the &#x27;seventh scenario&#x27; a little while ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that I think about it, the hour I promised with Yoo Jonghyuk has already passed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately or unfortunately, the faces of the readers were not visible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi, Killer King, Ye Hyunwoo, and Kyung Sein.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk&#x27;s colleagues, such as Lee Jihye, Lee Hyunsung, Kim Namwoon and Lee Seolhwa were also nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed like everyone had moved to the main scenario area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then the people left here—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Only selected incarnations can participate in the main event of the seventh scenario. Those people...</p>
<p class="orv_line">People who were not chosen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was that it wasn&#x27;t just one or two.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aaaahhh!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Among them were some faces I recognized. For example, Bang Cheolsoo and the mother and daughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aaaah! Push on! If it continues like this, it will break through!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Dayoung! Stick this way!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sergeants Kim and Jung Eunho, who fought with me at Seoul Station, were also seen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There! There’s a hole over there!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’ll take care of it!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A pair of chopsticks thrown by Jung Eunho caused them to scream and fall down. Behind them, Shin Yoosoung was also seen summoning Nagak troops to cover the people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Fight! Keep fighting!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">They fell helpless before the fire of the Avatars.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there were more groups running after their own people. At the center of the group of monsters was a dragon that controlled the monster species.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You can’t let them go to the shelter! Stop them!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A woman stood in the center of the battlefield, confronting the dragon tribe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After possessing a character in this world, it was the first member of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; I encountered.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation &#x27;Jung Heewon&#x27; activates &#x27;Kendo Lv.10&#x27;!]</div>[Incarnation 'Jung Heewon' activates 'Kendo Lv.10'!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Every time Jung Heewon swung her sword, five or six cherubs died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I watched Jung Heewon&#x27;s fight, even forgetting to breathe. Over the past 45 days, I could see how hard she had trained.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One step. The balance of the battlefield seemed to be shaken every time the magic power contained in one trajectory caused a ripple.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Krarar La La Lag!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The panicked 5th grade monster swung its tail and counterattacked, but Jung Heewon&#x27;s momentum showed no signs of stopping.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In an instant, Jung Heewon climbed up the tail and struck with a sword strike.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A sword equipped with strong magical power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In less than five seconds, dozens of consecutive strikes pierced the 5th grade species&#x27; eyes and forehead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahhh!</p>
<p class="orv_line">As one 5th grade species fell with a roar, the expressions on the incarnations&#x27; faces changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They got brighter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It fell down!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We can win! We can win!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the morale of the incarnations rose, the monsters hesitated and cried out in fear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon ran toward the next dragon without hesitation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What stopped her advance sweeping the battlefield was a monster the size of a 10-story building.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[4th grade monster &#x27;Earth Python&#x27;’is roaring!]</div>[4th grade monster 'Earth Python'’is roaring!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Howling, all the incarnations in the area screamed and fell down at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even Jung Heewon stumbled, bleeding from her ears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Jung Heewon didn&#x27;t sit down.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Madness]</div>[Madness]</p>
<p class="orv_line">A destructive glow flashed in her pupils. The unique characteristics of the &#x27;Mad Butcher&#x27; were protecting her consciousness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Everybody wake up.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the sound of Jung Heewon&#x27;s voice, people who had been rolling around on the floor stood up as if they were infected with madness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were all people who couldn&#x27;t fight any longer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#x27;t understand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why don&#x27;t you run away?</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is no penalty for failure in this &#x27;sub-scenario&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That meant that they could let Gwanghwamun be destroyed without having to fight back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps Yoo Jonghyuk knew that too, so he left here without taking any action.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No way...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before I knew it, people were forming a circle around my temporary shelter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—They’re protecting you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked closely at the faces of all the remaining people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Geumho Station, Chungmuro, Seoul Station. Faces that I have passed by at least once somewhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey, Inho-ssi!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A middle-aged man who spotted me exclaimed with joy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Everyone, look! The captain—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yes. With a sound, the man whose neck had been bitten by the monster fell down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim ahjussi!&quot; A woman cried.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before I could say anything, a crowd of people rushed in and covered the two of us. I held &#x27;Broken Faith&#x27; in my hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Let’s use [Incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Let’s incite me to call myself Yoo Jonghyuk. No, Jung Heewon, and Kim Dokja. Anyone is good.</p>

<p class="orv_line">I cannot do it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though the people protecting me are dying before my eyes, there is nothing I can do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">ㅡYoo Jonghyuk made you his colleague.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My constellation’s voice came to my ear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—And yet he left you behind. Why did he do that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly raised my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason Yoo Jonghyuk left me here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did he think I could solve this scenario?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja did not answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As my emotions slowly subsided, I could see the situation clearly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is no Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">People are dying.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Giving Kim Dokja, the only person in this world who I can use as &#x27;fodder&#x27; for my story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I raised my right arm to my mouth and ordered the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Eat &#x27;me&#x27;.&quot;</p>
