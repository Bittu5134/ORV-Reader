            <div class="orv_title"><h1>878 Episode 48 Avatar (1)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung sat in the office of the penthouse and looked out the window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The vast view of Gwanghwamun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After looking at the quiet ruins for a long time, Han Sooyoung suddenly took out her notebook as if she had remembered something and started writing a sentence.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 And so Han Sooyoung was finally facing the final scenario of the 1,863rd round. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">She bit her lip as if she didn't like that sentence at all and added another.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 But can we really call that the 'last'? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A sentence that seemed like an unnecessary detail.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was that sentence her own impression of facing the final scenario, or was it her regretful thoughts as a writer who had to end the story like this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though the long-awaited moment had arrived, what was this inexplicable feeling of emptiness?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung hesitated, closed her notebook, took a cigarette out of her bosom, and put it in her mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When she raised her head, the gigantic sphere that filled the sky of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; came into view at a glance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Seal of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As she looked at the sphere that looked like a broken period, it seemed as if the sphere was talking to her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asking if she had forgotten something important. Asking if it was too early to end the story here.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Are you reminiscing?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When she turned her gaze to where the voice had come from, she saw the wings of an archangel floating outside the window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since the 1,863rd &lt;Eden&gt; had already been destroyed, there was only one 'archangel' left in this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Jophiel."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The commander of the Red Cosmos—Archangel Jophiel.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What are you thinking about?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Just, various things."</p>
<p class="orv_line">When Han Sooyoung answered, Jophiel also looked up at the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A world where the stars had fallen and only ruins remained.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She had finally come here after going through that hellish scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The archangel who had witnessed all those years from the closest place spoke.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You did your best.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Yeah, I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung took out a cigarette from her bosom and lit it. Han Sooyoung let out a light sigh as she watched the smoke rising in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's just that something feels off."</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were things that came to mind when she looked at the half-broken seal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Scenario 95.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That day, the pale face that fell from the sky. The short memory of performing the scenario with him. The moment they sat on the rooftop railing and talked together. Fragments of conversation that passed by here and there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jophiel asked.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Are you thinking of 'Kim Dokja'?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"What nonsense are you talking about?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Why are you using 'Poker Face'?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill, 'Poker Face LV.???', is activated!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Poker Face is a skill used to avoid being caught in front of Lie Detection.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung pursed her lips and turned off the skill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's just a habit. Are archangels originally this interested in other people's business?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It had already been two years since Kim Dokja had appeared in this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy who appeared in this world like a comet had messed up this scenario on his own, freed the main character, and even released the Apocalypse before leaving.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "It's not over just because the Apocalypse was freed. You know that, right?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, thanks to the guy causing such chaos, Han Sooyoung was able to avoid making the wrong choice. She was able to live properly in this world.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[He would have returned to his own worldline.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"That's right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The world of Kim Dokja that had disappeared was not this one, and the guy had returned to where he should have been.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Leaving only the author behind in this world where the main character and the reader had left.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe that's why, Han Sooyoung thought quickly. What if she had held onto him a little longer then? Asked him to read her story a little longer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He must be eating well and living well there."</p>
<p class="orv_line">If she had told him to watch this world until the end.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I don’t know about that…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"No, he’ll forget all about this place and just goof around. That’s just the kind of guy he is."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The time she spent with Kim Dokja was really brief.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, whenever she looked up at the sky like she did now, Han Sooyoung kept thinking of that face that had been smiling subtly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man who loved novels more than anyone she knew. Was he still reading 'Ways of Survival'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will he remember her- the story of this world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Captain, preparations are complete.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When she heard a telegram from somewhere, she looked down and saw Lee Hyunsung and her colleagues waiting for her at the entrance of the headquarters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were the colleagues she had formed after falling here— the 1,863rd time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The delusional demon Kim Namwoon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sea admiral Lee Jihye.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Beast Lord Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The steel sword master Lee Hyunsung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The colleagues who had finally reached the limit of their growth potential. The proud characters of this worldline who will not easily kneel down no matter what constellation they face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung waved her hand lightly toward them and muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You all worked hard."</p>
<p class="orv_line">She thought she muttered so quietly that it was inaudible, but Kim Namwoon, who was looking up at her, shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you talking about, Captain! Why are you already making that face that it's all over?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There's still the last scenario left!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung snickered as she listened to Lee Hyunsung's loud voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's right. Their enemies still remained across the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Enemies that were preventing them from passing through the gate of the 'last scenario'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm telling you in advance, kids."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As she said that, she realized that a lot had happened in the meantime.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now, if she just took one more step, if she just wrote one more sentence, the last phase of this world would end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But why was it so hard to take that one step, to write that one sentence?</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, Kim Namwoon, who was looking up at her, said something strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh? Captain, the movement of the Apocalypse Dragon is a bit strange."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung raised her head, feeling as if it couldn't be true.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kugugugu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Seal of Apocalypse' that was destroyed in the air was causing an abnormal reaction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What, wasn't that kid asleep?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">After the problematic scenario 95 ended, Han Sooyoung used a special method to make the revived Apocalypse Dragon fall 'dormant' again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the Apocalypse Dragon that was clearly asleep was moving again.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[No way.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even Archangel Jophiel looked flustered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung, with a hardened expression, activated [Predictive Plagiarism]. And.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's not awake. It's just like a sleepwalker."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Sleepwalker?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"It's a bit strange for a sleepwalker, but... What the hell."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment she confirmed the tail wriggling inside the sealed sphere, Han Sooyoung shouted at her colleagues.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Everyone, hide behind cover!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A shockwave from the Apocalypse soared into the sky with a tremendous air current. An ear-piercing explosion. A dust storm swept over the headquarters. The coughing sounds of the incarnations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A moment later, when the dust cleared, someone pointed to the sky and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Something's falling over there!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A star was falling in the distant sky.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">When I opened my eyes in the darkness, the first thing that hit me was excruciating pain. It felt as if Yoo Joonghyuk had beaten my whole body with [Hundred Steps Godly Fists]. However, since Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't have beaten me, this was probably just the aftereffects of the worldline shift.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Worldline shift. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Naturally, past events flowed through my mind like a panorama.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first thing that came to mind was what happened in the 'Fear Realm'. It was.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The destruction of the 'Fear Realm' has begun. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The time fault where the Apocalypse Dragon was sleeping has opened. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 To prevent destruction, I personally closed the door to the 'Time Fault'. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 In the process, I crossed over the door to the 'Time Fault'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And this is what happened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My head was throbbing and I had a headache. There were more than one or two things to check.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Did the 'King of Fear' safely enter the [Fourth Wall]? 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 What is the possibility of the 'super-giant tale' that I obtained? 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 What power did I gain by becoming a Recorder of Fear? 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Did Yoo Joonghyuk and Anna Croft safely return to the scenario? 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Are my party, including Killer King and Ji Eunyu, okay? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Where on earth am I right now? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I had a guess about the last question. It was because the scenery I saw just before I fainted was still vivid in my mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, The problem is.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 My hands and feet won't listen to me. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At first, I thought it was because of muscle pain. However, as I gradually regained my senses, I realized that wasn't the case.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't activate [Skills] or [Stigmata].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Right now, I was restrained by a special tool.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Story Metal. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I saw my hands and feet tied to the bed, I suddenly got scared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Where am I?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why am I tied up?</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the midst of all this, there was a long tube connected to the story vein on the back of my hand, as if it was a consideration to keep me from dying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't move. The story hasn't stabilized yet."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A pure white woman's face appeared in the darkness. I recognized her at a glance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Lee Seolhwa-ssi?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the atmosphere was strangely different from the 'Lee Seolhwa' I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Seolhwa looked down at me with troubled eyes. She seemed to want to say something, but a voice from behind stopped her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Okay, just go out."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, Captain."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Lee Seolhwa disappeared outside, a deep silence descended on the room. It was not easy to endure the silence while tied up on the bed, so I carefully opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Excuse me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then I felt someone approaching me from the darkness. Under the sound of light footsteps and the soft light, a face I knew well was looking down at me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Han Sooyoung. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I saw her face, my heart ached. Various memories were boiling in my head. Whether or not she knew my feelings, Han Sooyoung opened her mouth in a calm voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if my answer was not very good. Han Sooyoung glared at me for a moment and then suddenly asked a strange question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You came back?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"...?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hmm. Judging by your dazzling eyes, isn't it 'that guy'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">My mind became complicated for a moment.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 This world line was the '1,863rd' of the 'Ways of Survival'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And the Han Sooyoung in front of me was definitely 'that Han Sooyoung'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung who had received 'half of the memories' from the main body, Han Sooyoung who had come over to the 1,863rd in accordance with the contract with 'Secretive Plotter'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung who had tried to seal Yoo Joonghyuk forever in the 1,863rd round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What on earth are you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">That Han Sooyoung was asking about my identity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How did I get here, but I had no idea what to say about myself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took a deep breath and muttered to myself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Constellation-nim.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this situation, it would probably be best to borrow Kim Dokja's mouth. Kim Dokja had already met this Han Sooyoung, so he would know what to say in this situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He must be there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what is it? No matter how long I waited, there was no reply from the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What is it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I looked back, the coat I was wearing had also been taken off. When I turned my head, I saw my coat hanging about ten steps away. However, my hands and feet were tied, so there was no way to check inside the coat pocket.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you looking for this?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">My smartphone was in Han Sooyoung's fingertips.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth without realizing it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Please give it back."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung laughed as if she found me funny.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you know how useless a 'smartphone' is in this world?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's definitely true.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Right after the 'scenarios' opened, the 'smartphone' was no longer 'smart'. This is because various skills could sufficiently replace the role of a 'smartphone'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is there something precious in it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Listening to that vague voice, I thought that maybe Han Sooyoung in front of me already knew a lot.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But even if that was true, I didn't know how to bring it up to her.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Han Sooyoung of the 1,863rd round was one of the most important characters in this entire world. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What if I brought it up wrong and the world line got messed up again?</p>
<p class="orv_line">After thinking about it for a moment, I said,</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There's a novel I like in there."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What novel? It's not 'Ways of Survival', is it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung nodded her head, how she had interpreted my silence unknown.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He looks and speaks like that guy, but he's not that guy. But he likes the same novel as that guy... That's interesting."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that short moment, Han Sooyoung seemed to have finished her insight into the human being called 'me'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe I had overlooked her. If you think about it, she was the one who knew who Kim Dokja was and where he came from just by reading the 'Sacred Three Questions'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I slowly raised my head in a cool mood, Han Sooyoung smiled and opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You, are you Kim Dokja's [Avatar]?"</p>
