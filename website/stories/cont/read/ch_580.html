<p class="orv_line">7942? What&#x27;s that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;7942.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man said it again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if it was some sort of reader-defined code word.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I should answer correctly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Between friends!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi suddenly exclaimed. He spoke with the speed of a scholarship quiz.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He turned to me and muttered in a half-whisper.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;My mate doesn&#x27;t know, but that means &#x27;between friends&#x27; this days. It sounds like he&#x27;s happy to</p>
<p class="orv_line">see you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">But no matter how I looked at it, those were not friendly eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The thorn in the man&#x27;s hand slowly pointed at Dansoo ahjussi. The man&#x27;s expression turned cold,</p>
<p class="orv_line">and a breathless confrontation ensued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;9158!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein shouted fitfully.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The thorn stopped in midair.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;re a member of the Seven Apostles, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein&#x27;s expression was somehow flushed as she said that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man who retracted the thorn asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After using &#x27;Readers&#x27; Comments List&#x27; a few times, I slowly realized the generation pattern of the</p>
<p class="orv_line">readers&#x27; ID.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, Dansoo ahjussi&#x27;s ID, wldbsdldkQk80, when converted to English based on a</p>
<p class="orv_line">QWERTY keyboard, looks like this</p>
<p class="orv_line">wldbsdldkQk80</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">=Jiyoon&#x27;s dad 80</p>
<p class="orv_line">We can convert alsdn0905, Kyung Sein&#x27;s ID, similarly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">alsdn0905</p>
<p class="orv_line">=Minwoo0905 (presumably his real name).</p>
<p class="orv_line">Both of them were perfect if they wanted their personal information to be leaked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the two new people I met were different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">First, there was this guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">killer_king [1]</p>
<p class="orv_line">=killer_king</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King. Aside from the fact that it&#x27;s a combination of two cool words, it&#x27;s a pretty</p>
<p class="orv_line">uninformative ID.</p>
<p class="orv_line">On the other hand, the woman over there lighting the &#x27;Magic Power Stove&#x27; was a little different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">ansgkrthsu64.</p>
<p class="orv_line">=LiteraryGirl64</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t recognize her nickname, but it was clear that she was a book lover.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Literary Girl 64 placed the freshly caught ground rat meat on the Magic Power Stove and began</p>
<p class="orv_line">roasting it with medicine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sit down for now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King commanded us confidently, then sat down himself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He hesitated a moment, then added some words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I guess it doesn&#x27;t matter if I speak informally. This isn&#x27;t &#x27;real life&#x27; anyway.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is real too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, this is a &#x27;new world&#x27; dominated by &#x27;new laws&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If that is the mindset of a reader who has read Omniscient Reader 99.8 times, I can only respect</p>
<p class="orv_line">it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi didn&#x27;t seem to disagree.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We are all adults.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are all three of you readers?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, as you can see.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How do you know the password of the Apostles?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Seven Apostles. I had heard the name of the community from Kyung Sein before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She replied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I was a member of the community, though I was rarely active.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Nickname?&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Judge Heewon.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a moment of thought, Killer King asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you the guy who used to post pictures of his abs on the message boards all the time?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah! You remember.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;d be strange if I didn&#x27;t remember. You&#x27;ve been doing the same thing every day for two years.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Haha, yeah, I did.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s a shame you don&#x27;t have abs to show off.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein looked down at her tiny body and chuckled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Still, it&#x27;s fun to start anew. And here, you just level up your stats and your body improves on its</p>
<p class="orv_line">own.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s a convenient world.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Now I&#x27;d like to hear about you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m Killer King.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein&#x27;s mouth dropped open.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Killer King? Are you really the Killer King?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King nodded, and Kyung Sein shuddered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked in a whisper.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is he a famous?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Of course he is. There&#x27;s no one who doesn&#x27;t know his nickname.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know, but that Killer King seemed to be very important in that world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Killer King-nim is the Second Apostle of the Seven Apostles.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since they were the Seven Apostles, it must have a total of seven leaders.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This means that the Killer King in front of me is the second of them.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wait. So there&#x27;s someone who&#x27;s read more than him?</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if reading my mind, Kyung Sein whispered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Rumor has it that the First Apostle has read Omniscient Reader over 100 times.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King, who had overheard the conversation, stepped in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s not &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27;, it&#x27;s the &#x27;Book of Revelation&#x27;. I see you&#x27;ve already forgotten the rules</p>
<p class="orv_line">of the Seven Apostles.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, yes, I did. I&#x27;m sorry.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And I was about to reach the 100 readings myself.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Stop talking about pathetic things and eat.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Everyone turned around at the sound of her voice. Literary Girl 64, who had been silent for a</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">long time, opened her mouth for the first time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps because of the sudden attention, Literary Girl 64 lowered her head blushing and looked</p>
<p class="orv_line">down at the stove.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein asked Killer King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is she also an &#x27;Apostle&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King picked up a skewer of ground rat and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;She&#x27;s just my younger sibling.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah, so your sister has read the Book of Revelation.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, I haven&#x27;t.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What? And yet you ended up in Omniscient Reader?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that, Literary Girl 64 glared at Killer King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King coughed lightly and replied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I told her about the Book of Revelation a few times.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How many times?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;......Quite a few times.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I understood the meaning of (12.8 times) in Literary Girl 64&#x27;s information list.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She shook her head as if she was bored, and handed us each a skewer of ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I was about to take the skewer, Literature Girl 64 glanced in my direction. When I looked</p>
<p class="orv_line">back at her, she bowed her head and mumbled something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wasn&#x27;t sure, but she seemed to be thanking me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I think she was thanking me for telling her the attack pattern earlier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">She just smiled and handed me the skewer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#x27;m touched. This is completely normal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was painful to think that the one who didn&#x27;t read Omniscient Reader was the most normal.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Prisoner of the Golden Headband&#x27; smacks his lips.]</div>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' smacks his lips.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Sneaking Schemer&#x27; gulps down his saliva.]</div>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' gulps down his saliva.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was really hungry, and the sight of the golden brown meat in front of me was hard to resist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;May I eat it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thanks for the meal.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We started tearing into the meat without anyone stopping us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When you&#x27;re eating something really good, there&#x27;s a natural silence. No one said a word, but we</p>
<p class="orv_line">were all thinking the same thing.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">「This is really good.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The meat that existed only in text has become real. The seasoning that the younger sibling made</p>
<p class="orv_line">was just right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ha, it&#x27;s really good.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;re very skillful.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only after barely tearing off one leg piece by piece did Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi express</p>
<p class="orv_line">their admiration at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Literary Girl 64 smiled silently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King also shook his head as if the meat wasn&#x27;t bad.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Killer King-nim. I&#x27;m actually a real fan of yours. I also remember the comment war you had</p>
<p class="orv_line">with the members of the Misreading Association for three days and four nights.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You remember that useless stuff.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Seriously, I can&#x27;t tell you how lucky I am to see you here. I&#x27;ve almost died several times, but</p>
<p class="orv_line">you&#x27;ve read the Book of Revelation 99 ti—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Almost 100 times.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I never thought I&#x27;d meet the Killer King who read it almost 100 times.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why are you glad you met me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What? It&#x27;s you we&#x27;re talking about.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I could be a bad guy.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein&#x27;s eyes widened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#x27;t say that. No one who has read the Book of Revelation all the way through is a bad</p>
<p class="orv_line">person.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was speechless for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even more surprising was Killer King&#x27;s response.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Not everyone who reads it is a good human being.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He said so seriously, immersed in a strange sense of sorrow. It would have been a bit cool if his</p>
<p class="orv_line">name wasn&#x27;t Killer King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein was speechless, while Dansoo ahjussi looked lethargic, perhaps because he was full.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since no one else spoke up, I had to point it out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;By the way, your way of speaking is strangely similar to someone&#x27;s.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You must like Yoo Joonghyuk.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Literary Girl 64, who was next to me, made a raspy, windy sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King looked at me and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You hardly ate the meat.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m a slow eater.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What&#x27;s your nickname?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, he&#x27;s not an Apostle. He doesn&#x27;t join any comms.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King&#x27;s eyes narrowed at Kyung Sein&#x27;s comment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How many times have you read the Book of Revelation?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#x27;t remember, but I must have read it more than 10 times.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Someone has used &#x27;Lie Detection&#x27;.]</div>[Someone has used 'Lie Detection'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wow, he already had [Lie Detection]?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The other person has confirmed that the statement is true.]</div>[The other person has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I&#x27;ve read it 100 times it&#x27;s also more than 10 times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I see. You&#x27;ll be an intermediate apostle by 10 times.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was surprised to see Killer King looking at me in pure amazement.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t realize there were grades for apostles.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m flattered.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How did you know about the last pattern of the &#x27;Dark Keeper&#x27;? That doesn&#x27;t even appear in the</p>
<p class="orv_line">Book of Revelation.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It just came to me.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The other person has confirmed that the statement is true.]</div>[The other person has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King had a questioning look on his face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You must have a foresight skill.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, I do have the ability to find out hidden information.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I have notes that only I know about, so this wasn&#x27;t a lie.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The other person has confirmed that the statement is true.]</div>[The other person has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King nodded and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Interesting.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A moment of silence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I spit the bite of skewer I&#x27;d taken on the floor and stood up slowly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m not that interesting.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, Dansoo ahjussi and Kyung Sein fell sideways.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glared at the two people in front of me, holding the spike in my right hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King held the spike like me, ready for battle. And beside him, I could see Literary Girl 64,</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">her head down. Killer King said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They&#x27;re not dead, just asleep.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it&#x27;s a sleeping potion you can get early on, it&#x27;s probably the stem of yanaspleta.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know how they got it, but they were prepared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why did you do this?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I have two reasons.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killeer King looked at the &#x27;Dark Keeper&#x27; fallen on the distance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;One. You were going to attack us.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We weren&#x27;t.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Two. I smell blood on you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s because we caught a lot of ground rats.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The smell of human blood.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I paused for the first time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Even if you know the contents of the Book of Revelation, you are, at your core, an ordinary</p>
<p class="orv_line">human being. Few humans can kill their own kind without hesitation because they&#x27;re suddenly in</p>
<p class="orv_line">a novel.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;True, but if you want to protect yourself, you have to fight.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The average reader has a pattern. If you&#x27;ve been lucky enough to find a bug and kill it, you</p>
<p class="orv_line">wouldn&#x27;t have killed anyone yet, but if you had to kill someone, you would have killed one. But.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Upon closer inspection, one of Killer King&#x27;s eyes shined in an unnerving dark red color.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew what that skill was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You have killed at least ten human beings.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is the stigma of an archangel who can read the sins of others.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Anything else to say? Murderer.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seems that &#x27;Killer King&#x27;&#x27;s sponsor is &#x27;Archangel Jophiel&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Author&#x27;s Note</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thank you.</p>
