<p class="orv_line">t was not simply an incarnation of a constellation with increased synchronization. That was truly the &#x27;incarnation body&#x27; of the Constellation himself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why is there a guy like that in a place like this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The nightmare of Washington East emerged again. Memories of being chased by the constellations along with the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I came all the way here to avoid them, but I met a constellation here too.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Now that I think about it, since when have stories been able to express their opinions to me?</p>

<p class="orv_line">Right. Whoever my opponent was, I also didn&#x27;t have a very easy story to tell.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Above all, my sponsor is the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I observed the incarnation of the constellation while taking deep, light breaths, the composition of the story that made up the incarnation caught my eye.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive attribute effect activates!]</div>[Exclusive attribute effect activates!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now, I guess my sense of vision has improved, and I was able to read fragments of the other person&#x27;s story just by paying attention.</p>

<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fragments of old and sick stories are visible.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story that makes up this incarnation has been greatly worn.]</div>[The story that makes up this incarnation has been greatly worn.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja said:</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is no scenario that cannot be conquered.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[During the event scenario, &#x27;wolves&#x27; are not killed by other animals.]</div>[During the event scenario, 'wolves' are not killed by other animals.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was reminded of Kim Dokja&#x27;s &#x27;Revolutionary Scenario&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, the &#x27;wolf&#x27; now had the same role as the executioner of the demon world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A position that enters a kind of &#x27;invincible state&#x27; during the time when the scenario occurs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this scenario were the same, there was also a way to somehow endure the &#x27;night&#x27; phase of the wolf and then aim for &#x27;day&#x27; when its weaknesses were exposed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If only it weren&#x27;t a constellation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Young wolf. Do you want to die?]</div>[Young wolf. Do you want to die?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the constellation&#x27;s voice, Killer King was taken aback and took a step back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it is a weakened constellation, there is an indescribable difference in rank from a normal incarnation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King probably also knew that fact. That&#x27;s why he probably chose to survive by protecting his companions instead of attacking the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unlike during the Demon World, there are not even &#x27;revolutionaries&#x27; in this scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is no way to kill that &#x27;wolf&#x27;, day or night.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King came to that conclusion.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The incarnation can only be killed through the rules of the &#x27;Event Scenario&#x27;.]</div>[The incarnation can only be killed through the rules of the 'Event Scenario'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">In my head, I remembered the contents of &#x27;The Three Little Pigs&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to the story, a &#x27;brick house&#x27; is needed to deal with the &#x27;wolf&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there are no &#x27;bricks&#x27; in this worldview.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[If you had chosen &#x27;Wolf&#x27;, you would have known. Weak animals are eaten. It is neither sad nor painful.

<p class="orv_line">&quot;I gave the hippopotamus&#x27;s front leg.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I won’t say it twice. Offer one of the &#x27;livestock&#x27; you raise. Then, I will leave obediently today.]</div>[I won’t say it twice. Offer one of the 'livestock' you raise. Then, I will leave obediently today.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, Killer King showed his teeth. Before we knew it, Killer King, who had taken out his bowgun, took a step back and aimed at the wolves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe there’s another way to just kill you all here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The leading wolves frowned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this &#x27;event scenario&#x27;, the wolf is not killed by &#x27;other animals&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That meant that they could be killed by  other wolves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if there was a constellation over there, if Killer King had his heart set on it, there was no way he wouldn&#x27;t be able to catch a wolf or two.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Kim Dokja. It&#x27;ll be there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King’s [telepathic sound] was heard in my ears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">— Run away with your companions. Since you have packed your luggage in advance, you can leave through the back door.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King smiled as he caught a glimpse of where I was hiding.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Don’t worry about me. I won&#x27;t die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Actually, I don&#x27;t think Killer King is very similar to Yoo Jonghyuk. It is the same as Kim Dokja, who constantly shouted, &quot;I am Yoo Jonghyuk,&quot; and cannot become Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason I&#x27;m shaking now is probably because I read &#x27;Ways of Survival&#x27; right before I came here.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;I will not die.&quot;」</div>「"I will not die."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s what Yoo Jonghyuk of &#x27;Ways of Survival&#x27; always said right before he died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I won&#x27;t die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk always left those words behind when he died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To Yoo Jonghyuk himself, those words must have been true. Because he is a regressor who never dies.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But are those words true for those left behind after his death?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Kill him.]</div>[Kill him.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time as the constellation gave an order, three wolves rushed towards Killer King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In an instant, the wolf&#x27;s claws rushed in, aiming at Killer King&#x27;s front, back, left and right sides.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story fragment &#x27;Heir of the Black Coat&#x27; begins its storytelling!]</div>[The story fragment 'Heir of the Black Coat' begins its storytelling!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">When did he collect such story fragments?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King&#x27;s brilliant coat fluttering gesture made his claws snap off cleanly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A fierce lion&#x27;s roar erupted from the corner of Killer King&#x27;s mouth with a heartless smile.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Fragment of the story &#x27;A person who resembles the voice of the Supreme King&#x27; shouts loudly!]</div>[Fragment of the story 'A person who resembles the voice of the Supreme King' shouts loudly!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought he might be able to imitate regression, but of course I didn&#x27;t have the courage to test that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King, who was hit on the back of the head, gritted his teeth and let out a loud noise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Kim Dokja! hurry!</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is actions, not words, that determine a person&#x27;s essence. Sincere actions remain as stories, and they are talked about and become stories.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;The Lone Savior&#x27; begins its storytelling.]</div>[The story 'The Lone Savior' begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The legend accumulated by Killer King was shining brightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is not the same as Yoo Jonghyuk&#x27;s, but it is no less noble.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That narrative dominated Killer King. It was leading him to his death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you leave him like that, he will die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If we leave him like this, Killer King will die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just like Sergeant Jung Moonho in Seoul Station and Jung Jaewoo in the Theater Dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yoo Jonghyuk. Let me ask you a favor.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ask?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk looked up at me. Facing his suspicious eyes, I searched for items in the &#x27;Dokkaebi Bag&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This worldview is a place where the use of &#x27;skills&#x27; and &#x27;stigmata&#x27; is prohibited. The effect of the item is also halved and it cannot perform as well as it should.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, no matter what I buy from the &#x27;Dokkaebi Bag&#x27;, there is no way to kill that &#x27;Wolf Constellation&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, it may be possible if it takes some time.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[1,000 coins were consumed in the &#x27;Dokkaebi Bag&#x27;.]</div>[1,000 coins were consumed in the 'Dokkaebi Bag'.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The item &#x27;Red Riding Hood (Replica)&#x27; has been acquired.]</div>[The item 'Red Riding Hood (Replica)' has been acquired.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I placed the items purchased through the &#x27;Dokkaebi Bag&#x27; on little Yoo Jonghyuk’s head.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The item&#x27;s effect increases the target&#x27;s attention!]</div>[The item's effect increases the target's attention!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk was startled and struggled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The effect of this item is simple.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The wearer becomes a little cuter, more appetizing, and attracts attention.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although the effect of the item is halved here, this should be enough for now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you doing—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment little Yoo Jonghyuk, who had barely peeked his head out of the hood, stood up, the gaze of the wolf constellation turned towards him.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;The Wolf Who Loves Little Red Riding Hood&#x27; finds prey!]</div>[The constellation 'The Wolf Who Loves Little Red Riding Hood' finds prey!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">If that wolf was a normal constellation, it wouldn&#x27;t have fallen into this trap.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was something different about him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was confident because I had already met several other constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An unstable status for a constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story contained in its incarnation was unbalanced, and its &#x27;character&#x27; was not perfect.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A rag-like incarnation made up of old story fragments that have not been properly repaired for a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Crucially, &#x27;The Three Little Pigs&#x27; was not the only story that constituted the incarnation of the wolf.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;The Wolf Who Covets Little Red Riding Hood&#x27; begins its storytelling.]</div>[The story 'The Wolf Who Covets Little Red Riding Hood' begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Constellations that have lived for a long time have difficulty distinguishing between their own will and the will of the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the story began its storytelling, the instinct of the guy who had been consumed by the story awakened.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Little Red Riding Hood.]</div>[Little Red Riding Hood.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Its bright red, bloodshot eyes began to shine, and it started running toward little Yoo Jonghyuk, wagging its tail like a mad dog.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded solemnly towards little Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let’s run.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you don’t run fast, you will die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk gritted his teeth and looked back at me and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will definitely kill you, Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Almost at the same time, I ducked for cover.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With the fierce wind blowing, Yoo Jonghyuk and the new form of the wolf constellation disappeared at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Coo coo coo coo coo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I looked up outside the cover, I saw little Yoo Jonghyuk running away and a wolf constellation chasing after him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a dangerous sight, as if he was about to be caught, but Yoo Jonghyuk will be fine. I don&#x27;t know if the guy&#x27;s stamina was as low as before, but Yoo Jonghyuk&#x27;s stamina had recovered quite a bit now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw him sitting on my shoulder, secretly taking out an elixir from his pocket, and consuming it with my own eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He eats eight meals a day, so he should have fully recovered by now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s not all.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The effect of the item &#x27;White Rat Mask&#x27; is activated!]</div>[The effect of the item 'White Rat Mask' is activated!]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Animal Mask&#x27; does not receive the &#x27;performance reduction effect&#x27; of the corresponding world view.]</div>['Animal Mask' does not receive the 'performance reduction effect' of the corresponding world view.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it because it is a &#x27;zodiac&#x27; worldview?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Mask&#x27; is the only item here that maintains its original performance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the effect of &#x27;Rat Mask&#x27;, which won first place in the &#x27;Zodiac Race&#x27;, is that there will be no chance of getting caught for a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You guys.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Meanwhile, Killer King, who had defeated all the other wolves, turned to look at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Indeed, the second apostle is Killer King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it possible to subdue a wolf that is not a constellation without using skills or stigmata?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King wiped away his bloody nose and said, glaring in this direction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you know what you did?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The southern part of Zone 13 is the territory of the &#x27;wolves&#x27;. Now you—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I am the enemy of the wolves.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King looked at me as if he was dumbfounded and muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Have you really become Kim Dokja?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We started collecting items and story fragments from the fallen wolves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some of the story fragments were useful and some were trash.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not all stories are recycled when they enter the &#x27;Recycling Center&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s not too late. If you’re going to leave, now is your only chance.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King, who was picking up items, stood up and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Go to another zodiac area. You haven’t lost your mask yet, so there must be a way to escape. I will take care of the rest of the group somehow.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t like it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Dokja.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first glance, a scar was revealed on the back of Killer King&#x27;s hand. It was a wound that had never appeared before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is only the eighth scenario. Do you know how many of the characters we know died on the way to here?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You don’t necessarily need everyone to see the ending.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">What Killer King said was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not all characters are needed for the ending of this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I and my companions have now accepted it. This world is not the &#x27;Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint&#x27; we used to know.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">No one knows how many more people will die on the journey to the end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some people will live and some people will die. Some will be forgotten and others will be remembered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I also know Killer King knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This story will not end with a beautiful ending like a fairy tale.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I need you to get the ending I want.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s typical of Kim Dokja to be unreasonable. Are you really going to take on that role? I’m sure you know what that means.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quietly looked into Killer King’s eyes. Now I had no choice but to admit it. That person really read &#x27;Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint&#x27; a hundred times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He really knows what I&#x27;m thinking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth, feeling inexplicably comforted by that fact.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Even though you know that—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You seem to be mistaken, but the reason you are needed is because you are so useful.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter what I do, I cannot become &#x27;Kim Dokja, the Demon King of Salvation&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as Killer King cannot become &#x27;Supreme King Yoo Jonghyuk&#x27; no matter what he does.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King looked at me with blank eyes for a moment, then smiled brightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I see. Somebody needs help…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King&#x27;s eyebrows twitched.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is there some kind of solution? As of now, even if you and I work together, we can’t catch that wolf.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;In theory, yes. But isn’t there something strange about this scenario?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Strange?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The name is &#x27;The Three Little Pigs&#x27;, but the structure of the scenario is very similar to a scenario we know. The wolf’s position and, of course, the fact that the scenario begins at &#x27;night&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A game to catch a &#x27;werewolf&#x27; that kills people by biting them every night.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We already know a ‘scenario’ that is very similar to that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Have you ever wondered why this center is called &#x27;Recycling Center&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Recycle. It literally means to reuse something that has been used. Killer King, who was thinking about something in response to my question, took a deep breath and muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No way…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know who the director of this &#x27;Recycling Center&#x27; is or for what purpose this stage was designed. But.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If what I think is right…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swept the dirt off the floor and gauged the flow of the surrounding stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since when did it start?</p>
<p class="orv_line">One by one, the group approached behindKiller King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, Dansu ahjussi, Ye Hyunwoo. And even Cha Yerin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought as I looked at them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only the eighth scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Killer King said, many readers have died. Readers died again and again, as if the world was hostile to them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We are the people in the world who can tell this story better than anyone else.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27; still did not die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let’s start the &#x27;Revolutionary Game&#x27; now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">From now on, it is Kim Dokja’s time.</p>
