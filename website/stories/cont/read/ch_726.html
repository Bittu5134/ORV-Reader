<p class="orv_line">t was not simply an incarnation of a constellation with increased synchronization. That was truly the 'incarnation body' of the Constellation himself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why is there a guy like that in a place like this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The nightmare of Washington East emerged again. Memories of being chased by the constellations along with the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I came all the way here to avoid them, but I met a constellation here too.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' looks at you pitifully.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">No. Now is not the time to feel intimidated.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Recorder of Things That Will Disappear' tells you to come to your senses.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Now that I think about it, since when have stories been able to express their opinions to me?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Tenacious Martial Arts Expert' says that anything can be done as long as you are persistent.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Right. Whoever my opponent was, I also didn't have a very easy story to tell.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Above all, my sponsor is the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I observed the incarnation of the constellation while taking deep, light breaths, the composition of the story that made up the incarnation caught my eye.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive attribute effect activates!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Now, I guess my sense of vision has improved, and I was able to read fragments of the other person's story just by paying attention.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I like Little Red Riding Hood」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Good at collecting wind」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I hate brick houses」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fragments of old and sick stories are visible.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story that makes up this incarnation has been greatly worn.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja said:</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is no scenario that cannot be conquered.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[During the event scenario, 'wolves' are not killed by other animals.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I was reminded of Kim Dokja's 'Revolutionary Scenario'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, the 'wolf' now had the same role as the executioner of the demon world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A position that enters a kind of 'invincible state' during the time when the scenario occurs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this scenario were the same, there was also a way to somehow endure the 'night' phase of the wolf and then aim for 'day' when its weaknesses were exposed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If only it weren't a constellation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Young wolf. Do you want to die?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the constellation's voice, Killer King was taken aback and took a step back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it is a weakened constellation, there is an indescribable difference in rank from a normal incarnation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King probably also knew that fact. That's why he probably chose to survive by protecting his companions instead of attacking the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unlike during the Demon World, there are not even 'revolutionaries' in this scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is no way to kill that 'wolf', day or night.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King came to that conclusion.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The incarnation can only be killed through the rules of the 'Event Scenario'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In my head, I remembered the contents of 'The Three Little Pigs'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to the story, a 'brick house' is needed to deal with the 'wolf'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there are no 'bricks' in this worldview.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[If you had chosen 'Wolf', you would have known. Weak animals are eaten. It is neither sad nor painful. It's just the providence of the story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I gave the hippopotamus's front leg."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I won’t say it twice. Offer one of the 'livestock' you raise. Then, I will leave obediently today.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, Killer King showed his teeth. Before we knew it, Killer King, who had taken out his bowgun, took a step back and aimed at the wolves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Maybe there’s another way to just kill you all here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The leading wolves frowned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this 'event scenario', the wolf is not killed by 'other animals'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That meant that they could be killed by  other wolves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if there was a constellation over there, if Killer King had his heart set on it, there was no way he wouldn't be able to catch a wolf or two.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Kim Dokja. It'll be there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King’s [telepathic sound] was heard in my ears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">— Run away with your companions. Since you have packed your luggage in advance, you can leave through the back door.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King smiled as he caught a glimpse of where I was hiding.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Don’t worry about me. I won't die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Actually, I don't think Killer King is very similar to Yoo Jonghyuk. It is the same as Kim Dokja, who constantly shouted, "I am Yoo Jonghyuk," and cannot become Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason I'm shaking now is probably because I read 'Ways of Survival' right before I came here.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"I will not die."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That's what Yoo Jonghyuk of 'Ways of Survival' always said right before he died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I won't die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk always left those words behind when he died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To Yoo Jonghyuk himself, those words must have been true. Because he is a regressor who never dies.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But are those words true for those left behind after his death?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Kill him.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time as the constellation gave an order, three wolves rushed towards Killer King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In an instant, the wolf's claws rushed in, aiming at Killer King's front, back, left and right sides.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story fragment 'Heir of the Black Coat' begins its storytelling!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When did he collect such story fragments?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King's brilliant coat fluttering gesture made his claws snap off cleanly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A fierce lion's roar erupted from the corner of Killer King's mouth with a heartless smile.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Fragment of the story 'A person who resembles the voice of the Supreme King' shouts loudly!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I thought he might be able to imitate regression, but of course I didn't have the courage to test that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King, who was hit on the back of the head, gritted his teeth and let out a loud noise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Kim Dokja! hurry!</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is actions, not words, that determine a person's essence. Sincere actions remain as stories, and they are talked about and become stories.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'The Lone Savior' begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The legend accumulated by Killer King was shining brightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is not the same as Yoo Jonghyuk's, but it is no less noble.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That narrative dominated Killer King. It was leading him to his death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you leave him like that, he will die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If we leave him like this, Killer King will die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just like Sergeant Jung Moonho in Seoul Station and Jung Jaewoo in the Theater Dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Jonghyuk. Let me ask you a favor."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ask?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk looked up at me. Facing his suspicious eyes, I searched for items in the 'Dokkaebi Bag'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This worldview is a place where the use of 'skills' and 'stigmata' is prohibited. The effect of the item is also halved and it cannot perform as well as it should.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, no matter what I buy from the 'Dokkaebi Bag', there is no way to kill that 'Wolf Constellation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, it may be possible if it takes some time.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[1,000 coins were consumed in the 'Dokkaebi Bag'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The item 'Red Riding Hood (Replica)' has been acquired.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I placed the items purchased through the 'Dokkaebi Bag' on little Yoo Jonghyuk’s head.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The item's effect increases the target's attention!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk was startled and struggled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The effect of this item is simple.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The wearer becomes a little cuter, more appetizing, and attracts attention.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although the effect of the item is halved here, this should be enough for now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you doing—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment little Yoo Jonghyuk, who had barely peeked his head out of the hood, stood up, the gaze of the wolf constellation turned towards him.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'The Wolf Who Loves Little Red Riding Hood' finds prey!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If that wolf was a normal constellation, it wouldn't have fallen into this trap.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was something different about him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was confident because I had already met several other constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An unstable status for a constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story contained in its incarnation was unbalanced, and its 'character' was not perfect.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A rag-like incarnation made up of old story fragments that have not been properly repaired for a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Crucially, 'The Three Little Pigs' was not the only story that constituted the incarnation of the wolf.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'The Wolf Who Covets Little Red Riding Hood' begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Constellations that have lived for a long time have difficulty distinguishing between their own will and the will of the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the story began its storytelling, the instinct of the guy who had been consumed by the story awakened.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Little Red Riding Hood.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Its bright red, bloodshot eyes began to shine, and it started running toward little Yoo Jonghyuk, wagging its tail like a mad dog.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded solemnly towards little Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let’s run."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you don’t run fast, you will die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk gritted his teeth and looked back at me and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will definitely kill you, Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Almost at the same time, I ducked for cover.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With the fierce wind blowing, Yoo Jonghyuk and the new form of the wolf constellation disappeared at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Coo coo coo coo coo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I looked up outside the cover, I saw little Yoo Jonghyuk running away and a wolf constellation chasing after him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a dangerous sight, as if he was about to be caught, but Yoo Jonghyuk will be fine. I don't know if the guy's stamina was as low as before, but Yoo Jonghyuk's stamina had recovered quite a bit now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw him sitting on my shoulder, secretly taking out an elixir from his pocket, and consuming it with my own eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He eats eight meals a day, so he should have fully recovered by now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's not all.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The effect of the item 'White Rat Mask' is activated!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Animal Mask' does not receive the 'performance reduction effect' of the corresponding world view.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Is it because it is a 'zodiac' worldview?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Mask' is the only item here that maintains its original performance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the effect of 'Rat Mask', which won first place in the 'Zodiac Race', is that there will be no chance of getting caught for a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You guys."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Meanwhile, Killer King, who had defeated all the other wolves, turned to look at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Indeed, the second apostle is Killer King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it possible to subdue a wolf that is not a constellation without using skills or stigmata?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King wiped away his bloody nose and said, glaring in this direction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you know what you did?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The southern part of Zone 13 is the territory of the 'wolves'. Now you—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am the enemy of the wolves."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King looked at me as if he was dumbfounded and muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Have you really become Kim Dokja?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">We started collecting items and story fragments from the fallen wolves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some of the story fragments were useful and some were trash.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not all stories are recycled when they enter the 'Recycling Center'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s not too late. If you’re going to leave, now is your only chance."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King, who was picking up items, stood up and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Go to another zodiac area. You haven’t lost your mask yet, so there must be a way to escape. I will take care of the rest of the group somehow."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don’t like it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first glance, a scar was revealed on the back of Killer King's hand. It was a wound that had never appeared before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This is only the eighth scenario. Do you know how many of the characters we know died on the way to here?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You don’t necessarily need everyone to see the ending."</p>
<p class="orv_line">What Killer King said was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not all characters are needed for the ending of this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I and my companions have now accepted it. This world is not the 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' we used to know.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">No one knows how many more people will die on the journey to the end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some people will live and some people will die. Some will be forgotten and others will be remembered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I also know Killer King knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This story will not end with a beautiful ending like a fairy tale.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I need you to get the ending I want."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s typical of Kim Dokja to be unreasonable. Are you really going to take on that role? I’m sure you know what that means."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quietly looked into Killer King’s eyes. Now I had no choice but to admit it. That person really read 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' a hundred times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He really knows what I'm thinking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth, feeling inexplicably comforted by that fact.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even though you know that—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You seem to be mistaken, but the reason you are needed is because you are so useful."</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter what I do, I cannot become 'Kim Dokja, the Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as Killer King cannot become 'Supreme King Yoo Jonghyuk' no matter what he does.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King looked at me with blank eyes for a moment, then smiled brightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I see. Somebody needs help…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King's eyebrows twitched.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is there some kind of solution? As of now, even if you and I work together, we can’t catch that wolf."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"In theory, yes. But isn’t there something strange about this scenario?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Strange?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The name is 'The Three Little Pigs', but the structure of the scenario is very similar to a scenario we know. The wolf’s position and, of course, the fact that the scenario begins at 'night'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A game to catch a 'werewolf' that kills people by biting them every night.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We already know a ‘scenario’ that is very similar to that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Have you ever wondered why this center is called 'Recycling Center'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Recycle. It literally means to reuse something that has been used. Killer King, who was thinking about something in response to my question, took a deep breath and muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No way…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know who the director of this 'Recycling Center' is or for what purpose this stage was designed. But.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If what I think is right…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swept the dirt off the floor and gauged the flow of the surrounding stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since when did it start?</p>
<p class="orv_line">One by one, the group approached behindKiller King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, Dansu ahjussi, Ye Hyunwoo. And even Cha Yerin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought as I looked at them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only the eighth scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Killer King said, many readers have died. Readers died again and again, as if the world was hostile to them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We are the people in the world who can tell this story better than anyone else."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, 'Kim Dokja' still did not die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let’s start the 'Revolutionary Game' now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">From now on, it is Kim Dokja’s time.</p>
