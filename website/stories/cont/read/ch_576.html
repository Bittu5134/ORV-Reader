<p class="orv_line">—Comment from chapter 516 of Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">When a person faints frequently, there comes a moment when they realize that they are fainting.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If Ji Eunyoo, the editor in charge, had heard me, she would have said, "If you know that, you</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">haven't fainted", putting me in a state of philosophical tension. But fortunately, Ji Eunyoo was</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">not here.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">So, to put it simply,</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I have fainted now. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">At this rate, I'm probably going to faint more than Kim Dokja, the "fainting man", so that's not</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">good.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I forced my eyes open.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was pitch black.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I hadn't woken up yet. I blinked hard, again and again, but all I could see was darkness.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Something about this darkness felt familiar.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">And the feel of the chair against my back. The comfort of my arms on the armrests.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">This was a theater.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">To be precise, it looked a lot like the theater where 'Kim Dokja's Banquet' took place.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">When I casually glanced to the side, there were children sitting in the empty seats.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if they were watching a movie as a group, but when I looked closer, I saw that they</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">were all Kim Dokja.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a chill down my spine.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I was thinking about Kim Dokja too much.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Is that why I'm having this crazy dream?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I rubbed my eyes and looked around again.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I looked again, and they were indeed kkoma Kim Dokjas.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">They didn't seem to notice me at all, and most of them were looking ahead, yawning, or doing</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">something else.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't figure out what I was dreaming about, both symbolically and metaphorically.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Oh, shit, this is crazy, this is ridiculous." 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A voice came from the screen, as if echoing my thoughts.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at the screen along the Kim Dokjas. A movie had been playing there for some time.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Ahjussi! Wake up!" 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Through the pile of rubble, I could see the faces of Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I had a rough idea of what was going on. It must have happened right after I fell off the Dongho</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Bridge.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After spitting out the dirt in his mouth, Dansoo ahjussi asked.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "What happened to Inho-ssi?" 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as he woke up, Dansoo ahjussi looked for me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The first colleague I met.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I could tell by his expression: he was genuinely worried about me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I don't know." 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein said, shaking her head helplessly.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I remember Inho-ssi pushing us, but......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Maybe he was trying to save us."」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The two began to search the area, as if looking for any trace of me, and it wasn't long before they</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">spotted something in the collapsed ruins.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"There is a monster......."」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Seeing the body of the poisonous rhinoceros, Kyung Sein's expression hardened.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 At that moment, she realized what had happened. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Her voice trembled slightly as she continued.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Joonghyuk?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I think he's left now."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you think Inho-ssi went with him?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't think so...... There are traces of someone fighting here."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"A fight?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I think so. I think Yoo Joonghyuk might have attacked them first......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Then Inho-ssi and Heewon-ssi—"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After a moment of silence, Kyung Sein said as if determined.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I'm sure they're not dead. You know Inho-ssi isn't just a regular reader." 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein glanced toward the tunnel leading to Geumho Station.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">immediately. That's because her skill [Sixth Sense] warned her. 」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">She had such a skill.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">pretending to faint until Yoo Joonghyuk's presence completely disappeared.」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If she had moved then, she might have really died.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Looking toward the direction of Dongho Bridge, where Jung Heewon and I had fallen, Kyung</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Sein clenched her fists and spoke.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"But Inho-ssi is still......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"If Inho-ssi and Heewon-nim are alive, they'll go there too. We don't know what's around, so it's</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">dangerous for us to stay here by ourselves."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"......."」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi had lingering eyes, but Kyung Sein's judgment was correct. The two of them would</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">certainly have a hard time when they couldn't even catch a single ground rat.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">own. We should come back with the Cheoldoo Group...... if they're still alive."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I realized I could trust her in my absence.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">She knew exactly what resources we had. I also liked the fact that she didn't forget to check.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The determined kkoma Kim Dokja was smiling subtly, as if he liked that fact.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The girl knows what she's doing.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Cheoldoo Group.」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">At best, I've incited Bang Cheolsoo to remove the danger from Geumho Station. We can't let that</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">crazy Yoo Joonghyuk destroy our peaceful Geumho Station.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi finally agreed, and the two of them hurried to Geumho Station.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Along the way, when they encountered a group of ground rats, they ran away from them, and</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">when one appeared, they bravely fought it off.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder how long they ran like that.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, Geumho Station appeared in front of them.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein stood against the tunnel wall, stopping Dansoo ahjussi from entering the station.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Wait." 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Sharing her vision, I felt a chill in the pit of my stomach.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A black coat fluttered in the light breeze.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 There was Yoo Joonghyuk. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk looked up and down Geumho Station, then tilted his head in disbelief.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "A total of 134 people. That's strange. How did so many survive?" 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">That psychopathic bastard. If a lot of people surived, you should be glad.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, a man at Geumho Station was thinking the same thing.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Who are you?" 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The men walked toward Yoo Joonghyuk with a stern expression. It was the Cheoldoo Group.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I'm asking you, who are you?" 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In exactly three steps, the man's limbs twisted and he fell to the ground.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">At least Kim Dokja and I were in good shape, but we were beaten up after making a statement.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">When I looked over, I saw that kkoma Kim Dokja had a insidious grin on his face.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"W-what's going on!"」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As the man screamed, Bang Cheolsoo and the rest of the Cheoldoo Group, who had noticed the</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">commotion, rushed over.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Thanks to my training, Bang Cheolsoo didn't lunge at him spitting profanities, but instead asked</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">calmly.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Bang Cheolsoo. Are you the leader?"」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo thought for a moment.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if he was already gauging the angle of betrayal.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Our leader is a man named Cheon Inho." 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, he didn't betray me, but it didn't make things any better.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">「"Cheon Inho has already taken over."」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk started to misunderstand. He shook his head a few times, then looked around as</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">if he had the whole situation figured out.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">to get food from now on."」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">But none of the people moved, just stared at Yoo Joonghyuk with fear in their eyes and stepped</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">back. Some of them were shocked to hear that I was dead.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk spoke again.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"There is no such thing as a marginalized group. What are you talking about?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Shut up."」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Under Yoo Joonghyuk's grip, Bang Cheolsoo's body fell to the ground. Yoo Joonghyuk crushed</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">the wriggling Bang Cheolsoo with his foot. He looked at the people of the station and said.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Kuk, my......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"The scenarios ahead will not be easy. If you don't move now, you'll live as slaves forever."」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">This was Yoo Joonghyuk's first encounter with the people of Geumho Station.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was unexpected. He must have seen the same scene and said the same words dozens of times.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, that bastard Yoo Joonghyuk talks like an army instructor on an incomplete topic.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I looked over and saw kkoma Kim Dokja nodding his head.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Somehow, I thought I'd like this kkoma.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">now—"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Let him go!」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if there was a kkoma Kim Dokja over there, too, but it wasn't him but a girl I didn't</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">recognize.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A woman who appeared to be the girl's mom came running out and quickly hugged her.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"But that bad guy is bullying Cheolsoo ahjussi!"」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I remembered who the mother and daughter were.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Aka 'Dayoung and her mother'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">There were definitely people like that in Geumho Station.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A member of the marginalized group who fought against the 'mainstream group' in the main</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">story of 'Omniscient Reader'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Dayoung shouted.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Cheolsoo ahjussi didn't do anything wrong! Why are you bullying him!" 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Dayoung's mom quickly hid her behind her. But her daughter's cries moved her.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, Dayoung's mom spoke up.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Why are you doing this? What do you want?" 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk's eyebrows shot up at her words.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I wasn't threatened. I don't know what the hell you're talking about......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"He took away your food. He used you as slaves, and he sent suicide commandos on the ground</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">in the name of scouting. And you're going to forgive him for that?"」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, Yoo Joonghyuk kicked Bang Cheolsoo on the floor once more.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Dayoung's mother couldn't take it anymore, so she pulled him to his feet. Bang Cheolsoo</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">lowered his head in shame.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As Dayoung's mother looked at his injured face and then looked back at Yoo Joonghyuk as if she</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">had decided something.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"He gave you food?"」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk stopped and looked around, suddenly realizing that something was wrong with</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">the atmosphere at the station.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's exactly what it sounds like."」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">With Dayoung's mother words, the people behind her began to chime in.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"That's right! You don't even know what he was doing, asshole!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Cheolsoo-ssi, come here, you didn't do anything wrong!"」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">These were all people who we gave food to.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo cried as he was supported by the crowd.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that someone asked.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Hey, what do you mean Cheon Inho-ssi is dead?" 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk took a moment to answer.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you kill him?"」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Dayoung's mother asked, and Yoo Joonghyuk didn't answer. Dayoung's mother lameted in a</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">mutter.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">and I thought enough terrible things had already happened........"」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">People glared at Yoo Joonghyuk and started chattering.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">When Yoo Joonghyuk slowly raised his head to face them, the frightened crowd took a couple</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">steps back.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The Cheoldoo Group filled their spots. Nervously, they each grabbed a pipe and stepped forward</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">to protect the people.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">They looked ready to fight if Yoo Joonghyuk charged at them at any moment.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Leave!" 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Dayoung shouted, pointing at Yoo, and the crowd chanted in unison.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Get out of our station now!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Bring back Inho-ssi!"」</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The people shouted.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk glanced down at the small box of snacks that flew toward him.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps he had seen the people of this station many times.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">He had saved them, killed them, taught them, and rejected them.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">And he had given them up.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Yoo Joonghyuk looked around wordlessly. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't tell what he was thinking.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I just prayed that he wouldn't suddenly go crazy and kill everyone.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know how much time passed.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk slipped his hand into his chest.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Author's Note</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Please save them</p>
