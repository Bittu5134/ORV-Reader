            <div class="orv_title"><h1>758 Episode 32 Monkey King (5)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Why on earth is kkoma Kim Dokja here?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m glad that everyone likes him."</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned my head, I saw Lee Jihye playing the Hwipirang. Even her facial expression was different from the younger Lee Jihye in the 41st Round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; overcomes all her scenarios and eventually overcomes even her own sponsor to become the 'Monarch of the Sea'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I worked hard to collect your fragments."</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Through Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, her inner thoughts were heard at times. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your understanding of the person in question is insufficient.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even though I couldn't hear it completely, it was enough to understand the situation.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 In addition to the 41st Round, there was a universe where 'Kim Dokja fragments' were scattered. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And Lee Jihye seems to have collected the 'Kim Dokja fragments' scattered throughout that universe.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' finds it appetizing.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps this 'kkoma Kim Dokja' is a kind of artificial life form created from the fragments of Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Crucially, this 'kkoma Kim Dokja' could  be felt as a soul. That's probably why I was able to possess it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The child who was lightly patting my cheek muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you look like this when you were young?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You were cute when you were young."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung and Lee Gilyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly looked at their faces.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In reality, it was my first time seeing these faces, but the feeling of familiarity was probably because I had already met Shin Yoosoung in the 41st Round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you say one word, I will kill you all."</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, maybe I had also met 'Shin Yoosoung' before my eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "You're Kim Dokja." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This girl possessed herself in the 41st Round and saved me several times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I carefully held the hand of the girl who was squeezing mine. It was only a subtle level of grip strength, but even with that, Shin Yoosoung could sense something on my face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung, who had been looking at me blankly, suddenly tilted her head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Seolhwa, who was watching the situation from afar, approached.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is it an illusion... I think the little man’s condition has just changed."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In response to Shin Yoosoung's words, Lee Seolhwa pulled up my top and took the stethoscope.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, let’s see."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Doctor Lee Seolhwa.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A person who looks almost no different from the 41st Round just by face alone. The difference was the depth of her expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Seolhwa in the 41st Round had a strangely strong spirit of experimentation, while Lee Seolhwa in &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; had the air of a seeker who was well versed in all the truths of the universe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Seolhwa’s eyes met mine and drew a soft arc.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The story’s condition is stable."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A doctor who steadfastly took care of the group even in places where Kim Dokja's eyes could not reach.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Kim Dokja expressed, without her, &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; would not have been able to reach the final scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung urgently grabbed my hand and comforted me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi, can you hear me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">" Shin Yoosoung, don’t bother the kkoma Dokja too much."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn’t mean to bother him."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A gentle hand stroking my head. Yoo Sangah was looking down at me with her characteristic faint smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I looked at her smile, it occurred to me that Kim Dokja's story did not fully describe her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps it was natural.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja's mind is filled with the 'Ways of Survival', and the criteria for judgment are also within the 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The look is enough to slap Yoo Joonghyuk three times in the face. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If we were to apply the standards of 'Ways of Survival', Yoo Sangah was definitely a beautiful woman.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it just how she looks? Her warm heart and warm consideration... But haven’t I been talking only about Yoo Sangah since a while ago?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story fragment 'Kim Dokja who respects Yoo Sangah' continues its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was somehow strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I guess this was the core story that made up 'kkoma Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But doesn’t that seem really dangerous?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye, who was looking at the display screen, said something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What if they really die like that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">On the screen, Ji Eunyu and Cha Yerin were still struggling to drive the carriage. As I was caught up in the shocking situation, I forgot about the people I was supposed to protect.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now was the time to unlock [Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint].</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A temporary error occurs in this skill.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You cannot release 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' level 3.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Shit. What is it again this time?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I became impatient.</p>
<p class="orv_line">On the screen, we saw enemies attacking the carriage we were riding in. Ji Eunyu and Cha Yerin are strong, but the situation is difficult with just the two of them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I don't go right now—</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you want me to possess my past self again?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Gilyoung frowned at Shin Yoosoung’s question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Shin Yoosoung, have you already forgotten that you suffered a probability aftermath before?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It would be better if I logged in as a Constellation and used 'Deus Ex Machina'—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don’t be stupid. That’s a place where outside Constellations can’t intervene."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then why not just descend directly?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Didn’t you hear that descending was prohibited? If you did something like that—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The sooty bastard descended."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That’s because Joonghyuk ahjussi—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why can the sooty bastard do it and I can’t?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">While Yoo Sangah, who was worse off, was trying to stop the two children, Lee Jihye looked at me this time and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kkoma, what do you think? Help me with that? Or not? I think I can just secretly go and use [Intant Kill] once."</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart was beating slowly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know it's just words. Because Lee Jihye doesn’t know that I am now possessing this 'kkoma Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, I had a hard time shaking off the temptation of those words.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 If only I could get help from &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of Ji Eunyu, Cha Yerin, Killer King Cha Sungwoo, Dansu ahjussi, and Kyung Sein's faces one after another.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If we can get help from &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;, we may be able to guarantee the safety of the party.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We will no longer have to face death scenarios.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I moved my hand slowly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was going to tell Lee Jihye. Please help, please help my companions not die— But at that moment, a light spark struck my head.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Why did you want to become a writer?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Distorted sentences appeared on Han Sooyoung’s dying face.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 If we receive help from Kim Dokja Company here, whose story is it? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">While I was breathing hard and blinking my eyes, Lee Jihye turned her head again and looked at her screen.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I’ll drive. Can you take care of the carriage behind me?" 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I heard Yerin-ssi is a minor." 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Yes, but I really wanted to try driving at least once." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The carriage on the screen accelerated with a roar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The group watched the accelerating carriage in silence.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Then I’ll leave it to you for a moment. Yerin, have you ever played a car game?" 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I’ve never tried it, but I think I can try it!" 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Okay. Every game has rules, so let's follow them. I'll take care of the carriage that follows, Yerin—" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Just as the Constellations once watched their story. Just as Kim Dokja read Yoo Joonghyuk's story. &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; silently watched our story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That person over there somehow looks like Sangah-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung said something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"She’s pretty good. It’s not as good as ours."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Gilyoung, who seems to be entering puberty, also left a comment. The companions smiled faintly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Meanwhile, Ji Eunyu blocked the attack of another carriage and overturned two carriages approaching from both sides.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah nodded her head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"She’s a good fighter."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We fought like that too. Do you remember? Back then—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The carriage ran away. A carriage that is neither Apollo's golden chariot nor Surya's train. Nevertheless, I knew what story my companions were seeing through that carriage.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I miss you. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As I listened to the sentence, where I couldn't tell who was thinking, I felt like my heart was breaking for some reason.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; was located here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even after their story was over, they remained here and missed the story. As I read the stories of myself and my companions, I was thinking about one person for a long time.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I miss you. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">How long did they remember those years before a person's name finally became their life?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking up at their faces, for the first time, I lost confidence in what I was about to do.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I was thinking of changing the ending of the 41st Round. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What would happen to these people if I changed the fixed world line?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the ending of the 41st Round is changed, will &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;, which was born from that ending, be safe?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will the probability of this world allow their longing?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The group turned around at the same time at the loud, energetic tone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk was there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk was walking around with a serious expression, calling out Kim Dokja's name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye, who was observing Yoo Joonghyuk, asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You said you fought with Master Odin, right? Did you hit your head wrongly?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, Yoo Sangah, who was worse off, approached Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Joonghyuk-ssi. What’s going on?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk glared at Yoo Sangah for a moment, then began to look at the surrounding space with a bewildered look.</p>
<p class="orv_line">About ten seconds like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There was Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, Kim Dokja has come."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk said as if he was frustrated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It means that 'Kim Dokja' is here now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"huh? But Dokja-ssi—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah, who had been talking up to that point, turned her gaze towards me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah’s eyes slowly grew bigger.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was almost at the same time that Yoo Joonghyuk discovered me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was the first time I knew [Red Phoenix Shunpo] was that good and fast of a skill. When I came to my senses, I was hanging in the air with Yoo Joonghyuk's hand holding my ankle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, Master! What should I do if I hear you say that!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What is this?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"These are the fragments of ahjussi that I collected. Handle them carefully! They may break!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk’s harsh eyes glared at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I imagined turning off [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] several times in my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Master, that’s not him. The real ahjussi is in there right now—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk looked at the screen pointed to by Lee Jihye.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Inside was my figure, stretched out like a squid and bouncing around in a rickety carriage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk looked back and forth between me and me on the screen with confused eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait a minute. The guy over there… he’s passed out just now, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that Shin Yoosoung opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A skill used every time my ahjussi faints."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No way—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">One by one, the eyes of my companions turn to me gathered together.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk, Yoo Sangah, Shin Yoosoung, Lee Gilyoung, Lee Seolhwa, and Lee Jihye.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The gathered group looked at each other with nervous eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Joonghyuk-ssi, are you sure? Did you sense Dokja-ssi’s presence?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That guy has a unique eerie feeling."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What do you think, what does the sooty bastard know?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Can you feel him here now?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk, who held me with his vicious hand, glared at me once again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And after a while, Yoo Joonghyuk's head moved slightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The next moment, an eerie silence swept over the surroundings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The group members looked at each other's faces and nodded at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let’s lock him up."</p>
