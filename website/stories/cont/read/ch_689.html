<p class="orv_line">A huge amount of magical power was flowing out through my right hand, and a bright light appeared above my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dizziness that comes with a feeling of exhaustion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel the gaze of stars in the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The severed head of the 5th grade dragon species was looking up at me in disbelief.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have defeated the 5th grade dragon species mutant Imoogi Bracky!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is astonished by your action!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Goryeo’s First Sword' praises your courage.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' gives a thumbs up, saying he is also a descendant of the Korean Peninsula.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is interested in your fighting style.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some constellations are interested in the proposal of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A total of 5,000 coins were sponsored!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">From afar, I could see Bang Cheolsoo and the people of Geumho Station cheering in this direction.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[30 seconds left until death.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It occurred to me that dying like this wasn't that bad.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The synchronization rate with the sponsor increases.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The possibility of a new story germinates.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">—Youngest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Yes.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You don’t really want to die, do you?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'There are now 20 seconds left.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is there any way to survive right now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, I don't know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Should I once again feed myself to the 'Heir of the Eternal Name'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will that method work this time too?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' refuses to prey on you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It doesn't work either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then there is no way for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now I only trust Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Let’s see. It should be somewhere around here... Uh, over there! The head!</p>
<p class="orv_line">'The head?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Falling head! Hurry!</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I looked closely, I saw that items had fallen between the monster’s head that had fallen on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One was the 'core of a 5th grade monster dragon species', and the other was...</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was startled and picked up the item that had fallen on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be precise, it wasn't an 'item'. It is a fragment that looks like a crude collection of very small letters.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Fragment of the story 'For a reader, a reader’s life' has been acquired.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Why on earth does the dragon have this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Phew, it was there as expected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, why is this—</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Just feed it quickly. If you're being foolish, you'll really be in trouble.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Do you want me to feed it this?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That’s also 'Kim Dokja’s fragment'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just by looking at the name, it was clear that it was a fragment of Kim Dokja.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[5 seconds left until death.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I really don't have time anymore.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is interested in the story fragment you have acquired!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'Want some?'</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' opens its mouth greedily.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Immediately, a sound like biting into a piece of soft meat was heard, and smoke rose from the palm of my hand.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The time limit has elapsed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Was it successful?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Can I keep living?</p>
<p class="orv_line">A series of sentences flowed through my mind as if answering my questions.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"It's okay, Yoo Sangah."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even if you tell me about the app, it won’t help."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The genre of my life now is clearly 'realism'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Because readers have their own lives."</p>
<p class="orv_line">And in this genre, I am not the protagonist but the 'reader'.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">This scene seems to be a fragment of the story, 'For a reader, a reader’s life'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Eventually, the sound of the tale burping lightly after finishing its feast was heard.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' succeeded in predation.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The status of the story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' has slightly increased.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is somewhat satisfied.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[1 day time limit has been added.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">1 day!</p>
<p class="orv_line">My life expectancy increased by a whopping day.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Look at that. I said you wouldn't die here, right?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was dumbfounded and looked up into the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How did Kim Dokja know that this dragon species had 'Kim Dokja’s fragment'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is it possible that this dragon species also appears in Ways of Survival?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It does come out, but not like this. No matter what events exist within 'Ways of Survival', this monster cannot be here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The monster in front of me is a 'dragon species that should not be here right now'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—However, in this '41st round', an incident occurred that did not appear in any episode of 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately understood what Kim Dokja said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this world, there was only one incident that had nothing to do with 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Me and the existence of other readers who have read 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at the dead monster's head and muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No way…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps this monster has eaten and erased 'readers' that I do not know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it has evolved beyond its original level through the fragments obtained in that way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If that's the case, how many fragments of readers exist in this world? And in the process, how many readers...</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Now, let’s not think about it too complicated. It could just be a fragment that fell on the road and was picked up by chance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'There's no way something like this is just lying on the street.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Well, it's a shame.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From a distance, the 4th grade monster could be seen fighting to the death with Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That guy over there has a 'large fragment'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Really?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I’m sure. I can feel it now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A larger fragment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, if I deal with that guy, I can live longer.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[4th grade Earth Dragon species 'Earth Python' activates 'Annihilation Footprints'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The entire area shook violently, and a huge seismic wave was generated centered around the guy's feet. Bright red lava overflowed through the cracks in the cracked ground.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I soared into the air using [Leap], the bloody battle between Jung Heewon and the 4th grade Earth Dragon species was visible at a glance through the clouds of dust and steam.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon injured her thigh and shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the Earth Dragon species also had both wings cut off and one ankle was seriously injured, so it seemed difficult to move.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Strong magical power trembled from Jung Heewon's blade as if trying to determine a match.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ether Blade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blade of pure magical power created through persistent training stretched out, and in an instant, Jung Heewon's divine form disappeared.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation 'Jung Heewon' activates 'Kendo Lv.10'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who appeared from the sky, drew a horizontal trajectory toward the monster's neck.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it is 4th grade, it is an unavoidable blow with injuries like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the unstoppable victory of Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Of course, it’s not an ordinary 4th grade monster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a sound like a swoosh, the new form of the 4th grade Earth Dragon species dispersed like smoke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon made an embarrassed expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before I could warn her, the Earth Dragon species that took over Jung Heewon's rear struck her with its huge tail.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang—</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a sound, Jeong Heewon plummeted to the ground.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The clever Earth Dragon left his last move until the last moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I repeatedly [jumped] with all my might and held Jung Heewon as she fell to the ground. Dark red blood leaked out from Jung Heewon's mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-ssi! Come to your senses!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">She still seems to have not lost her fighting spirit as the aura of [Judgement Time] and [demon slaying] flowed out of her body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I could tell just by feeling her pulse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was no longer in a state to fight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked back at the rear battle line, which had been sorted out to some extent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, there is no penalty for running away in this scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She needs to run away now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When it is difficult for the 4th grade Earth Dragon species to move, we should run away as soon as possible—</p>
<p class="orv_line">—No. Catch that guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Those were Kim Dokja’s words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You don't know when you'll find fragments again. The only chance is now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know. That now is an opportunity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But can I do it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will I be able to kill that guy who even Jung Heewon couldn't defeat?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—There is a chance of victory. [Staging] is not finished yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the hazy dust cleared, the brilliant eyes of the 4th grade Earth Dragon species were revealed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A faint fear reflected in its eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It’s afraid of me now.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is watching your courage.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">—Fight to the death, youngest. If you want to become the real 'Kim Dokja' you want to be.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, I saw Bang Cheolsoo and Dayoung's mother running from behind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hyung! Heewon-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead of Bang Cheolsoo, who was carrying Shin Yoosoung, I looked at Dayoung’s mother.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Please take care of Heewon-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dayoung’s mother didn’t hesitate and carried Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who seemed to be still conscious, opened her eyes wide.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled lightly at Jung Heewon and then spoke to my companions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"From now on, do your best to leave Gwanghwamun."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hyung! You too should leave with us—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Bang Cheolsoo. I can save myself somehow. Protect the people who trust you first."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo, his eyes red, eventually lowered his head. He also knows that there is no way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Withdraw! Everyone, withdraw!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">After Bang Cheolsoo and Dayoung's mother ran away, I looked back at the Earth Dragon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He too was looking this way, growling as if he was ready for a decisive battle.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The time limit for 'Staging' is approaching.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The power of 'staging' weakens.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It is difficult.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We can't end the stage already.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am-"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I was preparing for [Incite] once again, I heard Kim Dokja's words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Reproducing the same scene continuously is not effective.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know. The stage once recreated through 「Staging」 does not have the same level of impact on the constellations.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A very small number of constellations ask if you are telling the same story again.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, this time, like before, it was impossible to confront him just by borrowing the power of 'Kim Dokja who hunted Yamata no Orochi'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I know.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it didn't matter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because-</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Because the person I wanted to recreate this time was not 'Kim Dokja'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if the story has the same content, the main character of the story is different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it's another person, it's a different story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The person I will recreate now is—</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In some ways, that protagonist surpasses even 'Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am 'Yoo Jonghyuk' who defeated the 'Eight-Headed Monarch' in 'Peaceland'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the pages turned in my head, the image of Yoo Jonghyuk and Yamata no Orochi fighting came to mind clearly.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Fragment of the story 'Crazy Soldier Yoo Jonghyuk' squirms.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Accordingly, the unidentified story of Yoo Jonghyuk, who I do not know when I acquired it, began to move within me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'The One Who Hunted the King of Disasters' responds to the story fragment 'Crazy Soldier Yoo Jonghyuk'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I thought I could do it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It’s Yoo Jonghyuk in the moment when he was dealing with Yamata no Orochi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gooooooo!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The aura of Yoo Jonghyuk’s mentor, imbued with the power of stories, was carried on the clear, burning trail of Unbreakable Faith.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Earth Dragon, startled by the subversive force, hesitated and retreated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I leapt in the air, slashing my sword again and again as if struggling. The magic wave that imitated Yoo Jonghyuk's [stage transfomasion] grew around 'Unbreakable Faith'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't easy. Even if I tried my best, reaching Yoo Jonghyuk felt like a long way off.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I!</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I am.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">But at least I wasn't the only one shouting these words now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I am Yoo Jonghyuk!</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I am Yoo Jonghyuk.'</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The synchronization rate with the constellation is increasing!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The reproduction rate of the story increases slightly!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The yellow pupils of the Earth Dragon species became vertically elongated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy was truly shocked. He was so overwhelmed by the story that he began to believe the scenery before his eyes rather than the actual damage he would receive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Eventually, when the guy's fear reached its peak. The frightened monster's new form scattered in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The technique used on Jung Heewon.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Fog ability.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">—You got caught, you bastard.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The special option of 'Unbreakable Faith' is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The fog's weakness is 'elemental attacks'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Ether attribute is converted to 'Flame'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I used [Nagak Breathing] to hold my breath and spin like a top, swinging the blade of flame. The particles that came into contact with the flames suffered a crushing blow and began to melt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wow!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Earth Dragon species regaining its form crashed to the ground with its half-burnt body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, I was like, wow. And I vomited out the things inside me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Following the overlapping [Incite], it was the price of enduring the story of my sponsor for too long.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[「Staging」 ends.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The stage ends and the actor leaves.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'The One Who Hunted the King of Disasters' ends its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I barely raised my head with my hands on the floor. The Earth Dragon species that had collapsed was seen standing up again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The [Fog] ability could no longer be used, but it was still alive and well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like the atmosphere around me was opening up. He is preparing his final [Breath].</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Fragment of the story 'Crazy Soldier Yoo Jonghyuk' looks at you pitifully.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk’s contempt woke me up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't fall. I can never die here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I must protect people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, Jung Eunho, Sergeant Kim, and the people who saved me. I must buy time for them to escape.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The synchronization rate with the sponsor is increasing!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Good job, youngest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A warm feeling began to circulate deep within my heart.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The coordination rate with the sponsor has reached a certain level.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new 'stigmata' has been acquired.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The power of my constellation spread throughout my body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The stigma 'Sacrificial Will Lv.1' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, Kim Dokja's first stigmata bloomed.</p>
