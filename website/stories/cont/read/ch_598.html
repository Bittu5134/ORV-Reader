<p class="orv_line">The moment you write a sentence for an extra, they become a protagonist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When one person becomes the protagonist, the rest become extras.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Help—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"KKuaaak!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I barely saved one person, and another died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I never learned the names of the dead. Even though I was right next to them, I couldn't see how they died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dead people with their eyes open as if in mourning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn it, even in this scene, I was a writer. An insensitive recorder, trying to write a sentence on the blank space created by their deaths.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Nevertheless, someone has to make footprints in this snowfield. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A ground rat nibbled at my thigh.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Someone has to be the protagonist, after all. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I swatted it away, and a second one bit my arm.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 That's what this snowfield is for. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I slammed my arm down on its head. But when I killed one, two came, and when I shook them off, three came.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"N-no—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi! Stop! Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking back at the stairwell, I saw the faces of Kyung Sein, Dansoo ahjussi, and Ye Hyunwoo one after another.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu and Jung Heewon hadn't regained consciousness yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye was busy fending off the monsters coming up the stairwell.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi, what are you doing! Hurry up and come this way!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were still quite a few people who hadn't made it to the stairwell. The fort formations had all collapsed, and the people were cornered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this rate, Chungmuro Station would be wiped out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I made a decision.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know if this will work.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Idea."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, I had to try.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's go."</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Thoughts of Almost Everything' gurgled into the bracelet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I commanded it.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.5' is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Turn into the Ever-changing Stealth Suit."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ever-changing Stealth Suit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The disguise item 'RepresentativeKimDokja' was wearing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the time, I had fulfilled the requirement of 'being hit 10 times' to obtain the appearance of 'Ever-changing Stealth Suit' which allowed me to place this item in the 'mimicry list'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Putting on the 'Ever-changing Stealth Suit'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'Transform into a ground rat.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">A moment later, with a blinding flash of light, my appearance changed to that of a ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ground rats that had been pouncing on me stopped in their tracks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They sniffed and hovered around me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some of them bared their fangs at me, showing their intense hostility.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suppose it's natural for them to be suspicious, since they saw me as a human just a moment ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I used [Incite] on them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am a ground rat."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A few ground rats came up to me and sniffed, then one by one they scurried past me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, the plan worked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I ran backwards through the procession of ground rats and quickly made my way to the center of the platform.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see two giant centipedes roaring at the ceiling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now a bit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Everywhere I looked, the ground rats left out wild cries.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And then.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 ...... ...... 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I heard a strange voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I turned around, wondering where it was coming from.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your exclusive attribute is activated].</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You understand the language settings.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are interpreting the language of the ground rats.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Go up 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The ground rat was speaking.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Runrunrunrun 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Stayclosetomommy 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Justalittlebitjustalittlebit 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Upupup 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A ground rat that was passing by me stopped to look at me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Notthatway 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It looked at me and added.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Runthisway 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I asked it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why?"</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 BecausethatstheorderBecausethatstheorder 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The order. By who?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ground rat shuddered, looked back toward the tunnel, and started running past me again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't hear the answer, but I knew why it was running.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Humans are not the only participants in scenarios.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Everything in this world belongs to the 'scenario'. This was true even for the ground rats in front of me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Mommy 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Helphelphelp 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Cantbreathecantbreathe 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at the floor. There was a pile of bullet-riddled ground rats corpses.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dozens of times more than the dead humans.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The extras, they don't even realize they're extras. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A huge shadow was casted over me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 You 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Since when? A giant centipede was bending over my head.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Why did you come this way? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked around without answering.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was the center of the station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">People were almost at the top of the stairs. The important thing is to stall the time from now on until Gong Pildu unleashes the [Armed Zone] again.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.5' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Look this way!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In response to my [Incite], a bunch of ground rats turned to look at me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Whatwhatwhatwhat 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Wherewherewherewhere 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't enough.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shouted again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This way!"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.5' is being used to the limit!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The level of the exclusive skill 'Incite' has increased!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Poosyuk, Blood trickled from my nose with the sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time, more of them looked back at me. Some of the ground rats that ran straight ahead, others that jumped up to the stairwell and attacked people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were all looking in my direction.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Whatwhat 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Whowhowho 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Whywhywhywhywhy 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly remembered the 'outer gods' from Omniscient Reader. They were extras who died as 'Nameless Ones' in the worldview of the 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was not a Kim Dokja, so I did not have the power to save them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead, I was forced to kill them all to end the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Idea.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">I invoked it, and in my mind's eye, I could see the forms I had collected so far.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Magic Power Recovery Bracelet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damaged Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ever-changing Stealth Suit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Magic Power Stove.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't want to use this items until the end. Because, in return, the platform would be a dead zone for a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But now I had no other choice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Turn into a 'Poison Bomb'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Poison Bomb. It was an item they left behind when we fought the Misreading Association.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A biochemical weapon made from the anal sac of a poisonous rhinoceros.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I picked up one of the used bombs at the time and put it on the possible mimicry list.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The consumed item is restored by the effect of 'Thoughts of Almost Everything'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The rare occasion of shape evolution has occurred!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The form of the item has evolved to a higher level!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Thoughts of Almost Everything' has turned into 'High-Level Poison Bomb'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A moment later, a faintly glowing bomb appeared in front of me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This item is a consumable item.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[When the item is used, you won't be able to use the form again.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The effect of the 'Ever-changing Stealth Suit' will be lifted.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As I reverted to my normal form, the ground rats growled and showed their hostility.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But none of them pounced on me. Even the giant centipede kept a wary distance and glared at my hand for a reason.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I detonate this bomb now, every monster in the station will be wiped out.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Ohnomommyimscared 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Hidebehindmom 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at them for a moment.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Whatsgoingon 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Humanhumanhuman 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 IdontwanttodieIdontwanttodie 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly opened my mouth.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.5' is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"You don't have to die like this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked back at the ground rats, the giant centipedes, and the grolls.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't hurt any more people and go back. Then I won't kill you either."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' admires your boldness.]</p></div>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' marvels at your integrity.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I know the odds are slim.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But theoretically, the monsters and humans could resolve the scenario without harming each other.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There are 7 hours and 12 minutes remaining until the end of the Emergency Defense Battle.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Emergency Defense Battle is a scenario with a time limit. It will end at some point, even if they don't hurt each other."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel the ground rats' agitation.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 A story where no one is the protagonist, maybe. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The extras had died enough. Monsters and humans alike knew.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The ground rats are confused by your 'Incite'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Monsters, too, are but incarnations. They also fear death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They have families, they have friends.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They have lives.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsuchuchuchuchut!</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that sparks exploded in thin air.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some dokkaebis find your attempts to be a threat to the scenario.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many constellations are eager to see the scenario unfold quickly!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The probability of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; is moving.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your 'Incite' has been lifted.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Emergency Defensive Battle will resume.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A few constellations laugh at your reckless behavior.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the message, I thought.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 After all, isn't this world one giant instigator? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">One of the ground rats looked at me and said.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Thereisnosuchstory 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, a mischief of ground rats pounced on me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I replied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a loud explosion. A blizzard of poisonous gas, accompanied by an unpleasant odor, swept across the platform.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I heard the screams of the monsters. The giant centipedes and ground rats dying, their bodies spewing black blood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see the monsters from the tunnel falling to the ground as well. As I watched them die, I thought to myself.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 If only the monsters hadn't died here, this story would have been interesting. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' cheers for the mass murder.]</p></div>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Dragon Lying Down' appreciates your strategy.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stumbled, barely able to catch my breath. I felt like I was going to collapse at any moment, but it wasn't time yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swallowed the Poisonous Rhinoceros' Horn Powder little by little and turned around to start walking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One step, two steps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I walked and walked and walked through a landscape swallowed up by the dense fog, stabbing each approaching ground rat thoroughly, one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swallowed the nausea that rose. A few times I stumbled over dead bodies, and then got back up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I heard a small cry in my ear. It was a dying ground rat. I was about to strike it down with my thorn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized that the ground rat was already dead. Instead, I found a tiny creature squirming in its arms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a ground rat pup.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared down at it in disbelief.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 After all, every story has a protagonist. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As if it wanted to live, the pup struggled to breath and exhale with difficulty.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see the tip of its nose turning black from exposure to the gas.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I bent down and scooped it up in my arms. I poured a little of the remaining Poisonous Rhinoceros' Horn Powder into its mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Its groans gradually ceased.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' is watching your story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I walked across the platform with the pup in my arms. It was hard to see through the fog.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Lotus Blooming Under the Moonlight' is watching your story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I walked and walked and walked, relying on the faint voices of the stars.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little by little, my consciousness faded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could hear voices in the distance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were the voices of those looking for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The tip of my foot caught on something hard. It was the stairs. I had to go up.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is watching your story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced back absentmindedly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The bodies of so many monsters and humans, now buried in the thick fog, were nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took a step up the stairs, and a single footprint imprinted itself.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have achieved an impossible feat.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a pitch black footprint.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your first 'story' is germinating.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I went up the stairs.</p>
