<br>
【Hm? You.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja grabbed the back of my head and looked into my face for a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a strange tension in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thinking about it, this wasn&#39;t my first encounter with &#39;RepresentativeKimDokja&#39;. I had met him</p>
<p class="orv_line">once before at the Chungmuro Theater.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Back then, he had seen my face and even checked my name tag.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was that all?</p>
<p class="orv_line">He gave me privileges to help me adjust to this world, and he read the entire Omniscient Reader</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had written and left comments and impressions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Would &#39;RepresentativeKimDokja&#39; recognize me?</p>
【Hmm.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Or he wouldn&#39;t recognize me as I expected.</p>
【That&#39;s weird. How come you haven&#39;t gone back yet?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja walked out of the theater, holding the back of my head like a cat</p>
<p class="orv_line">clinging to a fish from a fish tank.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So did Yoo Joonghyuk, and I don&#39;t know why the hell everyone who sees me wants to carry me</p>
<p class="orv_line">around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, he didn&#39;t recognize me after all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hesitated for a moment, then decided to implement the plan I&#39;d been thinking about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Idea.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I said the name in my head, the bracelet on my wrist twitched.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know exactly why, but unlike my other items, the &#39;Idea of Almost Anything&#39; had been</p>
<p class="orv_line">summoned here with me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Either way, it was a good thing for me right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait, I don&#39;t like hanging like this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grabbed RepresentativeKimDokja&#39;s wrist, who gripped the back of my head while thinking. I</p>
<p class="orv_line">could feel the surface of the bracelet resonating against his hand.</p>
[&#39;Idea&#39; is making contact with an unknown item.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Look at this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#39;m clearly touching his skin, but you call it an &#39;item&#39;?</p>
[Beginning target analysis.]</p></div>
[Target analysis will take 5 minutes to complete.]</p></div>
[Maintain contact until the end of the analysis.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja was deep in thought and didn&#39;t notice the &#39;Idea&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I spoke up again in a frustrated tone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I didn&#39;t go in there because I wanted to, I was just trying to find a way out of here.&quot;</p>
【What did you see in there?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Little kids.......&quot;</p>
[Someone has used &#39;Lie Detection&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;RepresentativeKimDokja&#39; must be an &#39;outer god&#39;, and if you&#39;re an outer god, you&#39;re bound to</p>
<p class="orv_line">have [Lie Detection].</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s a good thing for me.</p>
[The exclusive skill &#39;Incite Lv.4&#39; is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I saw some little kids watching a movie inside the theater. But it was dark, so I couldn&#39;t see</p>
<p class="orv_line">much.&quot;</p>
[You have incited yourself.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What movie were the little kids watching?&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">【What kind of movie was it?】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I couldn&#39;t look closely because it was dark.&quot;</p>
[Someone has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p></div>
【Hmm.......】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja glared at me with suspicion, then slowly loosened his grip on the back</p>
<p class="orv_line">of my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I did not let go of his wrist.</p>
[Continuing the analysis of the target.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait, what are those kids, and why are there so many of them here?&quot;</p>
【Do you want to know?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#39;t see RepresentativeKimDokja&#39;s eyes because he was wearing sunglasses. However, I</p>
<p class="orv_line">could clearly feel the life that radiated from them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, I&#39;m not too curious.&quot;</p>
【Good, because a story where you know the ending is boring.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja nodded in satisfaction.</p>
【Now, if you&#39;ll let go of my wrist, I need to find out why you didn&#39;t make it back.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s a problem.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#39;m not done analyzing you yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I still have one more question.&quot;</p>
【Is that a question you can only ask while grabbing my wrist?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Behind his sunglasses, I could see the murderous intent once again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But this time, I didn&#39;t back down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>
【Hmm? Like I said, I—】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re not the &#39;RepresentativeKimDokja&#39; I know, because I&#39;ve met him before I came here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In reality, I had only met him once, but I had known him for a very long time.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">He messaged me every day for the duration of the series.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I found &#39;RepresentativeKimDokja&#39; to be a very serious and story-loving person.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what about the &#39;RepresentativeKimDokja&#39; in front of me now?</p>
【That&#39;s a great insight. Even though our appearances should be exactly the same.......】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Unexpectedly, RepresentativeKimDokja readily admitted the truth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">enough to answer your question?】</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were two RepresentativeKimDokjas.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe more than two.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it a group?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If so, what does this group exist for?</p>
[The analysis is more than 80% complete.]</p></div>
【It&#39;s my turn to ask. You—】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why &#39;Kim Dokja&#39;?&quot;</p>
【What?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you needed to disguise yourself, you could have been Yoo Joonghyuk or someone else.&quot;</p>
【No, this is just—】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I thought you hated Kim Dokja?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At my question, for the first time, RepresentativeKimDokja&#39;s complexion changed.</p>
【Why do you think that?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Was it actually because you were envious of him? Is that why you took on Kim Dokja&#39;s</p>
<p class="orv_line">appearance and you&#39;re imitating him?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja&#39;s face slowly hardened. It was as if a vague clue had been unraveled.</p>
[The exclusive attribute is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">For a brief moment, the clues left by RepresentativeKimDokja at the previous Banquet branched</p>
<p class="orv_line">out in my mind.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">「Kim Dokja, Kim Dokja, Kim Dokja, you&#39;re really loud. Why the hell do you like him so</p>
<p class="orv_line">much?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">He harbored a grudge against Kim Dokja.</p>
「What kind of life will those who are not chosen by Kim Dokja live?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He sympathized with those who were not saved by Kim Dokja.</p>
「Are you really planning to rely on &lt;Kim Dokja&#39;s Company&gt; here as well?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He wanted to complete the end of the world without &lt;Kim Dokja&#39;s Company&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So my reasoning went like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did Kim Dokja...... ruin your story?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is a &#39;character&#39; who could not fulfill the story he wanted because of Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s why the readers of &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39; have been kidnapped into this world.</p>
「To create the story he wants.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Who could he be.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had a few characters in my head, but no names I was sure of.</p>
【You...... Who are you?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A sudden momentum began to emanate from RepresentativeKimDokja&#39;s entire body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I felt sick.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was digging too deep.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsuchuchuchuchuchut—</p>
<p class="orv_line">Intense sparks began to fly around me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In my head, I weighed the magnitude of the sparks against my life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How much probability would it take for him to kill me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">And how much more probability was he willing to sacrifice?</p>
[The item analysis has been completed!]</p></div>
[The item is &#39;Ever-changing (千變萬化)1 Stealth Suit&#39;.]</p></div>
[The item is S-grade.]</p></div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">[You must be hit at least 10 times by the user of the item to obtain the item&#39;s form.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just in time, the analysis of the &#39;Idea&#39; has ended.</p>
「Ever-changing Stealth Suit.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">An item of clothing that consumes a certain amount of magic to turn the user&#39;s appearance into</p>
<p class="orv_line">the desired one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, he&#39;s using the item&#39;s power to hide his true self.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Idea.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately changed the form of the bracelet.</p>
[The exclusive skill &#39;Incite Lv.4&#39; is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Turn into the Damaged Samyeongdang&#39;s Bamboo Stick.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wielded the &#39;Damaged Samyeongdang&#39;s Bamboo Stick&#39; with all my might at</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The tip of his lip twisted, RepresentativeKimDokja lightly stretched out his arm and grabbed the</p>
<p class="orv_line">bamboo stick.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, I didn&#39;t expect the attack to work. But it wasn&#39;t the strike I was aiming for in the first</p>
<p class="orv_line">place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Soon, a bright light emanated from the end of the bamboo stick.</p>
[&#39;Damaged Samyeongdang&#39;s Bamboo Stick&#39;&#39;s hidden property is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As a damaged star relic, it was unable to produce its original power, but it had no problem</p>
<p class="orv_line">triggering the hidden property.</p>
[The stigma &#39;Skeleton in the Closet&#39; has been triggered!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If he&#39;s wearing the &#39;Ever-changing Stealth Suit&#39;, he&#39;ll have no choice but to reveal his true self in</p>
<p class="orv_line">front of this stigma.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Patsuchuchut.</p>
[&#39;Skeleton in the Closet&#39; is affected by your status.]</p></div>
[Your status does not allow you to determine the target&#39;s identity.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Damn it, that was too much for my level.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But for the briefest of moments, I saw part of his cheek crack.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Beyond the crack, an unspoken tension pulsed. A flow of stories so dangerous as to be mindnumbing. An ominous sensation lurking beyond.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Demon Force?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I thought that, his fist stuck in my stomach.</p>
【You must think I can&#39;t kill you.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The feeling of my stomach being ripped open and pierced.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though I was a soul, my breath caught in my throat.</p>
【In fact, you&#39;re right. I can&#39;t kill you directly. There are restrictions on that.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My left and right arms snapped in different directions, and a painful sensation came over me as if</p>
<p class="orv_line">my legs had been amputated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as I inhaled, something hit my stomach again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, my consciousness slipped away and came back.</p>
【But I can give you a pain worse than death.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He held both my arms together and pushed me back against the wall, then put his magically</p>
<p class="orv_line">formed thorns into my wrists and ankles one after another.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Pow. Pow. Pow. Pow. Pow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In an instant, five or six thorns pierced my limbs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I activated my skill just before the pain began to spread.</p>
[The level of the exclusive skill &#39;Incite&#39; has increased!]</p></div>
「I am Kim Dokja who has the [Fourth Wall].」</p></div>
【Certainly...... You&#39;re not like other readers. I can&#39;t believe you can endure this pain.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He lightly lifted my chin with his long fingers, and then said with interest.</p>
【Come to think of it, I did hear about a special guy from another Representative.......】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If I&#39;m a special guest, you should treat me specially.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I provoked him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had to provoke him further, push him over the edge.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you&#39;re only this good, you&#39;d already lost to Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The spark that had been running through his body earlier was getting stronger and stronger. Any</p>
<p class="orv_line">moment now, he wouldn&#39;t be able to withstand the aftermath of probability.</p>
【I&#39;m getting more and more curious about who you are.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But RepresentativeKimDokja was smiling subtly at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It looked like he was as pleased as angry.</p>
【Suddenly, I feel very nostalgic.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja&#39;s head turned slowly to an odd angle.</p>
【Right now, you look like someone I hate more than anyone and wanted to eat at the same time.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Pow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt something dig into my stomach, and the next moment, my stomach was clutched in his</p>
<p class="orv_line">grip.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A pain that even the level 5 [Incite] couldn&#39;t handle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsuchuchuchuchut.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that something began to ooze from the hole in my stomach.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sentences, shimmering with golden light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja&#39;s eyes widened.</p>
【This is...... No way? You.......】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment he reached out for the story that had fallen to the floor.</p>
「⬛⬛⬛ ⬛⬛⬛ ⬛⬛」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The story began its storytelling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The space around me ripped apart, and my ears rang like a storm was brewing here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then I heard a clear voice.</p>
「I told you not to touch it」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja&#39;s expression hardened. His eyes widened and he looked me in the eyes.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Something was speaking through my mouth.</p>
「The y are co ming」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, the ceiling of the movie theater crumbled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Within my blurry consciousness, I saw RepresentativeKimDokja look up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone shouted, and something flew through the cracked ceiling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A beautiful thread of light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It caught me by surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In my slowly fading consciousness, I heard the voice of the angry RepresentativeKimDokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was probably,</p>
「......Kim Dokja&#39;s Company!」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He seemed to say something like that.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Author&#39;s Note</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did we hear it wrong?</p>
