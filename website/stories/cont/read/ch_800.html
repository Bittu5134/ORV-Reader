            <div class="orv_title"><h1>800 Episode 38 Chance (6)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">A splendid army of seraphs illuminated the darkness. The seraphs of &lt;Eden&gt;, each of which was as strong as a great-grade constellation, and the archangels of &lt;Eden&gt; who commanded them, revealed their outlines in the void.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, most of them were archangels I knew.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Lily pin of Aquarius' looks at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Archangel Gabriel.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Guardian of Youth and Travel' looks at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Archangel Raphael.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Friend of Justice and Harmony' takes pity on you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'He who looks face to face with God' looks at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Archangel Raguel and Camael.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King's sponsor, Archangel Jophiel.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Savior of the Fall' is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even Michael, the strongest archangel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I calmed my pounding heart and checked the faces of the archangels again and again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel is gone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A belated worry came over me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe she had tried too hard to save me last time. Or maybe I had received some kind of threat from &lt;Eden&gt;.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Come to your senses. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As if it was not the time to worry about Uriel, the Demon King of Salvation warned through the [Fourth Wall]. I swallowed and nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fact that I could endure facing such magnificent archangels was all thanks to the naked (clothed) man blocking my way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The monarch slayer Jaehwan.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized once again how great he was. Even if you search through the entire &lt;Star Stream&gt;, it would be difficult to find a constellation that wouldn’t be intimidated by a single giant nebula.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even that figure calmly reaching for the hilt of his sword as if such a threat was ridiculous…</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait a minute!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jaehwan glared at me with a sharp gaze. I belatedly regretted it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that I think about it, why did I do that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did I stop Jaehwan?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"They might not have come to fight."</p>
<p class="orv_line">That’s right. That was my reason.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While I was with the 'Demon King of Salvation', I was chased by giant nebulas several times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Asgard&gt; and &lt;Olympus&gt;. Or small nebulas like &lt;Gwiok&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I’ve never been chased by &lt;Eden&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let’s talk about it first."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why should I?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, Jaehwan, the 'Monarch Slayer', has another nickname, 'God Slayer'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There's no need to hurt someone who doesn't have any hostility."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That guy Yoo Jonghyuk told me. He said that there are no harmless constellations in the world."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jonghyuk, what on earth did he say?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, constellations aren’t generally harmful."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know why I'm defending the constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But this was the only way to prevent a catastrophe. If there was Uriel among them that I hadn't discovered, it would be a big deal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took a deep breath and spoke in one breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's Yoo Jonghyuk's standard, and yours is different. Look at those fluttering pure white wings. Do they look like bad constellations to you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jaehwan glanced at the archangels again at my words. Maybe the monarch killer was a pretty sensible person.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, one of the archangels who caught my eye stepped forward. He was the archangel who shouldn't have stepped forward the most.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are the 'Monarch Slayer'—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I stepped in front of Jaehwan before Archangel Stab was activated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Over there! Wait a minute! Over there!"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[...?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Savior of the Corrupted! Don't finish that sentence now!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Michael glared at me as I stepped in front of Jaehwan and opened my mouth again.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[What are you?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Michael, the Savior of the Fall, is a constellation of the Tale of the Fall. He's not even a simple Tale of the Fall, he's an archangel who can reach the level of a myth-grade when he activates 'Demon King'. There's probably only one incarnation in the entire &lt;Star Stream&gt; who can tease an archangel like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Me? I'm Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn it, why am I Kim Dokja?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Michael, who had been glaring at me, asked back in a stupid voice.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[So?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's all get along well."</p>
<p class="orv_line">An eerie silence swept over the surroundings. I heard Raphael's sighing voice, and I also saw Gabriel shaking his head with his hand on his head. Jophiel stared at me as if he was looking at a strange creature.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And then,</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kugugugugu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Michael began to unleash his power without hesitation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Savior of the Fall' reveals his power.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I hid behind Jaehwan again while watching Michael approaching step by step.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, why wouldn't I want to see it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Michael vs. Jaehwan.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Savior of the Fall vs. Monarch Slayer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Especially, if it was Michael and Jaehwan who activated 'Demon King', it would be a spectacle that I wouldn't be able to see even if I paid a thousand gold coins.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, that's something rlaehrwk41 would think about, and it wasn't something I would be thinking about right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If a great clash of myth-grade constellations occurred right before my eyes, Yoo Jonghyuk and I would be swept away by the fierce waves of the stories and our limbs would be torn apart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey, Jaehwan-ssi. Actually, this is a bad guy. Could you kill just one of them?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">While Jaehwan was looking back at me as if he was dumbfounded, the other archangels were approaching Michael.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shouted in a hurry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait a minute! Stop! You know how scary this guy is!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thankfully, the archangels had heard rumors of Jaehwan and were not acting rashly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"And this guy is not an evil person! He rejects evil and worships good! Isn't that the motto of your &lt;Eden&gt;? Never judge by appearances! He's even dressed so neatly!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You bastard."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I ignored Jaehwan's growling words and continued to shout.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This person saved me and Yoo Jonghyuk. He saved us from the terrible constellations of &lt;Olympus&gt; and &lt;Asgard&gt;— from the gods of the other world!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jaehwan's sword, which was half-drawn, stopped for the first time. It felt like he was trying to hear what I was saying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This person also patted my back when I swallowed story fragments. It hurt so much that I could die, but I survived, so I guess I received the grace of life."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is that all? He stabbed and killed every outer god who came near him for a whole ten days. Where else would you find someone who would show me such kindness while the giant nebulae were after me? Yes?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I came to my senses, I found myself repeating the argument of the 'Demon King of Salvation' like a parrot. But as I spoke, it seemed like he was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A murderer of monarchs is not a villain. At least to me and Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Archangel Jophiel seemed to have a slightly different opinion.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[He is evil.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">An ominous light was flowing out of Jophiel’s eyes. His stigma, [Eye of Sin], had been activated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When Jaehwan glared at him as if asking what was that, the light of [Eye of Sin] went out with a tsk-tsk sound. It seemed that an absolute being from another universe could extinguish a stigma just by glaring at it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But even in that situation, Jophiel seemed to have witnessed something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I struck first before he could open his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. Of course, it could be different depending on the perspective—"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[He slaughtered over a million gods.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked back at Jaehwan.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This kid is a villain, right?</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I pretended to be calm and responded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Couldn’t all the gods he killed be bad guys? He must have done it with good intentions. Right? He must have tried to make the world a better place—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"My goal was to destroy the world."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, so to put it simply, in order to kill the evil gods and purify the world—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I killed them because they got in my way."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to tell him to shut up, but since ancient times, protagonists have never shut up when told to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the meantime, another protagonist who had come to his senses spoke to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk was getting up from the floating stone. He seemed to have figured out the general situation.  </p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk opened his mouth to the archangels, receiving my gaze that told him to stop them somehow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I want to kill them all."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jaehwan nodded and muttered at Yoo Jonghyuk's words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There are times when we can see eye to eye."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The situation was becoming increasingly chaotic.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I thought that this wouldn't be easy to solve even if the Demon King of Salvation came in person, Jaehwan's expression changed for the first time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This is fun."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The word 'fun' sounded different after meeting him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I followed Jaehwan's gaze, hiding my ominous feelings. Then, the line of seraphs split, and an archangel was seen walking from the back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The mythical constellation of &lt;Eden&gt; was there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The controller of the archangels, and the second-in-command of &lt;Eden&gt;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Heavenly Scribe' is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Heavenly Scribe, Metatron.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who would have thought I would see him here?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I bit my lips without realizing it. The fact that he was here  in person meant that &lt;Eden&gt; was serious about this situation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[It's nice to meet you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A uniquely polite and calm voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first place his eyes turned to was little Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The oldest dream’s puppet.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then he looked at Jaehwan.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The monarch slayer.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, he stared at me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[And...]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He looked at me for a long time, then continued speaking with a faint sense of pride.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Little lamb. You're afraid.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course. My sponsor would be scared if legions of archangels came rushing in. What's more, if the opponent was 'Metatron', the master of strategy that even Kim Dokja would shiver with…</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Don't worry. &lt;Eden&gt; and I will not harm you. We have no intention of changing the contents of the 'Revelation'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately revised my evaluation of Metatron in my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What kind of place is &lt;Eden&gt;? It is a nebula of angels. Angels are generally kind. If he is the representative of such angels, then he must be the kindest angel of all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I briefly hoped that he might mediate all of this.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[However, I cannot tolerate beings who break the balance of this world line.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a vain hope.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Metatron and Jaehwan's gazes crossed, Jaehwan pulled out his sword with a bitter smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Your tongue is long. If you are going to attack, attack quickly."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The archangels who were guarding Metatron quietly raised their voices at his arrogant tone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, Jaehwan continued to speak as if provoking them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Do you think you can stop me with just a single person?”</p>
<p class="orv_line">The strength to fight a giant nebula alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Metatron acknowledged Jaehwan like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He nodded.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Absolute being of another world line. I know you are strong. If we were to eliminate you, we would not be safe either.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"You will all die here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Metatron shrugged lightly and smiled bitterly.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I guess you forgot that this is not your 'worldview'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That was when I felt an unusual magical power behind us. A being with the exact opposite attribute of the archangels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were beings that should not be there.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Demon King 'Lord of Hell' descends into the void!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Demon King 'Sonic Demon King' descends into the void!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Demon King 'Temptation and Barren Demon King' descends into the void!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Demon King 'Merciless Hunter of the Reverse Heaven' descends into the void!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Demon King 'Ruler of Eastern Hell' descends into the void!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Demon Kings. It was unbelievable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why on earth did they show up here?</p>
<p class="orv_line">They wouldn't be trying to start a holy war here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hold on. Holy war?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Run away. Right now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jaehwan glared at me as if I was talking nonsense.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you talking about me just now?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's right! Run away with me and Yoo Jonghyuk! Right now!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't think Jaehwan will lose. Even if it's a myth-grade constellation, even if it's the famous &lt;Eden&gt;, it wouldn't be easy to deal with Jaehwan.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 But if it's 'sealing' him, it might be a different story. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Two pitch-black swirling spheres were placed in Metatron's hands. I already knew what those spheres were.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Get out of this story. Ghost of a ruined universe.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That was a forbidden technique that Han Sooyoung once used to seal 'Yoo Jonghyuk of the 1,863rd round.'</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Mythical tale 'Seal of the Apocalypse' begins its storytelling!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As long as this is the &lt;Star Stream&gt;, there is no one who can break that seal.</p>
