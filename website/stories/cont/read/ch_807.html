<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Recorders of Fear' are crashing into this world in the form of 'possession'?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Are all the Recorders of Fears like that?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm not sure either."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">With that thought, several cases came to mind.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">One was 'Bicheonhori' that I met at the 'Recycling Center', and the other was me and other readers.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If the characteristic of 'possession' itself is a characteristic of the Recorders of Fear...</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"However, there is this saying. The 'Recorders of Fear' appear and disappear as if they are invading the world line."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">They appear and disappear as if they are invading the world line.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I asked, repeating that expression to myself.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What is their purpose?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Well. I guess it's to interpret 'fear'?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Fear. That word, which had been repeated before, now sounded unfamiliar.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What on earth is this 'fear' that they are talking about?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"If it could be explained that simply, the name 'Recorder of Fear' wouldn't have existed in the first place."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Can't you understand it even in a general way?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"In a general way..."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The story expert began to calmly organize the place he had used. He swept away the story fragments that were scattered in a chaotic manner and neatly put the brushes he had used into his brush. The reason all of his actions seemed to have some meaning was probably because he was a story expert.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The story expert finally finished organizing and opened his mouth.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What do you think is the greatest story that makes up this world?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I answered without thinking for long.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I think it's a 'scenario'."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Everything in this world is made up of 'stories.' And the biggest flow that leads those stories was the 'scenario' hosted by the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsut.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I can tell just by looking at the fact that my existence is soon in danger.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">This universe is a world where you are granted a 'qualification' just by participating in a scenario. Satisfied with my answer, the story expert nodded and smiled.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Then where do you think that 'scenario' came from?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"That's..."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Here, saying that it was actually written by a writer named Han Sooyoung wouldn't be of much help.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Also, even if the designer of the scenario was Han Sooyoung, that wasn't the logical probability that supported this world.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">There must be scenarios in this world that Han Sooyoung didn't write.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In addition, Han Sooyoung didn't know all the content of the scenarios from birth.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">She must have written the scenarios based on what she learned from other content and her own experiences.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">When I thought about it that far, I felt strange. When I thought about it, all the 'great story scenarios' I knew were familiar.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Olympus' &lt;Gigantomachia&gt;.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Eden and the Demon World's &lt;The Great Battle of the Holy Demon&gt;.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The Emperor's &lt;Journey to the West&gt;.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">They were all scenarios based on famous stories.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">And that's not all? The general scenarios were the same. A battle royale survival game, or a variation of a mafia game.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, scenarios are based on existing 'stories'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Aren't most scenarios based on old 'tales'?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The god nodded again, but didn't smile. It meant that my answer was incomplete.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"That's right. To be more precise."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The god blinked for a moment as if choosing his words, then opened his mouth.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"All scenarios are 'interpreted tales'."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Interpreted tales.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A bright light flashed in my head.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"A very small interpretation of a tale can sometimes change the entire universe."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The elf nodded again and smiled.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I see you understand now."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Are the recorders of fear the ones who interpret 'uninterpreted tales'?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"That's what I think."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Those tales are 'fears'."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Uninterpreted stories are difficult. They are unfamiliar, and sometimes even incomprehensible. The source of that incomprehensibility is fear.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Even this &lt;Star Stream&gt; has not yet been able to interpret the tales, the Recorders of Fear love such stories."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">'Secretive Plotter' suddenly came to mind.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps the Recorders of Fear admired him because he was the 'uninterpretable being' of all people in this world.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I heard you are participating in the Fear Expedition this time."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, that is what happened."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The story expert looked at me with a slightly complicated expression and was about to open his mouth again when.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"The Lord of the House calls."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">At the perfect timing, the guard opened the door and appeared. The guard's gaze was unusual, as if he had been eavesdropping on our conversation.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The story expert Lowellyn sighed lightly and looked at me, mouthing.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">—I tried to keep you alive, so don't die.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded my head in gratitude.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The conversation with the story expert was beneficial in its own way.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The most important thing was the information I gained about the 'Recorders of Fear.'</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Maybe me and other readers are also destined to eventually become 'recorders of fear'. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I decided not to think too deeply about it. Because the information I could know right now was too limited. For now, it was important to deal with the immediate issues one by one.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Steadily, like writing one sentence and then writing the next.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If every moment of my life becomes a story, then eventually this moment will also be written as a story.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In order not to leave this moment as a vague 'fear', I had to keep thinking and moving.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">When Yoo Jonghyuk finished his breakfast, the escorting person came to see us again.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"The expedition team will be announced soon. I think the guests should come with us."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After discussing with the head of the household, we decided to participate in the 'Fear Expedition' as representatives of the Namgung family.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new main scenario is about to begin!]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">My heart raced at the thought of finally entering a new scenario. I don't know if it was because I was scared or nervous. I pretended to talk to Yoo Jonghyuk to hide my trembling.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"You suddenly had a trance ritual while listening to the words of the story expert. Did you gain some kind of enlightenment?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk shook his head at my question.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I thought you had transcended."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"If transcending could happen that easily, the martial arts world would already be full of transcendent beings."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, I guess so."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I have a habit of having a trance ritual whenever I feel like it. I can't miss even the smallest hint of enlightenment."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I realized once again how sincere Yoo Jonghyuk is. No matter how often he acts like a transcendent, Yoo Jonghyuk is fundamentally a transcendent who works hard.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">He must have lived so diligently to become the ultimate transcendent after going through 1,863 regressions.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your understanding of the character 'Yoo Jonghyuk' has increased.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Yoo Jonghyuk' shows you a little favor.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I was startled by the message that suddenly came.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">My understanding has suddenly increased?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Why?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's nothing."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I had to bite my lips several times to hide my expression.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">When I first met him, I thought he would never be my comrade.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">That was understandable, because 'Yoo Jonghyuk of the 41st round' was considered one of the worst Yoo Jonghyuks among the many Yoo Jonghyuks.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">And yet, I was able to gain a little favor from him. That alone felt like enough compensation for my 'martial arts journey'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Now that we've entered the realm of fear, you won't throw me off a cliff, right?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What nonsense are you talking about?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I just shrugged.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk glared at me with a strange expression and added.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It seems like you've made some progress."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you notice?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, the eyes of the regressor cannot be avoided.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, there was progress for me. Not something profound like enlightenment, but progress that was obvious enough to be seen right away.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Congratulations! Your story has successfully evolved!]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' has evolved into a mythical-level story!]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, 'Heir to the Eternal Name' has become a mythical-level story.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know why this story suddenly evolved. Maybe the story, worried that I would soon die, evolved on its own.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' snorts.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Or maybe it was helpful that I spent the whole night wondering about 'Kim Dokja' after talking to the story expert yesterday.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In any case, with this, I finally became the owner of a 'mythical-level story'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">And the next moment, a bright light began to flow out from Kim Dokja's smartphone.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The function of the Holy Relic has evolved!]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The function of the Holy Relic has evolved.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe this is the first effect of the 'mythical tale'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as I turned on my smartphone, the platform screen appeared first.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>…</p>
<p>Episode ◼️◼️. ◼️◼️ (◼️) +[??]</p>
<p>Episode ◼️◼️. ◼️◼️ (◼️) +[??]</p>
<p>Episode ◼️◼️. ◼️◼️ (◼️) +[??]</p>
<p>…</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Why can't I see the latest episode?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I pressed refresh several times, but the screen didn't change.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">What happened to the serialization record? Or—</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Uninterpreted story. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">My head felt dizzy.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I'm now an exile, outside the scenario.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If that's why this moment was 'uninterpreted'. So what if these episodes aren't visible?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was a plausible assumption, but it wasn't yet certain.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Above all, there was one thing left to check.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can check one comment for the desired chapter using the 'Daily Free Pass'.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, I could still check the comments. Does that mean the series was proceeding normally?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I'll know when I check the comments.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Now, you can check the 'comments with many recommendations' first without using coins.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Would you like to use the 'Daily Free Pass'?]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">An unexpected suggestion. It seemed that this was an effect added through 「Heir to the Eternal Name」.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Up until now, it was difficult to gather information efficiently because of the 'random comment confirmation system'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">That's understandable, because when you check comments randomly, it was difficult to avoid comments that randomly spammed Yoo Jonghyuk's name or the Demon King of Salvation's name.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">However, if I could see only comments with many 'recommendations', it would be a different story. The fact that it was recommended by many readers means that there is a high probability that it has hit the core of that 'chapter'. Above all, it is highly likely that it will avoid meaningless comments. Of course, there was a function to check 'recommended comments' using additional coins in the past, but as the cost increases with each chapter (after chapter 200, it started to demand a whopping 10,000 coins per comment), recently I hardly ever checked the 'recommended comments'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">But they're releasing that feature for free. I couldn't miss this opportunity.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[One free daily ticket will be deducted.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Check the comment with the most 'recommendations'.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I checked the comments right away.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Well, indeed.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>—Eung◼️i! Eung◼️i! Eung◼️i! Eung◼️i! Eung◼️i! Eung◼️i! Eung◼️i! Eung◼️i! Eung◼️i! Eung◼️i! Eung◼️i! Eung◼️i! Eung◼️i! Eung◼️i! Eung◼️i!</p>

</div>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at the empty ◼️ part between 'Eung' and 'i' for a moment.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I thought that uninterpreted stories are scary, but uninterpreted comments might be scary too. That must be it?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Why on earth did this comment get the most upvotes?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I can't understand what Kim Dokja is thinking right now.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I checked the second comment.</p>

</div>
<p class="orv_line">Hmm.</p>
<br>

<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, the third most upvoted comment was open to interpretation.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_window">

<p>Recommended 98 / Not recommended 3</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Sometimes, comments are scarier when interpreted.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Isn't this really how I die? 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I blankly stared at the comment, then suddenly went back to the first comment and checked how many times '엉◼️이' was used.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was 41 times in total.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, a series of keywords came together in my head.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">엉◼️이, 41. 팡◼️. He's not really going to die like this?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Wait a minute, this can't be.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I reflexively looked around and muttered.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Jonghyuk."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">And then the real fear began.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Jonghyuk?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk disappeared.</p>
