<p class="orv_line">"I got creeped out, so I closed my eyes and swung at them, and they stopped......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at the crumpled Specter and sighed. Jung Heewon scolded me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"You could have told me more beforehand."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It would have been nice, but I hated the fact that the moment I told her, I would have to explain</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">why I knew that.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Once again, I felt the wisdom of Kim Dokja's words.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn't know for sure either. What about the others?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I laid them over there."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I turned my head and saw Dansoo ahjussi stretched out and Kyung Sein curled up in a ball.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's been like that since earlier."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I was surprised. Dansoo ahjussi was holding the original copy of the 'Damaged Samyeongdang's</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Bamboo Stick', and Kyungsein was holding 'Samyeongdang's Beads'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Even though I gave them each an item with magic resistance, it wasn't enough.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Still reeling from the shock of their Phantom Prison, Dansoo ahjussi grunted like a sick man,</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">while Kyung Sein crouched down and repeatedly asked not to hit her.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I sat next to them and wiped their sweaty foreheads.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein and Lee Dansoo.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">These were the people who proved their 'value' in the infamous first scenario.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">They weren't afraid to look at the corpses of people, and they fought bravely against those</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">terrifying ground rats.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe that's why I vaguely thought they would be okay.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 They're just ordinary readers. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't the monsters nor the killing, it was the reality they lived in that brought down those two</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">who stood up to the scenarios.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Ordinary people who were unfortunate enough to be transmigrated into this world. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I felt my heart grow cold again.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">What was I going to do with them? Was I going to raise them, soothe them, train them, and take</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">them on some exciting adventure?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein slowly opened her eyes and looked up at me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"U-uuh......?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">He[1] sat up shakily and looked around anxiously.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was as her tormentor was still lurking somewhere in the darkness.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I patted her on the back and said.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Sein-ssi, we've got all the Specters. We've recovered the Specter's Stones. You're safe now, just</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">breathe slowly."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who was breathing heavily, let out a slightly sobbing voice.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja...... went through something like this. He overcame something like this."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Clearly, Kim Dokja is a great person. The more time I spend in this world, the more I realize</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">that.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"You overcame it too, Sein-ssi."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein shook her head helplessly and asked.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you okay, Inho-ssi?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Fortunately."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"How did...... Do you really have a 'Fourth Wall' or something?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's just that my life didn't have many ups and downs. Ahjussi, are you awake?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Checking my face, Dansoo ahjussi burst into tears.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Alive."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know what he was dreaming about, but he grabbed my arm and wiped the tears away.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Hurry up...... Let's go to the next station."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know what he was dreaming about.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">But I know what he wanted to find in this world when he woke up.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"We're almost in Chungmuro. You'll find her soon enough."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Going to Chongmuro would start the third scenario, and once that was over, we would be able to</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">interact with the other stations in earnest.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">We'll find out Jiyoon's news soon enough.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't worry, I'll find her no matter what."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi nodded weakly.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Then let's get moving."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As I helped Dansoo ahjussi to his feet, Jung Heewon also helped Kyung Sein up.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Will it be okay? We should let them rest a little longer......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's better to rest when we get to the station. The tunnel is dangerous."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After only three stops, the two were exhausted.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who was walking beside me, asked in a small voice.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"You're not overdoing it, are you?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"No."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi's arms were damp with cold sweat.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I felt faintly dizzy, and I could smell blood somewhere.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Was this another Specter?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Or did I never escape from the 'Phantom Prison'?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait. There's something...... wrong."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi said hesitantly.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">There was a squishy feeling on my toes. When the smartphone's flash lit up on the floor, it</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">revealed a bloody railroad track. Strewn about were the bodies of neither man nor monster.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Ugh."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein held back her nausea and raised her shield, while Jung Heewon's expression</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">hardened and she grabbed the 'Damaged Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick' that was made with the</p>
<br>

<p class="orv_line">But there was no sign of [⬜⬜] being triggered yet.</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If the situation was truly dangerous, the color of the world would have changed first.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's move forward slowly. It's not too bad yet."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I took the lead and began to move forward, clearing the railroad tracks.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Some of the dead outer species on the ground looked familiar. They resembled the Ratmen we'd</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">encountered in the 'Edge of Darkness'. There were also some that resembled the reptilian</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">creatures Bang Cheolsoo had mentioned.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">There must have been some kind of war for so many of them to die at once.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Most of the bodies bore bullet holes.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Mate."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi called out to me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A light was shining some distance away.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Ugh, there."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As Kyung Sein spoke, a girl doll was seen under the dim light.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Long hair on a ponytail.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah......."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Kyung Sein saw her, she stopped dead in his tracks, as if she'd been electrocuted.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">And for good reason.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Running into that little girl was proof that we had finally arrived at Chungmuro.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk's first sword, and the incarnation of Maritime War God Yi Sunsin.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The only survivor of Daepong Girls' High School, Lee Jihye.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Wearing her trademark hood zipped-up, she stamped her foot on the railroad tracks and looked</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">toward Chungmuro Station.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon whispered.</p>
<br>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Not yet.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">[The compensation will be settled.]</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I tossed the reward message aside and looked back at the group.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll take the lead."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Neither Kyung Sein nor Dansoo ahjussi were in any condition to fight.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">For now, I must take the lead.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Just then, Lee Jihye, who was crossing her arms in the distance, looked over.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh? What's that?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye gripped the hilt of her sword, and Jung Heewon stepped forward as if to protect me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I approached with both my hands raised to show that I meant no hostility.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Hello. We're from Geumho Station."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"You can't go through here, so go back."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Look at that.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Another twist from the original.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"We have no ill intentions. We'd like to join Chungmuro. Can you please accept us?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">At this point, Chungmuro would be in the middle of the third scenario, 'Green Zone'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">'Green Zone' is a scenario in which you must occupy a 'Green Zone' on the station or be hunted</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">by monsters every night.</p>
<br>

<p class="orv_line">Since Lee Jihye is a rival of Gong Pildu, the ruler of Chungmuro Station, there was no reason for</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">her to stop us.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Master told me not to let anyone come here."</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk?</p>
<br>

<p class="orv_line">"Is Yoo Joonghyuk in Chungmuro?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you know my Master?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I do."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Then why didn't you say so earlier?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As Lee Jihye's eyes widened, she smiled and took a step closer.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Master told me to kill all the bastards who knew him."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-ssi!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time I shouted Jung Heewon's name instinctively, Lee Jihye's figure disappeared.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kagagagak!</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon's ground rat knife, which was imbued with [Kendo], accurately stopped Lee Jihye's</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Surprised, Lee Jihye muttered.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Wow, look at this unni."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Despite the fact that Jung Heewon's overall stats were higher than in the original, Lee Jihye and</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon were still neck and neck.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">This meant that Lee Jihye was also stronger than at the same point in the original.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-ssi! Buy me a few minutes! Please!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">At my shout, Jung Heewon threw something at me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Take this!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was the 'Damaged Samyeondang's Bamboo Stick' made by the 'Idea'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly snatched up the Bamboo Stick and said to the two people behind me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Stay here for a moment."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As I passed by, Lee Jihye shouted in a sharp voice.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey! Stop!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">According to the original, Chungmuro is currently on Day 2 of the 'Green Zone' scenario.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't odd for Yoo Joonghyuk to be in Chungmuro.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is that this is the unrivaled 41st turn Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I could hear a light explosion coming from Chungmuro Station.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I sped up my pace, shrugging off the ominous premonition. A dozen steps later, the Chungmuro</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">platform came into view.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The first thing I saw was a large hole in the center of the platform floor, and people hiding in the</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">stairwells and other places.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The terrified citizens were all looking at the two men who were fighting on the hole in the</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">platform.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">One, needless to say, was Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was the person on the other side.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Damn you. How dare you cross my land?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">You know the drill.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The short-tempered Yoo Joonghyuk has gotten into a fight with Gong Pildu.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, the fight doesn't seem to be a full-fledged fight yet, so there's still hope.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi, kill him quickly."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A boy's voice came from behind Gong Pildu.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, Gong Pildu nodded.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. I was about to."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if he's already made this area his [Private Property]. Mini-turrets rose from his</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Seven turrets in total.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was two more than in the 3rd turn of Omniscient Reader.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">But that's not enough to stop Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kooooo.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">This is because in the 40th turn, Yoo Joonghyuk is a monster that has already surpassed the</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">narrative-grade constellations.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The moment he holds the spear, Gong Pildu will certainly die.</p>
