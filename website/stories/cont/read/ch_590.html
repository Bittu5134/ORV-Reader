<p class="orv_line">&quot;I got creeped out, so I closed my eyes and swung at them, and they stopped.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at the crumpled Specter and sighed. Jung Heewon scolded me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You could have told me more beforehand.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It would have been nice, but I hated the fact that the moment I told her, I would have to explain</p>
<p class="orv_line">why I knew that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Once again, I felt the wisdom of Kim Dokja&#x27;s words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I didn&#x27;t know for sure either. What about the others?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I laid them over there.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I turned my head and saw Dansoo ahjussi stretched out and Kyung Sein curled up in a ball.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s been like that since earlier.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was surprised. Dansoo ahjussi was holding the original copy of the &#x27;Damaged Samyeongdang&#x27;s</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bamboo Stick&#x27;, and Kyungsein was holding &#x27;Samyeongdang&#x27;s Beads&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though I gave them each an item with magic resistance, it wasn&#x27;t enough.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still reeling from the shock of their Phantom Prison, Dansoo ahjussi grunted like a sick man,</p>
<p class="orv_line">while Kyung Sein crouched down and repeatedly asked not to hit her.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I sat next to them and wiped their sweaty foreheads.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein and Lee Dansoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">These were the people who proved their &#x27;value&#x27; in the infamous first scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They weren&#x27;t afraid to look at the corpses of people, and they fought bravely against those</p>
<p class="orv_line">terrifying ground rats.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe that&#x27;s why I vaguely thought they would be okay.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「They&#x27;re just ordinary readers.」</div>「They're just ordinary readers.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#x27;t the monsters nor the killing, it was the reality they lived in that brought down those two</p>
<p class="orv_line">who stood up to the scenarios.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Ordinary people who were unfortunate enough to be transmigrated into this world.」</div>「Ordinary people who were unfortunate enough to be transmigrated into this world.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt my heart grow cold again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What was I going to do with them? Was I going to raise them, soothe them, train them, and take</p>
<p class="orv_line">them on some exciting adventure?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein slowly opened her eyes and looked up at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;U-uuh......?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He[1] sat up shakily and looked around anxiously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was as her tormentor was still lurking somewhere in the darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I patted her on the back and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sein-ssi, we&#x27;ve got all the Specters. We&#x27;ve recovered the Specter&#x27;s Stones. You&#x27;re safe now, just</p>
<p class="orv_line">breathe slowly.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who was breathing heavily, let out a slightly sobbing voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Dokja...... went through something like this. He overcame something like this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Clearly, Kim Dokja is a great person. The more time I spend in this world, the more I realize</p>
<p class="orv_line">that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You overcame it too, Sein-ssi.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein shook her head helplessly and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you okay, Inho-ssi?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Fortunately.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How did...... Do you really have a &#x27;Fourth Wall&#x27; or something?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s just that my life didn&#x27;t have many ups and downs. Ahjussi, are you awake?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Checking my face, Dansoo ahjussi burst into tears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Alive.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know what he was dreaming about, but he grabbed my arm and wiped the tears away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hurry up...... Let&#x27;s go to the next station.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know what he was dreaming about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I know what he wanted to find in this world when he woke up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We&#x27;re almost in Chungmuro. You&#x27;ll find her soon enough.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Going to Chongmuro would start the third scenario, and once that was over, we would be able to</p>
<p class="orv_line">interact with the other stations in earnest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We&#x27;ll find out Jiyoon&#x27;s news soon enough.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;ll find her no matter what.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi nodded weakly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then let&#x27;s get moving.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I helped Dansoo ahjussi to his feet, Jung Heewon also helped Kyung Sein up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Will it be okay? We should let them rest a little longer.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s better to rest when we get to the station. The tunnel is dangerous.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">After only three stops, the two were exhausted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who was walking beside me, asked in a small voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;re not overdoing it, are you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi&#x27;s arms were damp with cold sweat.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Rice Cake-Eating Tiger&#x27; looks at the group worriedly.]</div>[The constellation 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger' looks at the group worriedly.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">Some readers may have encountered Specter in other regions.</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Nail-Eating Rat&#x27; watches you.]</div>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' watches you.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">If they died somewhere in this world, whose fault were their deaths?</p>

<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;There is no way such a villain exists in this world.&quot;」</div>「"There is no way such a villain exists in this world."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt faintly dizzy, and I could smell blood somewhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was this another Specter?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Or did I never escape from the &#x27;Phantom Prison&#x27;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait. There&#x27;s something...... wrong.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi said hesitantly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a squishy feeling on my toes. When the smartphone&#x27;s flash lit up on the floor, it</p>
<p class="orv_line">revealed a bloody railroad track. Strewn about were the bodies of neither man nor monster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ugh.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein held back her nausea and raised her shield, while Jung Heewon&#x27;s expression</p>
<p class="orv_line">hardened and she grabbed the &#x27;Damaged Samyeongdang&#x27;s Bamboo Stick&#x27; that was made with the</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Idea&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was no sign of [⬜⬜] being triggered yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the situation was truly dangerous, the color of the world would have changed first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s move forward slowly. It&#x27;s not too bad yet.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took the lead and began to move forward, clearing the railroad tracks.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Some of the dead outer species on the ground looked familiar. They resembled the Ratmen we&#x27;d</p>
<p class="orv_line">encountered in the &#x27;Edge of Darkness&#x27;. There were also some that resembled the reptilian</p>
<p class="orv_line">creatures Bang Cheolsoo had mentioned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There must have been some kind of war for so many of them to die at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Most of the bodies bore bullet holes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Mate.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi called out to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A light was shining some distance away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ugh, there.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Kyung Sein spoke, a girl doll was seen under the dim light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Long hair on a ponytail.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Kyung Sein saw her, she stopped dead in his tracks, as if she&#x27;d been electrocuted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And for good reason.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Running into that little girl was proof that we had finally arrived at Chungmuro.</p>

</div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The second &lt;Kim Dokja&#x27;s Company&gt; member I meet in the 41st turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s first sword, and the incarnation of Maritime War God Yi Sunsin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only survivor of Daepong Girls&#x27; High School, Lee Jihye.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wearing her trademark hood zipped-up, she stamped her foot on the railroad tracks and looked</p>
<p class="orv_line">toward Chungmuro Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon whispered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you know her?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I had to say something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;She&#x27;s the disciple of a bastard I know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that the indirect message came to mind.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Bald General of Justice&#x27; is touched at meeting an old companion.]</div>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is touched at meeting an old companion.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized that the same message was in the main story of Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was the message that came back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">dangerous here.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dangerous?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Main Scenario #2 - Meeting has ended.]</div>[Main Scenario #2 - Meeting has ended.]</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">[The compensation will be settled.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tossed the reward message aside and looked back at the group.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ll take the lead.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Neither Kyung Sein nor Dansoo ahjussi were in any condition to fight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For now, I must take the lead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just then, Lee Jihye, who was crossing her arms in the distance, looked over.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh? What&#x27;s that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye gripped the hilt of her sword, and Jung Heewon stepped forward as if to protect me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I approached with both my hands raised to show that I meant no hostility.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hello. We&#x27;re from Geumho Station.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You can&#x27;t go through here, so go back.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Look at that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Another twist from the original.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We have no ill intentions. We&#x27;d like to join Chungmuro. Can you please accept us?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this point, Chungmuro would be in the middle of the third scenario, &#x27;Green Zone&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Green Zone&#x27; is a scenario in which you must occupy a &#x27;Green Zone&#x27; on the station or be hunted</p>
<p class="orv_line">by monsters every night.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since Lee Jihye is a rival of Gong Pildu, the ruler of Chungmuro Station, there was no reason for</p>
<p class="orv_line">her to stop us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Master told me not to let anyone come here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is Yoo Joonghyuk in Chungmuro?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you know my Master?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I do.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then why didn&#x27;t you say so earlier?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Lee Jihye&#x27;s eyes widened, she smiled and took a step closer.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Master told me to kill all the bastards who knew him.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Heewon-ssi!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time I shouted Jung Heewon&#x27;s name instinctively, Lee Jihye&#x27;s figure disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kagagagak!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon&#x27;s ground rat knife, which was imbued with [Kendo], accurately stopped Lee Jihye&#x27;s</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surprised, Lee Jihye muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow, look at this unni.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Despite the fact that Jung Heewon&#x27;s overall stats were higher than in the original, Lee Jihye and</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon were still neck and neck.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This meant that Lee Jihye was also stronger than at the same point in the original.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Heewon-ssi! Buy me a few minutes! Please!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At my shout, Jung Heewon threw something at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Take this!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the &#x27;Damaged Samyeondang&#x27;s Bamboo Stick&#x27; made by the &#x27;Idea&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly snatched up the Bamboo Stick and said to the two people behind me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Stay here for a moment.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I passed by, Lee Jihye shouted in a sharp voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey! Stop!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to the original, Chungmuro is currently on Day 2 of the &#x27;Green Zone&#x27; scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#x27;t odd for Yoo Joonghyuk to be in Chungmuro.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is that this is the unrivaled 41st turn Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could hear a light explosion coming from Chungmuro Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sped up my pace, shrugging off the ominous premonition. A dozen steps later, the Chungmuro</p>
<p class="orv_line">platform came into view.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first thing I saw was a large hole in the center of the platform floor, and people hiding in the</p>
<p class="orv_line">stairwells and other places.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The terrified citizens were all looking at the two men who were fighting on the hole in the</p>
<p class="orv_line">platform.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One, needless to say, was Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was the person on the other side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Damn you. How dare you cross my land?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">You know the drill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The short-tempered Yoo Joonghyuk has gotten into a fight with Gong Pildu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, the fight doesn&#x27;t seem to be a full-fledged fight yet, so there&#x27;s still hope.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ahjussi, kill him quickly.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A boy&#x27;s voice came from behind Gong Pildu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, Gong Pildu nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. I was about to.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if he&#x27;s already made this area his [Private Property]. Mini-turrets rose from his</p>
<p class="orv_line">Seven turrets in total.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was two more than in the 3rd turn of Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that&#x27;s not enough to stop Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kooooo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because in the 40th turn, Yoo Joonghyuk is a monster that has already surpassed the</p>
<p class="orv_line">narrative-grade constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment he holds the spear, Gong Pildu will certainly die.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Luckily, the &#x27;Snowfield&#x27; was triggered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the image that went colorless, the mini-turret began charging, and Yoo Joonghyuk held the</p>
<p class="orv_line">spear handle in his hand.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">It was a close call.</p>
