            <div class="orv_title"><h1>688 Episode 23 Fragments of God (3)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">My open mouth could not be closed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">10 to 0?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Really? You won a 10-0 contract against that Bihyung?</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I looked up into the sky, I saw Bihyung sweating with a troubled expression on his face. It felt like he was having a conversation with someone, but it was obvious who it was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The conversation is over. Of course you know we are 10, right?</p>
<p class="orv_line">A hollow laugh came out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja was this kind of person.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'What on earth have you done?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">He placed me in the center of the battlefield, opened the Seoul Broadcasting channel, renewed the <stream contract>, and invited constellations to this channel.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A significant number of constellations are watching your movements!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[300 coins were sponsored.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">All of this happened in less than 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Are you ready?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realize once again who I signed with.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was once the swindler of this <Star Stream>.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The devil who mocked, despised, and saved the constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I have 5 minutes left to live.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Again, I wasn't afraid.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now I know why I am not afraid.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is with you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps I have been waiting for this moment all along.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Let’s begin the return stage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I ran with all my might, my 70-strong strength condensed and my acceleration increased.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'persistent martial arts master' begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As the story of the Ark was wrapped in my hands, my magic power, which had matured even further, drew blue in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The monsters' heads were blown away like toys in a straight trajectory.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Goryeo’s First Sword' nods to your martial arts.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Somehow, I felt like I was more accustomed to dealing with stories than before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this also the influence of my sponsor?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Oooooh!</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, an angry dragon howled and let out a bright red breath.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[5th grade monster dragon species, 'Variant Imoogi Bracky' prepares 'breath'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a monster species that did not appear in the main story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It’s literally just an Imoogi. Strictly speaking, it's not a proper 'dragon'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I have Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The breath pattern is vertical. Looking at the pattern on its back, it appears to be a lower class of the Fire Dragon and Earth Dragon. Maybe there are rocks mixed in between the breaths?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[5th grade monster dragon species 'Variant Imoogi Bracky' uses 'breath'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, large chunks of hail were mixed in between the flying breaths.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While watching the flying fireball, Kim Dokja calmly continued his explanation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The flames are clustered around the boulder, so you only need to dodge the big ones. Open your eyes straight, have you ever played a rhythm game?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I know what you want to say.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I think you're in the game now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was nonsense, but I actually did it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I bent down just in time for the hailstones to fly in, and I swung my [Unbreakable Faith] to blow up the small lumps that I was unable to avoid. Even though the heat exploded right in front of me, I didn’t look away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought I could do it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Okay, next!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I kicked off the floor at the signal and flew up, my eyes met in the air with Jung Heewon’s, who was dodging the breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before Jung Heewon, who was surprised to see me, could shout out anything, I pointed behind her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-ssi! Behind you!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The tail of the 4th grade dragon, who was looking for an opening, flew straight towards Jung Heewon. It was an attack with no apparent angle to avoid.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Don't worry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time as Kim Dokja's words, a dazzling aura rose from Jung Heewon's whole body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation 'Jung Heewon' activates 'Judgment Time'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A super-powerful skill that demonstrates omnipotent combat power against monsters.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Judgment Time, which only the 'Judge of Destruction' can use, has demonstrated its supernormal ability.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Hold on tight!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who snatched my hand, made abnormal movements in the air and fell to the ground.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the monster's tail narrowly passed by, Jung Heewon sighed and shouted while holding onto my wrist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"When did you wake up… No, rather, why did you come here! Do you know what the situation is now—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We’ll talk about that later. Heewon-ssi, if it were the current Heewon-ssi…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued speaking as I caught a glimpse of the 4th grade dragon, who was glaring at us after retracting his tail.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Can you deal with that guy?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if Kim Dokja was with me, it was impossible to hunt a 4th grade monster with my current specs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But for Jung Heewon, the story is different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She is a specialist in hunting big monsters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that [Judgment Time] has been activated, I might be able to fight against a 4th grade monster species.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"With that one thing, there’s no chance of winning."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The other thing is the problem."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said while looking at the 5th grade monster running towards me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will deal with the 5th grade. Heewon-ssi, please hold back the 4th grade."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait a minute, you’re so arrogant—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-ssi, you know very well what’s more important right now. If we don’t catch those monsters, everyone here will die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At my words, Jung Heewon hurriedly looked behind her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sergeant Kim retreated to the rear with Jung Eunho on his back. Bang Cheolsoo’s group was also seen protecting him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, frowning, let go of my wrist and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’ll ask a lot of questions later."</p>
<p class="orv_line">She ran straight towards the 4th grade monster. An Earth Dragon also swung its huge front paws at her as if it had been waiting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Immediately afterwards, a deafening roar erupted. If she were a normal incarnation, it would have been a blow that would have crushed her to the ground.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Jung Heewon endured.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Oooooh!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Body specifications increased significantly while passing through the seventh scenario. Plus the buffs of [Judgment Time] and [demon slaying].</p>
<p class="orv_line">If she was like that now, she wouldn't be defeated even if her opponent was Yoo Jonghyuk of the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I called out to Kim Dokja in my mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Hey, Kim Dokja-ssi.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know it's a fight so exciting that he won't be able to take his eyes off it, but he still has to do what he has to do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Oh sorry. It reminds me of the old days.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Old days.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't that difficult to think of what Kim Dokja, the 'Demon King of Salvation', might have thought while looking at Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'But now I have just three minutes left to live.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Don't worry. You won't die here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Do you really have to speak so ominously?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 5th grade dragon species that had prepared its attack rushed towards me once again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it was 5th grade, it was a level that couldn’t have been killed even if the readers and I launched a joint attack 45 days ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I used the 'Labyrinth Watcher' to buy time, and I was able to hunt the monster only after Dansu ahjussi died once and I also risked my life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Would I be able to kill such a monster alone?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Strictly speaking, it’s not a major character. At least it can't use techniques like 'total annihilation'. That's because it only activates in disaster scenarios.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Even if there's no such thing as annihilation, it doesn’t change that it’s strong.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You said your specs are enough for now? There's no time, so let's go quickly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had a clear idea in my head of what to do even if no one told me to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Sylphide's Leaping Boots.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The special option 'Leap' is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I soared up the body of the dragon in one go.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I activated the 'Blade of Faith' through 'Thoughts', the sword strike, which became even sharper due to the acceleration of [Leap], pierced the guy's spine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sensation of the blade entering was definitely different from the fourth scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I guess it's because my physical stats have improved significantly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahhh!</p>
<p class="orv_line">But this one blow wasn't enough to take him down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A more certain shot was needed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Use [Incite] and [Sentence Enhancement].</p>
<p class="orv_line">A combination of [Sentence Enhancement] and [Incite] that reinforce behavior. It was one of my few talents that [incited] me to become a specific character and used that character's power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Can I use Yoo Jonghyuk?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—How do you imitate Yoo Jonghyuk at your level now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'There have been times when I did it.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was true.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was short-lived and didn't go very well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The opponent is a monster species that evolved from an Imoogi. It’s obvious who to imitate, right?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Ah.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now it’s the seventh scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The number of stories I have is three.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Considering that one of them was 'semi-mythical', there was a character who I could have attempted to incite as even at my level.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even more so if that guy's body is an Imoogi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahhh!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The tip of its sharp claws scratched my thigh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suppressed the pain and activated [Sentence Enhancement].</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The sub-skill 'Sentence Enhancement' is activated!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can enter your actions.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The actions you enter will be reinforced.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[An error occurred!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently you cannot activate 'Sentence Enhancement'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[All probabilities needed to strengthen sentences have been exhausted!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I belatedly remembered the last time I activated the skill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that time, I had wasted all probability in signing a contract with the 'Demon King of Salvation' to kill the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I think I'm screwed.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It’s okay. You can at least use [Incite]!</p>
<p class="orv_line">'[Incite] cannot even imitate the character's skills.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It doesn’t matter, trust me! Hurry!</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.10' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I am-"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In my head, the pages of Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint began to turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is a being who can easily subdue the Imoogi in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellation that defeated Yamata no Orochi in the 'sixth scenario' in Peace Land.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am Kim Dokja, who defeated the 'Eight-Headed Snake' in 'Peace Land'!"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Incite' is pushed to its limit!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With the activation of [Incite], strong faith surged deep into my cells.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“I am Kim Dokja. I am the same Kim Dokja who hunted Yamata no Orochi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, the dragon species in front of me actually looked like nothing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's right, I hunted Yamata no Orochi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What's so scary about that 5th grade?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swung my sword at it with overflowing confidence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I can win. I can kill—</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kagaga!</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Blade of Faith' was easily blocked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy's huge maw opened before my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Quaaaaa!</p>
<p class="orv_line">I screamed as I hurriedly dodged the pouring breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I had just been hit by that, I would have died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I would’ve been really dead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Are you crazy? What if you run in there?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'No, you said to believe it!'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—There’s no way you can win with just [incite]! Give me 20,000 coins quickly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Yes—no, how much?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja had no answer. And.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Sponsor contract provisions is activated!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your constellation is extorting a portion of the donation amount scheduled for you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' acquired 20,000 coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">No, this guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja opened his mouth as if satisfied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Good. Let's get started</p>
<p class="orv_line">Let’s go.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' uses 20,000 coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, I realized what Kim Dokja was trying to do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He has now paid the directing fee.</p>
<p class="orv_line">20,000 coins is the minimum probability to put my 'fake acting' on the 'real stage'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'The One who Hunted the King of Disasters' begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The One who Hunted the King of Disasters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja's legendary story, a story obtained by cutting down Yamata no Orochi, who possesses the power of an Outer God.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That story was embedded in my whole body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[「Staging」 begins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The stage before my eyes began to change according to the influence of the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A part of Gwanghwamun's scenery was momentarily transformed into 'Veronica Castle', which was the stage of 'Peace Land'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently, the reproduction level of 'Staging' is low.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Although the level of reproduction was low because the opponent was not 'Yamata no Orochi', this was enough for now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Grrrr—!</p>
<p class="orv_line">As evidence, the momentum of 5th grade dragon species had clearly changed. Unlike before, its eyes showed a strange sense of fear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was natural.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is surprised by your story!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This story is a story of the murder of the 'King of Imoogis'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellations of the Balaur lineage are doubting the probability of the 'Demon King of Salvation'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire'’s eyes shine at your performance.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I ran out as if I were Kim Dokja from 'Peace Land'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A 5th grade dragon species opened its vicious maw as if it was about to bite me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Jump in!</p>
<p class="orv_line">With Kim Dokja's signal, I performed the mimicry of [Leap] and 'Thoughts' at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Change into the Everchanging Stealth suit.'</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The effect of the 'Everchanging Stealth Suit' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Just like when I entered the 'Star Jewel Dungeon', I used the 'Everchanging Stealth Suit' to reduce the size of my body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the panicked monster dragon species opened its mouth, I burst into its mouth like a small shooting star. As soon as I passed through the uvula and into the esophagus, Kim Dokja gave a signal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took off my stealth suit and put my hand into my chest. There was a real 'Unbreakable Faith' left behind by Han Sooyoung, who disappeared there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Help me, Han Sooyoung.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">I held the handle of the sword as if praying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's impossible on my own.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I also came here because of the story you wrote.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'The One who Hunted the King of Disasters' roars!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Shamelessly, I needed the power of that story one more time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Giiiiiiing!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Light exploded from 'Unbreakable Faith' and a powerful 'Blade of Faith' emerged.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The characteristic of [Circulatory Retardation] was activated and magical power was released like a waterfall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Stronger, faster.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' nods his head.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I can't be Kim Dokja, who killed the King of Disasters—but if I have the qualifications to be 'Kim Dokja' at all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If only I was still allowed that name.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「At that moment, I will not doubt that I am Kim Dokja.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The deep blue, white-blue magical power drew a dazzling trajectory.</p>
