            <div class="orv_title"><h1>737 Episode 29 Recorder of fear (4)</h1></div>
「For me, [Way of the Wind] has already been recorded.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered what that meant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since I am also a part of Kim Dokja, does this mean that Kim Dokja&#39;s story is sleeping within me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja had no talent for anything else, but he had a talent for storytelling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even when the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39; descended on me, he used that talent to fight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then why can’t I use [Way of the Wind]?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Several hypotheses came to mind, but the most reliable way to verify them was to ask the person making the statement directly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What does that mean?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lycaon, who had been groaning, slowly opened his mouth.</p>
【◼️◼️◼️ ◼️…】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A strong spark flew out along with the sound of Tsutsutsu. Lycaon frowned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this filtering as expected? I wondered when information I couldn&#39;t hear would come out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps it is related to the end of this world line. I don’t know how Lycaon knows that information, but…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lycaon thought for a moment and said this.</p>
【Student. It is reading records that have not yet been written. I could tell you, but now is not the time.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">To put it simply, it goes against probability.</p>
【As you know, the very fact that I am here now is against probability.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Not yet now. In the sky, the constellations of the Chinese zodiac were gathering together to hold a contest.</p>
[Some constellations belonging to the Nebula &lt;Zodiac&gt; are asking why that wolf does not return to the other world.]</p></div>
[Some constellations from the Nebula &lt;Zodiac&gt; request a &#39;probability suitability judgment&#39;.]</p></div>
[Some of the constellations of the Nebula &lt;Zodiac&gt; question whether it makes sense for an &#39;Outer God&#39; to intervene in the scenario.]</p></div>
[The Bureau is currently reviewing the matter.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">System messages emerging in real time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I wasn&#39;t particularly shaken or embarrassed.</p>
[The dokkaebi &#39;Bihyung&#39; admits that the existence of the Outer God is probable.]</p></div>
[Some constellations in the Nebula &lt;Zodiac&gt; question whether that makes sense.]</p></div>
[The management bureau certifies that there is no problem in the matter.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This was because Lycaon’s current existence did not conflict with the probability of &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
[A few constellations in the Nebula &lt;Zodiac&gt; are puzzled by the management bureau’s judgment.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It must be embarrassing for the constellations.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Reclining Dragon&#39; is observing you with curious eyes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If you think about common sense, their decision was right. Regardless of the status of the &#39;God of the Other World&#39;, it was improbable that the &#39;God of the Other World&#39; existed in only the eighth scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But they won&#39;t know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What kind of &#39;covenant&#39; did Lycaon and I make?</p>
[You have currently entered into an Outer World covenant with the &#39;Lost Guide&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A lost guide.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was the pseudonym of &#39;Lycaon Isparang&#39;, who became the god of another world.</p>
[The &#39;Otherworld Covenant&#39; you currently have with the &#39;Lost Guide&#39; is as follows.]</p></div>

<p>* The &#39;Lost Guide&#39;, a deity from another world, stays in &#39;Zone 13&#39; of the Recycling Center for a total of 30 days based on the &#39;lower floor of the Recycling Center&#39;.</p>
<p>* During the residency period, the &#39;Lost Guide&#39; will not directly interfere with the scenario.</p>
<p>* The &#39;Lost Guide&#39; will not protect you during your residency.</p>
<p>* While the &#39;Lost Guide&#39; resides in the area, you must supply him with the story of 「The Three Little Pigs」 in return.</p>
<p>* The &#39;Lost Guide&#39; can teach you and your companions [Way of the Wind] during your stay.</p>
<p>* Even if you do not master [Way of the Wind], the &#39;Lost Guide&#39; does not take any responsibility for this.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">This was the entire &#39;Otherworld Covenant&#39; I made with Lycaon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The summary of the contract was as follows.</p>
「For the next 30 days, Lycaon will exist as a &#39;wind doll&#39; next to me.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Aside from being able to teach me the [Way of the Wind], he can&#39;t help me at all, and he doesn&#39;t even protect me when the constellations attack.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, at the time of signing the contract, Lycaon asked this question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Student… Are you really a fanatic?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I answered with a grin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Anyway, it would be impossible to conclude a contract with other details.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Around the eighth scenario, I started to see something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are limits to the &#39;otherworldly covenant&#39; that can be made in a scenario of this scale.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Student will gain nothing by proceeding with this covenant. Considering student&#39;s talent, even learning the [Way of the Wind] is not guaranteed...</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It is a condition that was intentionally put in place. The more unfavorable the terms of the covenant are, the higher the probability that it will not go against probability.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you just read the contents, I really could have gained nothing from this covenant and ended up only losing my stake in the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it wasn&#39;t really that bad.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Instead, this condition must never be made known to the Constellations.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because that was the core of this &#39;otherworldly covenant&#39;.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Reclining Dragon&#39; realizes your trick and is amazed.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Abyssal Black Flame Dragon of the Abyss&#39; asks what is going on.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Reclining Dragon&#39; says it&#39;s not fun to say that.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It seems like Waryong noticed, but it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They can visit the &#39;Recycling Center&#39; because &#39;dragon&#39; is included in their modifier, but they will not interfere with the work of the &lt;Zodiac&gt;.</p>
[Some constellations from the Nebula &lt;Zodiac&gt; are targeting the &#39;Lost Guide&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lycaon, who had been silently receiving the constellations&#39; gaze, opened his mouth as if he belatedly realized something.</p>
【Student is still the same even if you are reincarnated. You are truly an exceptionally cowardly person.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I often hear compliments like that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">My strategy is simple.</p>
「Put up a ‘wind doll’ next to me, but don’t let anyone know it’s a &#39;wind doll&#39;.」</p></div>
【The covenant could have failed. Weren’t you afraid?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it was an &#39;otherworldly covenant&#39; with unfavorable conditions, if the dokkaebi in charge was a guy like &#39;Paul&#39;, my plan could have gone wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I thought it wouldn’t fail.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew right away that it was a local dokkaebi. And above all, this scenario area was the &#39;Recycling Center&#39;.</p>
[The &#39;Recycling Center Director&#39; is interested in your scheme.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Since the name was &#39;Recycling Center&#39;, I believed that the center director would not abandon the &#39;God of the Other World&#39;. Because the gods of the other world are the ones who need &#39;recycling&#39; more than any other material in this universe.</p>
[Some constellations belonging to the Nebula &lt;Zodiac&gt; disobey the management’s judgment…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It may seem noisy on the outside, but the cowardly constellations of the Chinese zodiac will not be able to interfere with Zone 13 for 30 days.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The group who had been practicing [Way of the Wind] returned to their lodgings one by one, and the sun began to set in Zone 13.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth as I noticed that the constellations from the Chinese Zodiac, who were venting their anger in the dark sky, were disappearing one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Lycaon. Let’s talk about the past for a moment.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it was time to bring up that story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was curious about other things, too, but I also wanted to know what happened to Lycaon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As far as I know, Lycaon went missing around the time the &#39;Disasters of Floods&#39; descended.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But how was it possible for Lycaon to become a &#39;God From Another World&#39; and descend to this world line?</p>
【That...】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If we figure out how he did that, we might be able to get clues about other enemies that exist in this world line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is that also a record that hasn’t been written yet?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lycaon seemed to think about it for a moment, but then he opened his mouth.</p>
【It&#39;s not a very interesting record, but if you don&#39;t mind.】</p></div>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The story returns to the &#39;Disaster Scenario&#39;, the fifth scenario of the 1,864th round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that time, Lycaon was swept away by the explosion of the &#39;Disaster of Questions&#39; while fighting with Antinus, the &#39;Queen of the Parasites&#39;, another guide.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lycaon, who lost consciousness, was mentally controlled by Antinus and was liberated after meeting Lee Gilyoung.</p>
「&quot;This is the first time I&#39;ve seen a bug like you! &quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After &#39;Antinus&#39; was eliminated by Lee Gilyoung, Lycaon&#39;s body began to die.</p>
「The &#39;Guide&#39; cannot bear the power of a disaster.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was due to the aftereffects of the explosion of the &#39;catastrophe meteorite&#39;. The durability of his body had reached its limit, but Lycaon struggled to survive somehow.</p>
「Your tale responds to your will.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As a result, Lycaon entered a new evolution. He had succeeded in taking a leap forward from being a &#39;5th grade alien species&#39;.</p>
「The new skill &#39;Restorative Predation&#39; has been acquired.」</p></div>
[Restorative Predation, which eats the bodies of other monster species and revitalizes their incarnation bodies.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Just then, the &#39;Flood Disaster&#39; began and the [Monster Gate] opened, and he was able to survive by eating the bodies of dead monsters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the wounds received from the &#39;disaster&#39; were not easily healed.</p>
【When I fully recovered, student had already entered the ninth scenario area.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Ninth scenario, &#39;Dark Castle&#39;.</p>
【I also followed student into the Dark Castle.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You were in the Dark Castle?&quot;</p>
【Yes.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, nowhere in 『Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint』 was there any information that Lycaon was there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did Han Sooyoung omit that information?</p>
【I only had a chance to meet student once...】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;When?&quot;</p>
【When student fought the &#39;Dream Eater&#39;, student couldn&#39;t see me, but I saw student.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Memories came to mind again and again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Dark Castle&#39;s 2nd floor. To save his mother Lee Sookyung, Kim Dokja fought alongside Yoo Jonghyuk against the &#39;Dream Eater&#39;.</p>
【Even now, the student of those days is vivid in my eyes.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lycaon&#39;s eyes twinkled dimly.</p>
【Some stories, regardless of their level, sometimes captivate your being just by watching them. If you are someone like me who doesn&#39;t have your own ◼️◼️, you are even more vulnerable to it.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Under the dazzling light of the mortal stars, Lycaon made a decision.</p>
【I thought that since student gave me enlightenment, I should also repay my debt.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait a minute, no way.&quot;</p>
【Yes. When student was swallowed up by the &#39;Dream Eater&#39;, I also entered into it.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you meet Kim Dokja there?&quot;</p>
【No, unfortunately I couldn&#39;t meet student. This is because the &#39;Dream Eater’s&#39; stomach was too wide.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Dream Eater&#39; is a powerful deity from another world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Its stomach was so large that it was located outside of outer space.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So, it was not strange that Lycaon and Kim Dokja could not meet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But the &#39;Dream Eater&#39; would have died in the end. No, not exactly—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I remember correctly, the &#39;Dream Eater&#39; is eventually absorbed into the [Fourth Wall] and becomes a librarian at the library.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Lycaon was inside the stomach of such a &#39;Dream Eater&#39;.</p>
【Yes. That was the problem. That&#39;s where the story gets a little complicated. I was trapped in the stomach of the &#39;Dream Eater&#39; who was eaten by the [Fourth Wall].】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, what…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was harsh. While trying to save Kim Dokja, he got trapped in the stomach of an Outer God.</p>
【I was trapped inside for a very long time.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;…Sorry.&quot;</p>
【I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re apologizing, but it wasn&#39;t a very bad time. I was able to watch your story through the tales read by the &#39;Dream Eater&#39;.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did I understand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason why he knows the story of Kim Dokja that he could never know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How long have you been there?&quot;</p>
【Until student saw the &#39;◼️◼️&#39; of everything.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then after that…&quot;</p>
【The &#39;Dream Eater&#39; realized my existence too late and released me.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When he was released, the world line&#39;s scenarios had ended.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The bureau collapsed and the story that bound him disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He, who had been the &#39;guide&#39; of the scenario, was no longer given a role. And the fate of those who lost their role in this world was determined.</p>
【It was an empty but common ending.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Most beings in this world die without even finding out what their ◼️◼️ is, let alone reaching it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lycaon suffered the same fate.</p>
【If only I hadn’t met that being.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was someone who took care of the dying Lycaon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He exists outside of the scenarios.</p>
「Like the &#39;Oldest Dream&#39;.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There Lycaon met one of the &#39;Great Old Ones&#39;.</p>
