            <div class="orv_title"><h1>756 Episode 32 Monkey King (3)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">The scenery of the cloud road flowed outside the window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someday, Kim Dokja must have seen the same scene. What was Kim Dokja thinking as he passed this road?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that time, Kim Dokja was riding with the symbolic form of Dionysus.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe he was too busy wondering whether the wine in Dionysus's cup was real.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The two didn't ask why I had Kim Dokja's face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as Kim Dokja did not ask whether the wine in Dionysus's cup was his urine or not.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All I hear in my ears is the squeak of rats running on the cloud road and the sound of the wind blowing gently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I slowly took my eyes off the window, I made eye contact with Cha Yerin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded and answered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm okay."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But it’s Kim Dokja's face."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason she immediately recognized this face was probably because it resembled Kim Dokja, who appeared on the cover of the original novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. This is Kim Dokja’s face."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like it was a stupid conversation, but I had no other way to respond. Because I really had Kim Dokja’s face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He’s more handsome than I thought."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"His assumption was correct."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kill… what did Seongwoo-ssi say?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja is not 'ugly' but 'ugly'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I belatedly remembered the nickname given to Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'The Ugliest King.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you think about it, the first title Kim Dokja received was not 'Demon King of Salvation' but 'The Ugliest King'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu, who was listening to the story nearby, asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What does that mean?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ugly is just being ugly, but 'ugly' means not fully formed."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aha."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a pretty subtle difference.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, from my point of view as the person who wrote that expression, I wonder what the specific intention was...</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if reading my thoughts, Ji Eunyu answered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But I don’t think there was any particular intention—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you talking about, editor? It was all perfectly intentional. Above all, Kim Dokja was blocked from external perception by the [Fourth Wall]! Other people couldn’t see Kim Dokja’s face properly!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">After hearing my explanation, Cha Yerin shook her head in admiration.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But even though there is a [Fourth Wall], I can still see the author’s face."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, I don’t have the [Fourth Wall]…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I spoke up to that point, I stopped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now I am the representative of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though the [Fourth Wall] was activated, there was nothing strange about it at all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Open up, Fourth Wall."</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no particular [Fourth Wall] response to my command.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu asked in a suspicious voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you do that, it will open?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I just gave it a try. But can you see my face clearly now?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. What about Yerin-ssi?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It looks good."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Does this mean that the [Fourth Wall] is not working properly?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The attributes' window cannot be activated due to a current system error.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, the 'attributes' window' is still not visible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu, who was quietly observing my face, continued speaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yerin-ssi, you said that the author looks like Kim Dokja right now, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s a little surprising. It doesn’t look that way to me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked, wondering what this was all about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"So how do you see it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It just looks like the original author’s face."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"My face?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s not exact, but I think so. Author, didn’t you always look like this? Your hair style is very different, but…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a question that immediately came to mind.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「What did I originally look like?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Has it been too long since I possessed a character? Even when I saw my face reflected in the window and touched it again, my old face did not come to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It feels like my face has been like this from the beginning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt scared for a moment because of that sentiment, which did not feel the slightest sense of discomfort.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't tell these two people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'story' I have is said to be eating up 'Kim Dokja’s fragments', and to the extent that I have eaten those fragments, I am becoming more like Kim Dokja.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' opens its eyes greedily.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even now, my story is coveting the two people in front of me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「If you touch either of them, I will never speak of you again.」</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' frowns and steps away.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, the story quickly quieted down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, in that short period of time, there were people who witnessed the altercation between me and my story.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I never thought there would be someone who waslike us in this universe.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was Meihouwang. Meihouwang delivered his mantra in the form of a telephonic voice so that the other two could not hear it.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[When one being becomes many, problems arise. Get your mind straight. If you don’t want to be preyed upon by 'just one story'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Just one story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't expect to hear these words here, so I suddenly looked at him. However, Meihouwang seemed to have no intention of saying more, and he yawned repeatedly, hiding his bored expression.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Wake me up when you arrive.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Meihouwang soon took a deep breath and fell asleep in Ji Eunyu's arms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And as soon as he fell asleep, a small display appeared above the carriage window.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Welcome aboard the 'Orient Express Wagon'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it was just a golden carriage, but the internal facilities are state-of-the-art. Well, I should have looked into it from the moment the fragment of the 「fingerprint recognition」 story was attached.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The carriage traveling on the cloudy road felt like it was tilting for a moment.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[After a while, the carriage changes to 'manual operation'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">No, suddenly?</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as the message ended, a controller appeared out of thin air. It was the same controller we commonly use when playing games.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Zodiac Ball' participants must operate the 'controller' to drive the carriage themselves.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The destination is displayed on the panel.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You may attack or be attacked by another carriage on the way to your destination.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Special prizes will be awarded to the passengers of the carriage that reach the destination in first place.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, a huge panel appears before my eyes. There was a dot on the panel marking the location of our carriage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In addition to us, what appeared to be carriages were moving nearby.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe there's a carriage with Killer King or Lee Dansu among them.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[After 30 seconds, 'manual driving' will begins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">30 seconds. There isn't much time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly looked back at Ji Eunyu and opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Editor-nim."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. Are you asking me to knock you out?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know how Ji Eunyu knew, but she was already pulling out a large hammer from her pocket.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cha Yerin also said, clashing her iron fists together.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If it’s about knocking someone out, I’m good at it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at them for a moment and then answered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’ll just do it myself."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was lucky that this wasn't 'Zone 13'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because from now on, I can freely use skills.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m going to pass out for 30 seconds from now."</p>
<br>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This area is a place where 'skill' use is permitted.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv. 10' is activated!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your understanding of the story fragment 'Incite' is very excellent.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story fragment 'Incite' has a great influence on the proficiency of skill 'Incite'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With the feeling of my consciousness sinking, I activated [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint].</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' stage 2 is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Let's see.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Let’s check Yoo Jonghyuk’s side first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I thought of Yoo Jonghyuk, the boy from the 41st round, in my head, the inside of another carriage appeared before my eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"That guy must be in a carriage too."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The conditions for activating the skill have been met. It seems he also thought of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the one who rode with Yoo Jonghyuk—</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「'If you say that guy, do you mean Kim Dokja?"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Damn it, why is it Killer King?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy Yoo Jonghyuk and Killer King were staring at each other while sitting across from each other in the carriage.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Why do you call Kim Dokja 'that guy'?"」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"It’s what feels right in my heart."」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Only close friends use that title. You and Kim Dokja are not close. It's actually me who is close."」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"You don't seem that close either."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The two growled as if they were going to fight at any moment, and then looked at the controller that appeared in the air and spoke at the same time.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"I'll do it."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately switched the screen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It would have been a lie if I said we weren't there, but after thinking about it, I thought there wouldn't be that much of a problem if these two were a team.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's because Yoo Jonghyuk's characteristic was that he was a pro gamer, and Killer King was also talented at games.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was with the other team.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Aaaah! Dokja-ssi, what should I do? What should I do!"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Cruelly,Kyung Sein was already calling my name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Next, the sacrificial face of Lee Dansu appeared before my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, Kyung Sein and Dansu ahjussi were on the same team.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I used [group chat] to talk to them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—  Have either of you played a game before?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, Dansu ahjussi and Kyung Sein looked up into the sky at the same time.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Wow, is this really what Kim Dokja  is talking about? Is this [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint]?"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">—Yes. Please let me know quickly as we are running out of time.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Hmm, I haven't had any talent for games since I was young—"」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Well, I like games, but I’m not good at controlling them… so my friends don’t always join me…"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Damn, it seemed like that too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, several other carriages were approaching the carriage they were riding in. No matter how I looked at it, it didn't seem like they were approaching with good intentions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Be careful!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The window of the carriage running side by side opened and a barrage of sharp shuriken flew in.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Waaaaaaah!"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The shurikens scraped against the carriage with a crunching sound. At a glance, it was an attack filled with powerful magical power.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The durability of the carriage has decreased!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't leave it like this.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There are 10 seconds left to stay in a stunned state .]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I made a quick decision.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will pass out for one more minute."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv. 10' is activated!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Stun time is extended!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The usage time of the exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' stage 2, is extended!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">—Hold your controller! Hurry!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein grabbed the controller and attempted to accelerate. The distance between the carriages did not increase. Rather, the carriages naturally surrounded them as if they were playing a game.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the shurikens flew in from both sides and scratched the wheels of the carriage, the inside of the carriage shook as if it would overturn at any moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The screams of Kyung Sein and Dansu ahjussi were heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, pale smoke began to rise from the front of the carriage.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Warning! The carriage's durability is below 20%!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As the carriage slowed down, other carriages passed them mockingly. Fortunately, it appears that they did not intend to finish off the carriage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, those carriages seem strangely fast—</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Liverless Rabbit' is grinning.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story fragment 'Running Rabbit' begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The carriage receives acceleration correction from the story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Damn it, it had to be the carriage with the 'Rabbit' version.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Other carriages nearby also passed their  carriage.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Warning. The carriage of incarnation that arrives last at the 'destination' cannot enter the 'Zodiac Ball'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The expressions of Kyung Sein and Dansu ahjussi hardened at the message they heard.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[All passengers on a carriage that does not arrive at the 'destination' will die.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">These were the rules of this game.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is a game in which incarnations who do not reach the destination are 'certainly destined to die'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was the 'Orient Express Carriage'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And if things continue like this, there is a high probability that Dansu ahjussi and Kyung Sein’s carriage will not be able to avoid last place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth urgently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Ahjussi, use a story.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"If it’s a story—"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">—Have you forgotten what 'animal mask' you are wearing?</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, Dansu ahjussi’s eyes widened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansu finally realized it too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An animal that runs slowly but steadily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And at least an animal that doesn't lose to 'rabbits'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You might not know this from other Chinese zodiac signs, but no matter what happens, the turtle never loses to the rabbit.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"But will the stage work properly?"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">—Of course. Because.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because the conditions for staging this story have just been met.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story fragment 'The Turtle Incubating Someone Else’s Egg' begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story fragment 'The Turtle Incubating Someone Else’s Egg' encounters the story 'Running Rabbit'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'The Hare and the Tortoise' begins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Along with the unfolding stage scene, the carriage's durability gauge began to rise little by little.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'The Hare and the Tortoise' repairs the 'Orient Express Wagon'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The speed of the carriage was also gradually increasing. A carriage that moves steadily at an honest but regular pace.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before I knew it, the carriages that had passed ahead began to come into view.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Okay, okay! I'm really catching up!"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Done. Now, as long as you drive well, this carriage will reach its destination without any problems.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Hmm."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The voice that suddenly came was not that of Dansu ahjussi or that of Kyung Sein.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it because I'm too focused on the external situation? I didn't notice that there was a passenger in their carriage with  them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I looked closely, I saw that the passenger was someone I knew.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"You."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Dongzhongshang</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"You can already use the power of the oldest dream."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He opened his mouth as if he could see me floating in the air.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"But you’d better not abuse that power."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">How did Dongzhongshang notice that I was here?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bicheonhori silently pointed his finger behind me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Dokja-ssi."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Someone's voice coming from behind, from very far away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A voice that seems to place a heavy weight on the heart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Right. [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] was this skill. That,</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Dokja hyung!"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a curse.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Ahjussi!"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">They were calling me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dongzhongshang smiled as if he wanted to see that.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"You can’t become a 'recorder' yet. With so many voices holding onto you, how can you write the next story of this world?"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even after hearing those words, I couldn't help but look back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now I am the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because it was a constellation that loved stories more than anyone else in this world.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Kim Dokja."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I looked back, the scenery of the story changed once again.</p>
