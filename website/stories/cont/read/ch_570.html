<p class="orv_line">"They say there's nothing ahead."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thanks to the cockroaches' forewarning of danger, we were able to move at a faster pace than before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein said admiringly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The cockroaches are so OP."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What's OP?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That...... It's too good, so maybe your sponsor is more useful than I thought?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' grumbles asking 'Did you realize that just now?']</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Things certainly weren't bad.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this point, Dansoo ahjussi could easily play the role of Lee Gilyoung in the main story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We walked for about ten minutes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He stopped for the first time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There's something up ahead."</p>
<p class="orv_line">We gasped in unison.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A few cockroaches scurried toward him, their antennae twitching violently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I think it's one ground rat."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't think there were ground rats in this section.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a moment and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's wait, maybe it's one that got separated from the mischief and is wandering around."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't want to risk an encounter. We waited, hiding ourselves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ground rat showed no sign of going away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi looked a little tired, as if he'd used [Diverse Communication] too many times in such a short period of time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What shall we do?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Oksu Station was just around the corner. It would be a shame to turn back here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's catch it, it's only one."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein suggested first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We have to fight at some point, and we can't go through the scenario without catching one. It's a monster that Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung also caught, so let's not be scared."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Turns out she was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lightly stretching her shoulders and neck, Kyung Sein continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you have any useful skills, show them all instead of hiding them. For reference, I have [Average Correction]."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, I thought that if she was a complete reader, she would have at least one hidden hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, [Average Correction].</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's a skill that wasn't detailed in Omniscient Reader, but I remembered setting it up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's a little tricky to explain, but if you raise one of your stats, the rest of your stats will be corrected to 70% of your highest stats. For example, if you raise your physique level to 10, you'll have a performance level of 7 without leveling up strength or agility."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh, that's a pretty cool skill."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely a powerful skill. It meant that from now on, Kyung Sein could go all-in on just one main stat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the early stages, when coins are hard to come by for stats, there's no better skill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I only have the [Diverse Communication] I showed you earlier....... What about my mate?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I checked my skills one by one.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[■■]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Character List]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incite]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">These were the only three skills I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sometimes I hear a character's inner thoughts, so I think there's a skill that's similar to [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint], but I haven't figured out how to activate it yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Unfortunately, my skills are all related to inciting through speech. As you can see, it's Cheon Inho."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Phew, it can't be helped, but it's not a bad situation. There are three of us and one of it, so on the signal of one, two, three, we'll all run and beat it up."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's be careful not to get hurt."</p>
<p class="orv_line">We looked at each other and cautiously approached the ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We must have taken thirty steps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The shadow of a monster emerged from the darkness.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The size of a fully-grown wolf. A mole-like creature with developed forepaws. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was no mistaking it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a 9th grade underground species, the ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But...... Was it that big?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uh, wait a minute."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein also stopped walking as if she noticed something strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kooooo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An ominous howl.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A pair of yellow eyes glowed in the darkness, and a boar-like creature charged toward us. The ground rumbled lightly, and stones bounced off the bottom of the track.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The frail Kim Dokja had actually caught a monster like this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hiyoooop!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi let out a strange shout and swung his pipe in an excited gesture.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But his weak pipe grazed the ground rat's face and bounced off.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi barely rolled out of the way of the collision.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was next.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Despite this, my strength level is 10. There's no way I can't catch a monster that even a kid like Lee Gilyoung could catch.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swung the pipe with all my might, but it missed. The moment the blow hit, the ground rat quickly lowered its head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Oops.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I spun around and landed on my butt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I quickly raised my head, the ground rat was running past me toward the target. It had instinctively chosen the weakest-looking prey among us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sein-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The terrified Kyung Sein held up her pipe, her arms shaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uh, Uwaaaak!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Throwing the pipe, Kyung Sein turned around and started running.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you doing! Catch it!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"H-How can I catch something like that!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">What a difference between fiction and reality.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is that really the same beast that Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung fought?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who was running fast, tripped over the tracks and fell. The ground rat didn't miss the opportunity, howled, and hit her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a thud, she bounced off and hit the wall of the train tracks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought she was dead, but to my surprise, Kyung Sein staggered to her feet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uaaaa! It hurts! It hurts!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason was obvious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein had gone all-in on her physique.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as I had invested my coins in strength, she had invested all of her coins in physique.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't run, pick up your weapon! Over here! You bastard!"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.2' is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I activated [Incite] half-heartedly, and it turned to look in my direction. It didn't seem to understand me, but at least I'd turned off its aggression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With Kyung Sein haphazardly picking up her weapon, Dansoo ahjussi and I formed a chaotic formation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, the ground rat only let out a snarl and didn't try to charge again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You said you were going to be a man worthy of Heewon-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-nim is strong, I can help her as a wife!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You've killed people, you can't just run away like that."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wish I hadn't said that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Pale and fed up, Kyung Sein asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I killed a man? Who told you that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I...... I just closed my eyes and finished the kid Heewon-nim left half dead."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I watched Kyung Sein's shaking hand holding the pipe, it all made sense.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was why Jung Heewon had such a strong expression on her face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you really don't want to die, make up your mind."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The plan was a complete failure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no way an ordinary reader in real life could possess someone in a novel and suddenly start acting like Kim Dokja.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I wonder how many of them survived. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Just as the sudden anxiety was taking over my mind, Dansoo ahjussi called out to me in a trembling voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I-Inho-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ground rat that had been confronting us had four eyes now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He'd called for his colleague.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Turn around."</p>
<p class="orv_line">We started running toward Geumho Station. But the chasing ground rats were faster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi! Hurry!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi, who has relatively low physique and strength, lagged behind. I slowed down a bit to keep pace with him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's when I heard a squeak. I looked to the side and saw a ground rat nibbling at the hem of my clothes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed to be bleeding profusely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't believe I was going to die like this, not from a monster, but from an earth rat. At the same time, I realized that I wanted to write a novel about this story.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The Ultimate Omniscient Reader Party. Wiped out by a 9th grade underground species, the ground rat. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But who would read such a novel?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I let out a shout and smashed the ground rat's head with my pipe. But its grip was stronger than I thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi! Run! Come on!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I can't take on both of them with all my might now. It's even more impossible for me alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At least I can buy some time.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.2' is strongly activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My skill once again drew the attention of the ground rats.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I gripped the pipe with both hands like a baseball bat and slammed it into the side of one of them. It squirmed in pain and fell from me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was the other one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In an ominous flash of foreboding, a large shadow leaped up behind me. It was too late to react.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Get out of the way!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a sharp voice, a pipe flew out of nowhere and pierced the ground rat's eye.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kuaaaak!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sharpened end of the pipe went straight through the ground rat's skull and out the other side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The pipe was pulled straight out and left an efficient trajectory toward the second ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew the identity of that trace.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A skill that was dismissed as insignificant in Omniscient Reader.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Kendo(劍道)]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, there were some characters who practiced it to the limit and finally slit the throats of demons.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The flowing trace of the pipe sliced through the head of the staggering second ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As it collapsed, the red glow extinguished from its eyes as it looked at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I knew this would happen."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Last time, I thought I couldn't help it even if Ji Eunyoo teased me. This time, I thought I might actually fall in love with her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Jung Heewon.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Sniff sniff, Heewon unni, I mean, it was so hard for us."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein held on to Jung Heewon and sobbed for a long time. I thought I was really going to die. Why did she come now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thanks to you, I'm alive. I didn't know they were so strong......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi also thanked her, exhausted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I did the same.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You saved my life, you really put up a good fight."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are your wounds okay?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. It's nothing, thankfully."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, the ground rat's teeth had only scratched my side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, if Jung Heewon hadn't come, I would have died there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I completely miscalculated our power. I didn't expect the readers party to be so crappy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I came here because I was worried. I saw two weak men and a small girl leaving as a scouting party..... I was honestly nervous."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, Jung Heewon was the only one who objectively grasped our party's strength.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the previous battle was surprising even when I thought about it again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was this strong.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Character List' is activated!]</p></div>

</div>
<p class="orv_line">I can't believe that 'Cheon Inho' is trusted by Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Life really is hard to understand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But why did you move in such a hurry?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon's question made Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi look at me at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Because we have to rescue the survivors."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Survivors?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There's someone I know near Oksu Station."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon nodded as if she understood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I see. Your parents, your family?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If I had to say...... They're like family."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi looked at me and nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If that's the case, I'll help you too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'd really appreciate it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it would be okay to go with Jung Heewon. She was going to be a main member of Kim Dokja's Company, so there was no harm if she accompanied us in advance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there was something I needed to do before I left again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at the bodies of the two fallen ground rats.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hmm? What are you going to do?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were two main reasons why our party was so unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One, the lack of main combat skills, and two.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's make weapons."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if something had come to their mind, Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi jumped out of their seats.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It must have been the development of the main story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Kyung Sein's expression brightened for a moment, and then quickly darkened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But...... Inho-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you know how to do it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was the problem.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Ground rat's spine sword! Ground rat's spine sword!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein had been repeating the words like a mantra for several minutes now, holding the head of a ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you doing?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm trying to do something."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I think she has watched too many cartoons.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I left Kyung Sein alone and took out the knife I had borrowed from the Cheoldoo Group earlier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then I used Incite on myself.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv2' is activated!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 This isn't gross at all. I'm a professional butcher. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I grabbed the ground rat by the head and started tearing off its skin. Honestly, I was worried because I've never done any butchering before, but it wasn't as hard as I thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Upon closer inspection, I realized that the skin had a dotted line along the spine. Like a creature made to be cut along the dotted line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought that this was enough for people who hadn't read 'Ways of Survival' like Kim Dokja, then I turned to the side and saw Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi gagging.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Oh well, that's normal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, on the other hand, stuck to my side and watched the whole grooming process with interest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Where did you learn to do this?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Self-taught."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wow......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">My shoulders got tense for no reason.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I must be pretty talented, right? Jung Heewon added with a wry smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But since you're self-taught, you're not very good at it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't bully me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grunted for about twenty minutes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a snap, the first ground rat's spine was cleanly separated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi was impressed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Now that's a convincing one."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in their natural state, the vertebrae of ground rats resembled a sword. Indeed, a creature that defied evolutionary odds to have a spine made by a single bone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This is for Heewon-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Really? Can I take it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Because you're our team's biggest power."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was a monster who could beat two ground rats with a pipe, and then I gave her a ground rat knife?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's only a matter of catching the bus from now on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah...... Thank you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon accepted the knife as if she was embarrassed, and then examined the front and back of the knife for a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Suddenly I feel like I'm back in the Paleolithic age."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stopped and looked up. I thought it sounded familiar, but then I realized it was a line from Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hesitated for a moment.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 May I answer? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I inhaled lightly, then spoke in a somewhat theatrical tone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You need to grind it a bit more for it to be useful. There are rocks around so skillfully grind the blade."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh, understood, Captain."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Originally, this conversation had been between Kim Dokja and Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who came up behind them, scolded me with a whisper.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't you think you're getting too close to Heewon-nim?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, someone has to look out for her. Until we meet Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I said that, my heart gradually grew heavy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if I could do as much as Kim Dokja did.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Would I be able to help Jung Heewon survive in this world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"By the way, there's a problem. Heewon-nim won't be able to grow as fast as things are going now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if reading my mind, Kyung Sein whispered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You remember that? Heewon-nim, gets stronger for real after her awakening as the 'Judge of Destruction'. At this rate, even if we meet the real Kim Dokja, Heewon-nim may not be as active as she was in the main novel."</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon's strongest skill is [Hour of Judgement].</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order to obtain it, she must become the 'Judge of Destruction'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there are two prerequisites for her to do so.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One is that she is subjected to brutal violence by the Cheoldoo Group.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And two.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"In order for Heewon-nim to awaken as in the original, Cheon Inho-ssi must die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">My death.</p>
