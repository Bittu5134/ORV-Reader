<p class="orv_line">Things certainly weren&#x27;t bad.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this point, Dansoo ahjussi could easily play the role of Lee Gilyoung in the main story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We walked for about ten minutes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He stopped for the first time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There&#x27;s something up ahead.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We gasped in unison.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A few cockroaches scurried toward him, their antennae twitching violently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think it&#x27;s one ground rat.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t think there were ground rats in this section.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a moment and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s wait, maybe it&#x27;s one that got separated from the mischief and is wandering around.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t want to risk an encounter. We waited, hiding ourselves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ground rat showed no sign of going away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi looked a little tired, as if he&#x27;d used [Diverse Communication] too many times in</p>
<p class="orv_line">such a short period of time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What shall we do?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Oksu Station was just around the corner. It would be a shame to turn back here.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s catch it, it&#x27;s only one.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein suggested first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We have to fight at some point, and we can&#x27;t go through the scenario without catching one. It&#x27;s a</p>
<p class="orv_line">monster that Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung also caught, so let&#x27;s not be scared.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Turns out she was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lightly stretching her shoulders and neck, Kyung Sein continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you have any useful skills, show them all instead of hiding them. For reference, I have</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, I thought that if she was a complete reader, she would have at least one hidden</p>
<p class="orv_line">hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, [Average Correction].</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s a skill that wasn&#x27;t detailed in Omniscient Reader, but I remembered setting it up.</p>

<p class="orv_line">corrected to 70% of your highest stats. For example, if you raise your physique level to 10, you&#x27;ll</p>
<p class="orv_line">have a performance level of 7 without leveling up strength or agility.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh, that&#x27;s a pretty cool skill.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely a powerful skill. It meant that from now on, Kyung Sein could go all-in on just</p>
<p class="orv_line">one main stat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the early stages, when coins are hard to come by for stats, there&#x27;s no better skill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I only have the [Diverse Communication] I showed you earlier....... What about my mate?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I checked my skills one by one.</p>

<p class="orv_line">These were the only three skills I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sometimes I hear a character&#x27;s inner thoughts, so I think there&#x27;s a skill that&#x27;s similar to</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Unfortunately, my skills are all related to inciting through speech. As you can see, it&#x27;s Cheon</p>
<p class="orv_line">Inho.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Phew, it can&#x27;t be helped, but it&#x27;s not a bad situation. There are three of us and one of it, so on the</p>
<p class="orv_line">signal of one, two, three, we&#x27;ll all run and beat it up.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s be careful not to get hurt.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">We looked at each other and cautiously approached the ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We must have taken thirty steps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The shadow of a monster emerged from the darkness.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The size of a fully-grown wolf. A mole-like creature with developed forepaws.」</div>「The size of a fully-grown wolf. A mole-like creature with developed forepaws.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no mistaking it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a 9th grade underground species, the ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But...... Was it that big?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Uh, wait a minute.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein also stopped walking as if she noticed something strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kooooo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An ominous howl.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A pair of yellow eyes glowed in the darkness, and a boar-like creature charged toward us. The</p>
<p class="orv_line">ground rumbled lightly, and stones bounced off the bottom of the track.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The frail Kim Dokja had actually caught a monster like this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hiyoooop!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi let out a strange shout and swung his pipe in an excited gesture.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But his weak pipe grazed the ground rat&#x27;s face and bounced off.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ahjussi!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi barely rolled out of the way of the collision.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was next.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Despite this, my strength level is 10. There&#x27;s no way I can&#x27;t catch a monster that even a kid like</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Gilyoung could catch.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swung the pipe with all my might, but it missed. The moment the blow hit, the ground rat</p>
<p class="orv_line">quickly lowered its head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Oops.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I spun around and landed on my butt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I quickly raised my head, the ground rat was running past me toward the target. It had</p>
<p class="orv_line">instinctively chosen the weakest-looking prey among us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sein-ssi!&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The terrified Kyung Sein held up her pipe, her arms shaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Uh, Uwaaaak!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Throwing the pipe, Kyung Sein turned around and started running.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you doing! Catch it!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;H-How can I catch something like that!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">What a difference between fiction and reality.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is that really the same beast that Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung fought?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who was running fast, tripped over the tracks and fell. The ground rat didn&#x27;t miss</p>
<p class="orv_line">the opportunity, howled, and hit her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a thud, she bounced off and hit the wall of the train tracks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought she was dead, but to my surprise, Kyung Sein staggered to her feet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Uaaaa! It hurts! It hurts!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason was obvious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein had gone all-in on her physique.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as I had invested my coins in strength, she had invested all of her coins in physique.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#x27;t run, pick up your weapon! Over here! You bastard!&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill &#x27;Incite Lv.2&#x27; is activated.]</div>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.2' is activated.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I activated [Incite] half-heartedly, and it turned to look in my direction. It didn&#x27;t seem to</p>
<p class="orv_line">understand me, but at least I&#x27;d turned off its aggression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With Kyung Sein haphazardly picking up her weapon, Dansoo ahjussi and I formed a chaotic</p>
<p class="orv_line">formation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, the ground rat only let out a snarl and didn&#x27;t try to charge again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You said you were going to be a man worthy of Heewon-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Heewon-nim is strong, I can help her as a wife!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;ve killed people, you can&#x27;t just run away like that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wish I hadn&#x27;t said that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Pale and fed up, Kyung Sein asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I killed a man? Who told you that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Heewon-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I...... I just closed my eyes and finished the kid Heewon-nim left half dead.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I watched Kyung Sein&#x27;s shaking hand holding the pipe, it all made sense.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was why Jung Heewon had such a strong expression on her face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you really don&#x27;t want to die, make up your mind.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The plan was a complete failure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no way an ordinary reader in real life could possess someone in a novel and suddenly</p>
<p class="orv_line">start acting like Kim Dokja.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I wonder how many of them survived.」</div>「I wonder how many of them survived.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as the sudden anxiety was taking over my mind, Dansoo ahjussi called out to me in a</p>
<p class="orv_line">trembling voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I-Inho-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ground rat that had been confronting us had four eyes now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He&#x27;d called for his colleague.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Turn around.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We started running toward Geumho Station. But the chasing ground rats were faster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ahjussi! Hurry!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi, who has relatively low physique and strength, lagged behind. I slowed down a</p>
<p class="orv_line">bit to keep pace with him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s when I heard a squeak. I looked to the side and saw a ground rat nibbling at the hem of my</p>
<p class="orv_line">clothes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed to be bleeding profusely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#x27;t believe I was going to die like this, not from a monster, but from an earth rat. At the</p>
<p class="orv_line">same time, I realized that I wanted to write a novel about this story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">ground rat.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">But who would read such a novel?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I let out a shout and smashed the ground rat&#x27;s head with my pipe. But its grip was stronger than I</p>
<p class="orv_line">thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ahjussi! Run! Come on!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I can&#x27;t take on both of them with all my might now. It&#x27;s even more impossible for me alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At least I can buy some time.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill &#x27;Incite Lv.2&#x27; is strongly activated!]</div>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.2' is strongly activated!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">My skill once again drew the attention of the ground rats.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I gripped the pipe with both hands like a baseball bat and slammed it into the side of one of</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">them. It squirmed in pain and fell from me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was the other one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In an ominous flash of foreboding, a large shadow leaped up behind me. It was too late to react.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Get out of the way!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a sharp voice, a pipe flew out of nowhere and pierced the ground rat&#x27;s eye.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kuaaaak!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sharpened end of the pipe went straight through the ground rat&#x27;s skull and out the other side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The pipe was pulled straight out and left an efficient trajectory toward the second ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew the identity of that trace.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A skill that was dismissed as insignificant in Omniscient Reader.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Kendo(劍道)]</div>[Kendo(劍道)]</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there were some characters who practiced it to the limit and finally slit the throats of</p>
<p class="orv_line">demons.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The flowing trace of the pipe sliced through the head of the staggering second ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As it collapsed, the red glow extinguished from its eyes as it looked at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I knew this would happen.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Last time, I thought I couldn&#x27;t help it even if Ji Eunyoo teased me. This time, I thought I might</p>
<p class="orv_line">actually fall in love with her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you okay?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">*.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sniff sniff, Heewon unni, I mean, it was so hard for us.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein held on to Jung Heewon and sobbed for a long time. I thought I was really going to</p>
<p class="orv_line">die. Why did she come now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thanks to you, I&#x27;m alive. I didn&#x27;t know they were so strong.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi also thanked her, exhausted</p>
<p class="orv_line">I did the same.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You saved my life, you really put up a good fight.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are your wounds okay?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. It&#x27;s nothing, thankfully.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, the ground rat&#x27;s teeth had only scratched my side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, if Jung Heewon hadn&#x27;t come, I would have died there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I completely miscalculated our power. I didn&#x27;t expect the readers party to be so crappy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I came here because I was worried. I saw two weak men and a small girl leaving as a scouting</p>
<p class="orv_line">party..... I was honestly nervous.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, Jung Heewon was the only one who objectively grasped our party&#x27;s strength.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the previous battle was surprising even when I thought about it again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was this strong.</p>

<p>faith in you.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">I can&#x27;t believe that &#x27;Cheon Inho&#x27; is trusted by Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Life really is hard to understand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But why did you move in such a hurry?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon&#x27;s question made Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi look at me at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because we have to rescue the survivors.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Survivors?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There&#x27;s someone I know near Oksu Station.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon nodded as if she understood.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I see. Your parents, your family?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If I had to say...... They&#x27;re like family.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi looked at me and nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If that&#x27;s the case, I&#x27;ll help you too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;d really appreciate it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it would be okay to go with Jung Heewon. She was going to be a main member of Kim</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dokja&#x27;s Company, so there was no harm if she accompanied us in advance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there was something I needed to do before I left again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at the bodies of the two fallen ground rats.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hmm? What are you going to do?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were two main reasons why our party was so unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One, the lack of main combat skills, and two.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s make weapons.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if something had come to their mind, Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi jumped out of their</p>
<p class="orv_line">seats.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It must have been the development of the main story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Kyung Sein&#x27;s expression brightened for a moment, and then quickly darkened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But...... Inho-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you know how to do it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was the problem.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ground rat&#x27;s spine sword! Ground rat&#x27;s spine sword!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein had been repeating the words like a mantra for several minutes now, holding the</p>
<p class="orv_line">head of a ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you doing?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m trying to do something.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I think she has watched too many cartoons.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I left Kyung Sein alone and took out the knife I had borrowed from the Cheoldoo Group earlier.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Then I used Incite on myself.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill &#x27;Incite Lv2&#x27; is activated!]</div>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv2' is activated!]</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「This isn&#x27;t gross at all. I&#x27;m a professional butcher.」</div>「This isn't gross at all. I'm a professional butcher.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grabbed the ground rat by the head and started tearing off its skin. Honestly, I was worried</p>
<p class="orv_line">because I&#x27;ve never done any butchering before, but it wasn&#x27;t as hard as I thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Upon closer inspection, I realized that the skin had a dotted line along the spine. Like a creature</p>
<p class="orv_line">made to be cut along the dotted line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought that this was enough for people who hadn&#x27;t read &#x27;Ways of Survival&#x27; like Kim Dokja,</p>
<p class="orv_line">then I turned to the side and saw Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi gagging.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Oh well, that&#x27;s normal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, on the other hand, stuck to my side and watched the whole grooming process with</p>
<p class="orv_line">interest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Where did you learn to do this?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Self-taught.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">My shoulders got tense for no reason.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I must be pretty talented, right? Jung Heewon added with a wry smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But since you&#x27;re self-taught, you&#x27;re not very good at it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#x27;t bully me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grunted for about twenty minutes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a snap, the first ground rat&#x27;s spine was cleanly separated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi was impressed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Now that&#x27;s a convincing one.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in their natural state, the vertebrae of ground rats resembled a sword. Indeed, a creature that</p>
<p class="orv_line">defied evolutionary odds to have a spine made by a single bone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is for Heewon-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Really? Can I take it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because you&#x27;re our team&#x27;s biggest power.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was a monster who could beat two ground rats with a pipe, and then I gave her a</p>
<p class="orv_line">ground rat knife?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s only a matter of catching the bus from now on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah...... Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon accepted the knife as if she was embarrassed, and then examined the front and</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">back of the knife for a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Suddenly I feel like I&#x27;m back in the Paleolithic age.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stopped and looked up. I thought it sounded familiar, but then I realized it was a line from</p>
<p class="orv_line">Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hesitated for a moment.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「May I answer?」</div>「May I answer?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I inhaled lightly, then spoke in a somewhat theatrical tone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You need to grind it a bit more for it to be useful. There are rocks around so skillfully grind the</p>
<p class="orv_line">blade.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh, understood, Captain.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Originally, this conversation had been between Kim Dokja and Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who came up behind them, scolded me with a whisper.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#x27;t you think you&#x27;re getting too close to Heewon-nim?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, someone has to look out for her. Until we meet Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I said that, my heart gradually grew heavy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if I could do as much as Kim Dokja did.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Would I be able to help Jung Heewon survive in this world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;By the way, there&#x27;s a problem. Heewon-nim won&#x27;t be able to grow as fast as things are going</p>
<p class="orv_line">now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if reading my mind, Kyung Sein whispered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You remember that? Heewon-nim, gets stronger for real after her awakening as the &#x27;Judge of</p>
<p class="orv_line">Destruction&#x27;. At this rate, even if we meet the real Kim Dokja, Heewon-nim may not be as active</p>
<p class="orv_line">as she was in the main novel.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon&#x27;s strongest skill is [Hour of Judgement].</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order to obtain it, she must become the &#x27;Judge of Destruction&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there are two prerequisites for her to do so.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One is that she is subjected to brutal violence by the Cheoldoo Group.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And two.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;In order for Heewon-nim to awaken as in the original, Cheon Inho-ssi must die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">My death.</p>
