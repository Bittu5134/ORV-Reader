<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The back of Jaehwan, who was walking a few steps ahead, was blurry.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Walking, stopping for a moment to rest, and walking again.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I repeated that simple task while carrying Yoo Jonghyuk who had fallen.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your incarnation body is unstable.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Warning. Enter a new 'scenario'.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't some kind of health alert, and I smiled bitterly as I heard the same message intermittently.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Who wouldn't enter the 'main scenario' without knowing?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I wonder if it was a mistake to intentionally fail the 'scenario'? 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">An old sentiment came flooding back, but I didn't really regret it.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">At that time, it was the best choice.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Failing the scenario and being stripped of the status of 'constellation'. And thus being banished outside the scenarios.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">That was the only way to save all the readers, including the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your incarnation body is unstable.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The cough that I spit out left a trail of stories.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your incarnation body is breaking apart.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A body that would not be strange if it collapsed at any moment. Nevertheless, my incarnation body still managed to maintain its shape.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive trait effect is activated.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The effect of the exclusive trait 'Record Repairer' delays the collapse of your incarnation body.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Exclusive trait 'Record Repairer'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">This trait, which was activated by collecting a certain amount of 'Kim Dokja Fragments', had a certain level of immunity effect only against the collapse of the incarnation body.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, this trait alone was not enough to withstand the collapse.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is activating.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The [Fourth Wall]. Kim Dokja's main skill, and the skill that saved him from danger every time, if this skill hadn't been activated in time, I would have passed out without being able to overcome the pain.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I imagined the 'Demon King of Salvation' and the little Kim Dokja beyond this wall.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">People who still liked this story even after going through that terrible scenario together.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Kim Dokja thought. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">They were talking.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 We have to survive. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">With a thud, the story flowed back once more.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">How many more times did I vomit stories like that?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jaehwan, who had been walking far away, stopped walking. It seemed like he was going to take a short break.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I laid Yoo Jonghyuk down on a stone floating around.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Is it the effect of the 'Summoning Squad' I had fed him earlier? Yoo Jonghyuk's incarnation was quickly recovering.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The deep wound below his kneecap was also slowly healing.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After all, the main character is the main character.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If this continues, Yoo Jonghyuk will be able to finish recovering and return to the scenario in a few days.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is that I don't know if I will be alive by then.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your incarnation body is unstable.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I felt drowsy once in a while, and every time I did, a terrible cold air came over me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I must not lose consciousness.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I desperately recalled Kim Dokja’s story.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Sometimes, Kim Dokja had experienced something similar to me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 If I don’t quickly save my incarnation body and seal my wounds, all my stories will collapse and I will die. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I imagined Kim Dokja walking alone on the horizon of the stories. Kim Dokja walking alone in the world without a star’s gaze or a scenario.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">He ate the story fragments on the horizon of the stories, and used them to repair his incarnation body and overcome the crisis.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">How did 'Kim Dokja' absorb the story fragments back then?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Lamarck’s giraffe. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">That’s right. Kim Dokja, the 'Demon King of Salvation', clearly had such a trait. If that’s the case, then I can also use that trait.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' looks at you with displeasure.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' grumbles and begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After a while, a light bulb turned on in my head, and the trait was activated.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can now temporarily use the exclusive attribute 'Lamarck's Giraffe'.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Lamarck's Giraffe.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">With this trait, Kim Dokja was able to temporarily restore his incarnation body by absorbing small 'story fragments'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is that I don't have any remaining 'story fragments' to use for restoration.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">That's when the sound of a vacuum cleaner could be heard from afar.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A flock of 'nameless things' swimming through space. Behind the guys who were scurrying around the void like a school of mackerel, a monster with a fierce appetite could be seen. An eerie presence that could be clearly felt from afar.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A deity from another world. The shark-headed alien with a human body was disturbing the group like a predator, biting the 'nameless ones'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I really hoped it wouldn't look this way, but this time, the &lt;Star Stream&gt; betrayed my expectations.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Ooooooooo】</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The alien's cries made my mind dizzy. The guy who quickly wiggled his fins rushed towards me with his fearsome teeth flashing.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A murderous feeling that made my spine tingle.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I instinctively grabbed the hilt of 'Unbreakable Faith' sword, a flash of light flashed before my eyes.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jaehwan swung his sword.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The shark alien that had opened its mouth wide disappeared with its head exploding.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was an unbelievable act of inaction. Even if it wasn't at the level of the 'Dream Eater', it seemed like an outer deity with its own name.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In any case, now was not the time to be completely surprised. This was because the fragments of the outer deity's legend floating in the void caught my eye.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive trait 'Lamarck's Giraffe' reacts.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Most of them were contaminated or damaged and unusable, but there were some that I could consume now.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I sneakily looked at Jaehwan's expression and asked.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Can I eat that?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jaehwan glanced at me indifferently and quickly turned his head away.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly approached the Shark's story fragment. I saw a story fragment that looked exactly like a shark's fin.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story fragment 'Rapid Swim' rejects your touch.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story in question is contaminated.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Eating the story in question may cause side effects.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Judging from the strong fishy smell, it seemed like it would be difficult to eat it as it was even if I utilized 'Lamarck's Giraffe'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After thinking for a moment, I searched through the arms of the unconscious Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Let's see, if my thoughts are right, he should have 'that item'. After a while, something like a small seasoning container was caught in my fingertips.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I checked the item information.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Item Information&gt;</p>
<p>Name: All-purpose special seasoning</p>
<p>Grade: A+</p>
<p>Description: Essence made from natural ingredients of the &lt;Star Stream&gt;. When sprayed, anything becomes edible. The recipe has not been revealed.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't have high expectations, but I didn't know this item really existed.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 All-purpose special seasoning. It's an item developed by Yoo Jonghyuk in the second round for emergency cooking. He himself doesn't use it often. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Why do people carry around things like this and not use them? I don't know.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I roughly sprinkled the special seasoning on the still fluttering fins, then took a deep breath and swallowed it.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The snow shard tasted like ramen soup sprinkled on the shark fin.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive trait 'Lamarck's Giraffe’s effect activates!]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story fragment 'Swimming Speed' refuses to .!]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The story fragment that entered my stomach began to shake. My stomach rumbled as if I had an emergency. However, I couldn't just spit it out.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your incarnation body is in danger.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If I spit this out now, I'll die. So I have to swallow it. I have to grit my teeth and get through it somehow.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">That's when someone hit my back with a thud. It hurt so much I screamed, so I turned around and saw Jaehwan there.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Why are you suddenly hitting someone? Are you a psychopath?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jaehwan looked at me for a moment without answering, then walked over and sat down nearby, sitting cross-legged.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did I realize why he had hit my back.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your digestive ability is enhanced.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive trait 'Lamarck's Giraffe' is strongly activated.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story fragment 'Rapid Swim' has been absorbed.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Could it be that he's helping me now? Not someone else, but 'Monarch Slayer' Jaehwan?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your incarnation body temporarily regains stability.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I felt my hunger disappearing quickly and my incarnation body recovering. I thought I could easily last another day or two at this rate.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I, thank you."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I bowed my head toward Jaehwan. Jaehwan pretended not to hear me and closed his eyes.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Is he repeating his mental stabbing toward the universe again?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">What on earth is he trying to stab with all that effort?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at Jaehwan for a moment and then muttered while examining Yoo Jonghyuk's details again.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"You say thank you too."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, Yoo Jonghyuk, who had passed out, didn't answer. It had been a while since I'd seen him sleeping so soundly. Even now, it seems like it was just yesterday that I was thrown under the bridge at Oksu Station, but I realized that a lot has happened since then.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">While going back and forth between the Washington Dome and the Recycling Center, Yoo Jonghyuk became a black beast, and also a little Yoo Jonghyuk wearing a red hat. He almost died several times, and in the end, this is what happened.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Damn bastard. Why did you chase me all the way here? This didn't happen even in the third round.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If he hadn't come to save me, Yoo Jonghyuk would have cleared the 'Recycling Center' without a hitch and started growing. His transcendence would have been higher, and he would have moved on to the next scenario without a hitch with the readers of Earth.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I ruined everything.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">So I have to save this guy.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After feeding Yoo Jonghyuk the 'summoning group' that I had divided up, I took a breather for a moment.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">While he was eating the remaining summoning group crumbs, my eyes met with Jaehwan's, who was looking at me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Why is he looking? I feel uneasy.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I recalled the information about him in my head.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The Monarch Slayer Jaehwan. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, since 『The World After The Fall』 was a work I was involved in, I remembered quite a bit of information about him.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">For example, if someone asked me, "Who is Jaehwan?", I could answer like this.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The protagonist who destroys the world by stabbing while naked. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">After summarizing, he seems like the type of person you should never get entangled with.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a moment and held out the summoning crumbs to Jaehwan.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Would you like some?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">When you first become close, isn't it best to share food?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Whether he was naked or destroyed the world by stabbing, it was something that happened in his universe.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">And in this &lt;Star Stream&gt;, he saved me twice.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Who knows? Maybe that 'Monarch Slayer' became a little kinder under the influence of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; worldview.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"You eat it."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a familiar comfort in his sharp answer and asked back.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What do you usually eat?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't eat anything in particular."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"If you don't eat anything, you die."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jaehwan didn't answer and just stared at me. Thanks to someone, I was already used to that kind of gaze.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I shook the seasoning bottle and smiled.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"If there's anything you want, I'll make it for you. There's some good seasoning here."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't really plan on cooking. I'm not Yoo Jonghyuk from the 81st round of 'Ways of Survival', so what kind of food would I cook in this 'change of scenario'? Even if I made it, it would be nothing more than 'Foreign Correspondent Sharkspin who died from a brutal stabbing'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">But I wanted to talk to that man who was hard to get close to, even like this. </p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">My life and Yoo Jonghyuk's life depended on that good-natured psychopath for the next week.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If he changed his mind and stabbed us to death right now, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' would end here.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"The kind of food I want to eat?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Huh?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"No one can make it now."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I was a little taken aback by his answer. I never imagined that the 'Monarch Slayer' would have a food he wanted to eat.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"What kind of food is it?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If possible, I was going to refer to 'Yoo Jonghyuk from the 81st round's recipe and make it. If I didn't have the ingredients, I could just raid Yoo Jonghyuk's coat pockets.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Jaehwan stared into space for a moment as if recalling a distant memory, then opened his mouth.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Dumplings."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at him for a moment, wondering if I had heard wrong.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">What did you say just now?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's a food called 'Murim Dumplings'."</p>
<br>
