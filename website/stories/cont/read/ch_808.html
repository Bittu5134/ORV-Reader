<p class="orv_line">I felt anxious. If the &#x27;comments&#x27; I just saw were true, something terrible would happen to Yoo Jonghyuk from now on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surprised by the disappearance of Yoo Jonghyuk, who was escorted with me, I hurriedly ordered someone to search the area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yoo Jonghyuk!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I called Yoo Jonghyuk&#x27;s name several times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk could die. No, maybe he&#x27;s already dead. If that happens-</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yoo Jonghyuk?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">And after a while, the guy&#x27;s head appeared between the crowd.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk, who appeared with one of his escorts, was glaring at me with his characteristically sullen eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, what if you suddenly disappear like that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There were some Murim dumplings nearby.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I looked closely, I saw a small dumpling in the guy&#x27;s mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, really, because of that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This restaurant&#x27;s Murim dumplings have inherited some of the original recipes. It&#x27;s my favorite restaurant.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the main story, Yoo Jonghyuk disappeared because of dumplings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason Yoo Jonghyuk eats Murim dumplings every time he visits Murim is probably because of his memories of Pacheon Sword Master.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Every time he swallows one of those dumplings, Yoo Jonghyuk must be constantly reminiscing about those days.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In short, that ritual is a necessary procedure for Yoo Jonghyuk to live while remembering the past rounds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Even if you look at it that way, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll give it to you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I won&#x27;t eat it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know. It seems like he just eats because he has to eat eight meals.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guards guarding him also seemed somewhat surprised at the sight of little Yoo Jonghyuk eating. It made sense since he was eating two dumplings in one bite.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yoo  Joonghyuk, it&#x27;s difficult if you disappear like that so suddenly.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was clear what they were thinking just from the looks the guards exchanged.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Is that guy really a disciple of Pacheon Sword Master?&quot;」</div>「Is that guy really a disciple of Pacheon Sword Master?"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a while, we arrived at Cheongryongseong Square. In the center of the square, a huge banner with the words &#x27;191st Terror Expedition&#x27; was fluttering.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The main scenario area is nearby.]</div>[The main scenario area is nearby.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Namgung Sega&#x27;s unmanned personnel pointed to the entrance of the venue and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The head of the family is waiting inside.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The inside of the venue was already crowded with people. Participants in the &#x27;Terror Expedition&#x27;. And the incarnations who came to see them off or watch them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The leader of this expedition is from Namgung Sega?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So the leader of the expedition is Namgung Myeong, the head of the small family?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s the rumor. How could that be? There&#x27;s no way that a promising star of Sega would participate in a scenario where they&#x27;re going to die...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tried to ignore the ominous words. In any case, entering the &#x27;main scenario&#x27; was the priority right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We stepped into the venue without hesitation. To be exact, that was what we were going to do.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are not allowed to enter the &#x27;event venue&#x27;.]</div>[You are not allowed to enter the 'event venue'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">What?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are an &#x27;exile&#x27;.]</div>[You are an 'exile'.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are not allowed to enter the venue without proof of identity.]</div>[You are not allowed to enter the venue without proof of identity.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a disconcerting message.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s not another scenario, but &#x27;proof of identity&#x27; is required for the &#x27;Terror Expedition&#x27;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did they find the spark flowing through my body? I saw the gatekeepers guarding the venue running towards me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, the guards of Namgung Se-ga came forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Step back. He is a distinguished guest of Namgung Sega. The guards were ordered by the Sega family to allow him to participate in the competition!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guards did not back down easily despite the threats of the guards.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Even if he is a guest of Namgung Sega, we cannot allow &#x27;exiles&#x27; in. That is the rules of the venue.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized once again how exiles are treated in the &#x27;scenario area&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Can Namgung guarantee that this person is not an extremely evil criminal?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Even if you are a criminal, you know that you can participate in the &#x27;Terror Expedition&#x27; if you have the permission of the Five Great Segae, right?”</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If the target is an &#x27;exile&#x27;, then it’s a little different. If an exile has flowed in here, then he is definitely not an ordinary being. What if he is a great villain who has incurred the wrath of the constellations?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The gatekeepers, who were glaring at me with sharp eyes, showed no sign of yielding.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Meanwhile, a shout was heard from inside the hall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The inaugural speech has begun!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this were to continue, I would miss all the scenario participation orders.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly nodded to Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Go in first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Then you,</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I’ll find a way to get in somehow. You should go in first and get a feel for the atmosphere inside the hall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk, who had been thinking for a moment, nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Don’t be late.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Following that, the Namgung Segae’s warriors bowed to me and disappeared into the hall with Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One of them said to me,</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will inform the lord of the situation. Please wait a moment.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded, but I felt strange inside.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Could it be that the Emperor Sword Namgung Jincheon had not anticipated this situation?</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the first place, the &#x27;Gongpyeongyeong Expedition&#x27; was an event that he and the Five Great Sega had planned together.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But he knew that I was an &#x27;Exiled One&#x27;, yet he couldn&#x27;t prevent my entry control in advance?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I had a bad feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What if the Emperor Sword&#x27;s purpose was to separate me and Yoo Jonghyuk?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are an &#x27;Exiled One&#x27;.]</div>[You are an 'Exiled One'.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You cannot enter the venue without proof of identity.]</div>[You cannot enter the venue without proof of identity.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shook my head vigorously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it was a trap, there was nothing I could do. Even the incarnation that the god had fixed wouldn&#x27;t last long. It would be a waste of time to wander around looking for another &#x27;main scenario&#x27; now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had to find a way to enter the venue.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is there no way for the Exiled One to enter?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The gatekeepers looked at each other as if they were troubled by my question, and answered in a somewhat sharp voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If there is a constellation that can vouch for you, an exile.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Constellation?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging from the expressions on the gatekeepers&#x27; faces, they seemed to think there would be no constellation that could vouch for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A constellation&#x27;s vouch.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked up at the pale sky and thought of constellations that could help me. There were modifiers that came to mind, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would see me, who had been kicked out of the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In addition, most of the constellations in that sky were hostile to me. If they knew I was here, there would be more of them who would come down to kill me, not to mention vouch for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, I couldn&#x27;t delay any longer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had to enter the stadium using [Incite] or some other trick.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, I made up my mind and was about to activate [Incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Those guys—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The entrance to the stadium was tumultuous. It was a crowd of unmanned people who had just started to enter. They seemed to be martial artists from the old village.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m looking forward to this expedition.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is &#x27;that&#x27; going to go too?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow, is it the old days? Well, this is a chance to restore the status of the fallen sect.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I watched the martial artists wearing splendid robes as they entered. Judging from their attire, they seemed to be masters of the Jeongpa.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s Shaolin!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There&#x27;s a shaman too!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shaolin, Hwasan, shaman... Masters of sects I&#x27;d only heard of through rumors were entering the competition hall one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But at the end of the line, there was a man in a familiar outfit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first, I couldn&#x27;t tell who he was. But when I looked at him once, twice, three times, I vaguely knew who he was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His face was different, but it was unmistakable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">More than anything, the story inside me was testifying to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, a middle-aged man who recognized me opened his eyes wide and opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You are...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this desolate First Murim, the one and only constellation that would guarantee my identity.</p>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have entered the new &#x27;Main Scenario&#x27; area.]</div>[You have entered the new 'Main Scenario' area.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The &#x27;Exile Penalty&#x27; is removed.]</div>[The 'Exile Penalty' is removed.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The new &#x27;Main Scenario&#x27; has arrived!]</div>[The new 'Main Scenario' has arrived!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The air of the &#x27;Scenario&#x27; has finally returned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was moved anew as I felt the refreshing breath of the story. This was the feeling of being alive—the feeling of clearly standing on my feet and living in the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to check the scenario content right away, but I had to express my gratitude first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thank you very much.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The middle-aged man who waved his hand with a friendly smile on his face. The story inside me reacted again.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;persistent martial arts master&#x27; shivers in joy.]</div>[The story 'persistent martial arts master' shivers in joy.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The middle-aged man who sensed the story nodded as if he was impressed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It seems it is listening to you now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You have been very helpful.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 「persistent martial arts master」 was once this middle-aged man&#x27;s story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is the first time we met since Seoul Station.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was the former head of Seoul Station, and the &#x27;last ark&#x27; of the Beggar Sect, the constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The dragon&#x27;s head ark &#x27;Cheon-gae&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;last ark&#x27; expresses its joy to you.]</div>[The constellation 'last ark' expresses its joy to you.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The events that happened at Seoul Station flashed through my mind like a panorama.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A constellation that wanted to step down from being a constellation and start the &#x27;scenarios&#x27; from the beginning again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That constellation, along with its incarnation, appeared before my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Your divine power has been revealed.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s thanks to you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He said that, but in fact, the feeling I got from Cheon-gae wasn&#x27;t as good as before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was natural.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that time, Cheon-gae was caught up in the aftermath of the probability related to the &#x27;god of the other world&#x27; and paid a huge price.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It seems you&#x27;ve been through a lot without me knowing.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I answered with a bitter smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps Cheon-gae and I were in a position to understand each other better than anyone else right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a sense, we were both &#x27;fallen constellations&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Didn&#x27;t the Ark come to participate in this scenario?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I said so, to keep the agreement of the Beggar Sect. I came back to where I have an agreement to keep.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon-gae, who was once one of the best in the &#x27;First Murim&#x27;, was pushed out of Murim after losing to &#x27;Paradox Baek-cheong&#x27; and &#x27;Pacheon Sword Saint&#x27; in succession.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I have decided to rewrite the history of my heaven from here. In the world where I fell and escaped.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You have made a big decision.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A decision that only a constellation who has acknowledged his own failure can make. Nevertheless, his expression was brighter than ever.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I thought that in order to understand my opponents, I needed to know the trials they overcame.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So you participated in the &#x27;Gong-ho-ryeong Expedition&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">After hearing the explanation, I understood why he had no choice but to participate in this expedition.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Gong-ho-ryeong is the cradle and grave of the Transcendents.」</div>「Gong-ho-ryeong is the cradle and grave of the Transcendents.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">That &#x27;Gong-ho-ryeong&#x27; was the only entrance to the &#x27;Dark Dimension&#x27; in this Murim. And the transcendentalists known in Murim were mostly from that &#x27;dark dimension&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The same goes for the paradoxical Baekcheong Kyrgios Rodgraim and the Pacheon Sword Master Namgung Minyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s right. By the way, since you came all the way here, I guess your circumstances are also difficult.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He seemed to have guessed why I had participated in the &#x27;Fortress Expedition&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There are many constellations that support you, including me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s something to be thankful for.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Of course, there are more constellations that want to kill you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I replied with a bitter smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ve heard the general rumor. That you defeated all the zodiac signs at the &#x27;Recycling Center&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It seems a bit exaggerated.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I also heard that you summoned otherworldly deities with just your three-inch tongue and had a big fight with the constellations.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Those &#x27;otherworldly deities&#x27; were probably from &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But they weren&#x27;t called by me; they just came looking for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I also heard that you poked holes in the stomachs of the constellations that were obsessed with you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">And it wasn&#x27;t me who did it, it was the stabbing monster, Jaehwan...</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You made a resolution with the naked man who shouted destruction…..&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s right, we went together…</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;When I heard that you summoned the archangels and demon kings and tried to recreate the &#x27;Holy Demon War&#x27; and destroy the &lt;Star Stream&gt;… I was really shocked.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some strange rumor is spreading.</p>
