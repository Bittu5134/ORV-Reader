        <article class="orv_main">
            <div class="orv_title"><h1>603 Episode 10. Writer (4)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">The person who uploaded illegal files pretended to be a writer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know what the hell the world is like.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake', encourages you anyway.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The reason why he was able to avoid [Lie Detection] was probably because he directly typed “Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Can he say he “wrote” that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought the decision of [Lie Detection] was absurd, but I suddenly felt funny.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Then what about me? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Touching the lemon candy in my pocket, I thought about the real author of this story.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 How much can I say I wrote this story? 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[‘Cinema Journey’, will begin soon.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Looking back, Jung Heewon, who had finished preparing, asked me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Are we going alone?”</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">I briefly looked at the other teams. Most of them had filled the three-person limit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Until the very end, the [Electrical sound] filled with regret lingered in my ears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Are you really not going to join us?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Sorry. Looking forward to the next time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a woman with a steel helmet and an old man with a pipe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Both teams had excellent power, but if they teamed up, problems could arise in the future scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Above all,</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Let’s see if we live.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">I can't take care of Sein and Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Take care of yourself too, ahjussi.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">The two formed a team of three with Lee Jihye.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“If you can't follow me, I'll throw you away.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Hey, I’ll work hard to follow you!”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye was gruff on the outside, but had a lot of affection in her heart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just like in the “Emergency Defense Battle,” Lee Jihye would not ignore the crisis between the two.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, the skills of Sein and Dansu ahjussi are not weak anymore.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is probably only one old man with a sacred relic of a constellation here.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Hmm, it looks like everyone is ready.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The dokkaebi Paul reappeared with the sound of tsutsutsutsu.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[But I see some people who haven't found their own team yet…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Paul added, taking a light scan of the lobby.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[If you don't have a team, you don't have to worry too much because it's a random match.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Random matching?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Starts to enter.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have been appointed as the team's representative.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Jung Heewon has joined your team.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Jung Jaewoo has joined your team.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt embarrassed. I deliberately didn't accept team members, but I never thought it would be a forced match like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Me, over there. hello.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">A man with a familiar face somewhere awkwardly lowered his head and approached.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps he is Jung Jaewoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“It seems like we’re on the same team… I’ll take good care of you.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Upon closer inspection, it was the reader who shouted to people earlier, "Who read it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt sorry for him as if he was shouting out the same words alone, like Kim Dokja, who was always recommending “TWSA.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, you can't believe it just by looking at it.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[‘List of Reader Comments’, is activated!]</p></div>

<p class="orv_line">First of all, there is nothing special about the profile, so I went straight into checking the comments.</p>
<div class="orv_window">

<p>—(Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, Chapter 102)</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">I was at a loss for words for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Jaewoo-ssi, right? I look forward to it.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Please take good care of me too.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who was watching from the side, also gave a short greeting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo may have recognized Jung Heewon, and he lowered his head with a face of regret.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Me too! It's an honor!”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Rather than teaming up with a stupidly dangerous person, a naive person like this might be better.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, a small dice appeared in front of my eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Roll the dice.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I held the dice lightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The readers around me who threw the dice first spit out swear words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Ah, damn it.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Is it 1 from the beginning?“</p>
<p class="orv_line">A dark color hovered over the 10 dice that came out. As you can see, the color of the dice changed depending on the number on the dice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at the dice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the scenario had progressed further, I could get help by obtaining the [God of Dice], a narrative-grade story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“I’ll throw it at once.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">After briefly exchanging glances with the party, I threw the dice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Oh?”</p>
<p class="orv_line">The dice glowed golden.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The number on the dice is 6.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon widened her eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Are you lucky?”</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Go up the stairs 6 steps.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Double Chance! You may roll the dice one more time.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I threw the dice again.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The number on the dice is 5.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Go up the stairs 5 steps.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have reached the second floor!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Is 10 steps equal to one floor?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't expect to come to the second floor at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even the luck didn't end there.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Enter the bonus stage!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Each person gets a coin bonus of 1,000!!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[An additional dice chance has been obtained!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The dice appeared again. I rolled the third dice.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The number on the dice is 5.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Go up the stairs 5 steps.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Enter the normal stage!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There are no assignments for this stage.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[After 3 minutes, an extra dice chance will be given.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Does this make sense?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was an incomprehensible level of luck. As soon as I started, I could roll the dice four times in a row.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked in surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Are you suddenly possessed? Are you good at this kind of game?”</p>
<p class="orv_line">In terms of luck, I was generally unlucky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had never won a common comment event or cash event once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Hmm… I think.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are no incidental stories in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, if strange luck suddenly came to me in a row, there must be a probable reason for that luck.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So for example…</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Jaewoo-ssi.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Do you have any passive skills?”</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Ah.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo slightly rolled his eyes and scratched his cheek awkwardly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“That… can I tell you…”</p>
<p class="orv_line">“If that’s a problem, you don't have to say anything.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was he more cautious than I thought?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Seeing that he practiced Kim Dokja’s maxim well, he may have read the entire novel pretty seriously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Oh, no. I'll tell you. It's not a skill… I have a trait called [Little Luck].”</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was surprised the moment I heard the characteristic name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">[Little Luck]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Needless to say, it was literally a trait that maximized trivial luck.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Should I give even the smallest luck to Kim Dokja? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a feature I was worried about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a time when I thought what it would be like to let Kim Dokja grow while evolving his characteristics from [Little Luck] to [Compliant Luck] and [Extreme Luck].</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 “Author-nim, there are so many main characters who solve it with luck these days…" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was discarded with one word of Ji Eunyu…</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I never thought there would be a reader with that characteristic.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“I don’t know why, but I was originally a little bit lucky.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo smiled brightly and began to tell stories I hadn't asked about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“When I go to buy bread, there is always one bread left that I want. Or, when I encounter a question I don't know the answer to, if I take it, I get it right… It's not that great, but small luck keeps following me.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a shy face, Jung Jaewoo continued to speak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“So, even after coming here, I was lucky enough to survive several times. I also found a bug on the subway…”</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story of how he evacuated to the ground to avoid a riot at Cheonggu Station, and the brother and sister he met there gave him Elaine Monkey's Lungs (probably the Killer King siblings).</p>
<p class="orv_line">“I asked them to come with me, but they refused.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">He went to the basement of Yaksu Station with his lungs bitten and encountered alien species, and luckily escaped with someone's help (it seems that he met the Misreading Association).</p>
<p class="orv_line">“I almost died then.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">After running away to the ground again, this time he met a rhinoceros in Sidog, and the story that someone killed the rhinoceros and left (Is it Yoo Joonghyuk?).</p>
<p class="orv_line">“The 4 knives were so fast that I couldn't see any of them."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, after running away so hurriedly, it was even said that when he came to his senses, he was at the Chungmuro ​​Theater before he knew it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“There are a lot of readers here, so I feel relieved.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">I blankly looked at Jung Jaewoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There really are people like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A really lucky man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Hey, but can we just talk about this?”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo, who belatedly covered his mouth, looked at Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, instead of listening to Jung Jaewoo, Jung Heewon was scouting the empty second-floor lobby.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo, slightly relieved, asked again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“That person… Is she the Jung Heewon I know? Right?”</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You're right.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Omg!”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who was far away, looked around this way because he was screaming so loudly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“What's going on?”</p>
<p class="orv_line">“It's nothing.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo could not calm down easily and gasped for breath. He asked:</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Have you met the other &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; members by any chance? I saw Lee Jihye as well. Did you see Kim Dokja and Yoo Joonghyuk—”</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Hey, Heewon might be confused, so let’s not talk about this now.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Oh, sorry.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo lowered his head with a sullen face and I felt sorry.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new dice has been created!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I handed him the dice to change the subject.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Will Jaewoo-ssi throw it this time?”</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Um, is that okay?”</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo nodded with a smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“More, I’ll throw it!”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo shouted vigorously and rolled the dice.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The number on the dice is 5.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Go up the stairs to the third floor.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I was expecting a 6, but a 5 wasn't too bad.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With this, the total number of dice rolls is 21.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Are we going to the third floor at once?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I might be lucky to have met Jung Jaewoo here.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Fell into the 'trap stage'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Go down the stairs by 3 steps.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Huh?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Enter the normal stage.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Didn't [Little Luck] work this time?</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Get ready.”</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can clear this stage by watching the movie's ending.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The difficulty of this stage is high. Upon clearing the stage, a ‘ladder’ is provided.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This stage is shared with the first runners.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the blink of an eye, a landscape of greenery unfolded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought I knew where this place was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking around, Jung Heewon and Jung Jaewoo seemed to have noticed the general situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The cries of giant monsters could be heard from everywhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Somehow, it seemed to be the movie that Kim Dokja and his party cleared in “ORV.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo murmured.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Oh my god. Hey, is this the movie? Tyranno comes out—”</p>
<p class="orv_line">“It seems so.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it was really that movie, the difficulty level was high, but I could get quite useful items.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, the enhanced ampoule hidden in the central laboratory.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was just one thing that stuck.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Share the stage with the starters.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Obviously, the system messages were taken that way. In other words, it meant that there was a “starter” who entered this stage before us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who is it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it Yoo Joonghyuk?</p>
