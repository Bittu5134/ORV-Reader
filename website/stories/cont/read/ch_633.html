<p class="orv_line">Anyway, since I came this far, I had to meet the ark of the Beggar Sect.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Our goal is to find a cure for Jung Eunho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this place is really the Beggar Sect of Murim, no matter how degraded it may be, there will be some useful spirits.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's go together."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm going alone now. Please take care of Eunho in the meantime."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If anything happens, call me right away, you know?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it was normal, of course I would have moved with Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But this time it was difficult.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because now I'm someone’s disciple, and Kyrgios's disciple isn't frightened by the Beggar Sect.</p>
<div class="orv_notice"><p>Let’s change the strange name from before to Kyrgios. Lee Hahkyun is now pretending to be Kyrgios’s disciple.In other words, there is no need for an escort.</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll take this guy with me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said, pointing at the spotted boy, our hostage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy seemed to have resigned himself, but now he was in a compliant state.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Go all the way over there."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the end of the opening, I started walking along the path to the waiting room.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that the spotted boy on my back opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Mister."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uh."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's useless even if you take me. A person like me is worthless as a hostage."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I paused, then put the spotted boy on the floor and untied the knots from his hands and feet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The puzzled boy looked up at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you freeing me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I replied with a grin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You said you weren't worth being a hostage."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I. Can I run away?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you want to?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The spotted boy bowed his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, this boy knows it too. There is no place in this world for children to run away to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Scenarios are hell everywhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only thing this boy who didn't have great abilities could do was to dig a trap using his fucked up appearance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Your father, I heard that person suddenly changed."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The startled boy raised his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How has it changed? Please explain."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Just. All of a sudden, he was a completely different person."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"His appearance has changed?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"His appearance is the same. The behavior of the homeless is the same."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy hesitated and continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"My dad was homeless, but he wasn't a bad guy. He ruined his business and went bankrupt and lost all of his money, but he wasn't one to hurt anyone."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The closer he got to the waiting room, the more the spotted boy stuttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It all changed by touching that strange stone…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Strange stone?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Soon after, the waiting room at Seoul Station, covered with a huge cloth, appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It looked as if a relief camp had been set up in the center of Seoul Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Therein lies the Ark of the Beggar Sect.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I went inside and into the tent with the shivering spotted boy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the center of the tent, there was a huge stone on the floor, and just below the stone were the tables and chairs of the broken waiting room.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ark of the Beggar Sect was sitting in one of the chairs drinking tea.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if someone is enjoying this cataclysmic time leisurely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even knowing that I had appeared in the tent, he continued to sip his tea without being conscious of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There's something strange about the tea here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then the four beggars who were guarding him bowed their heads.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The tea I used to know doesn't taste like this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm sorry. That was all I could get here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It can't be helped."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Ark sniffed once again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Just as the Murim we remembered has disappeared, the scent of the tea that people talk about has changed."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like I was suddenly in the middle of a martial arts novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Obviously, the place and time are different. This place was far from Murim.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, the moment he opened his mouth, this place became Murim.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter where he is, he is a being who can change the scenery around him with just his words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't stand there, come over and sit down. Welcome to the Beggar Sect."</p>
<p class="orv_line">This place is truly the 'Beggar Sect'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt that way all over again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Excuse me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sat on the opposite side of the ark with a nonchalant look.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I sat down, Ark asked, sipping a sip of tea.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why did you bring that child?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The spotted boy who caught his gaze shook his shoulders.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said as I lightly wrapped my arms around the child's shoulders.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah. A hostage."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hostage?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, no matter how you look at it, it wasn't the way he looked at his own child.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I added a word.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You have a brave son."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did the Ark's eyes change.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Ark looked at the spotted boy carefully and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"All the children of the Beggar Sect are brave. Even with their grandparents and begging for food on the street, they take care of themselves."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't know what you expected, but I don't think I'm going to give you any special treatment just because you're my son. From the moment you enter this group, the distinction between a child and an adult is meaningless. We're just beggars living under the same sky as a roof."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said while holding the spotted boy's shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Beggars are children, and adults are adults."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"From the point of view of the universe, the two are not very different."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a plausible statement to hear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that was not something that could be said from a human's point of view.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"From a star’s point of view, that might be the case."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The spotted boy said that his father suddenly became 'another person'.</p>

<p>&lt;Character information&gt;</p>
<p>Name: Myung Sewoon</p>
<p>Age: 44</p>
<p>Sponsor: The Last Ruler</p>
<p>Exclusive Attributes: Homeless (Normal), Murim (Rare)</p>
<p>Exclusive Skills: [Camping Lv.3], [Fishing Lv.3], [Verse Lv.3]...</p>
<p>Stigma: [Punching stick Lv.3]...</p>
<p>Overall stats: [Stamina Lv.25], [Strength Lv.25], [Agility Lv.25], [Magic Power Lv.25]</p>
<p>Comprehensive Evaluation: This person acts as a proxy for the will of the last ruler.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">An incarnation with decent overall abilities.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, what really bothered me was the comprehensive evaluation, not the comprehensive ability.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 A proxy of the constellation's will is. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Is it some kind of possession? But can it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">There's no way a constellation-class existence could possess an incarnation from the beginning of the scenarios.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tested my luck.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why is a constellation here? The last ruler. This place is not Murim."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Constellation 'The Last Ruler'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the record of 'Ways of Survival' is correct, the Beggar Sect was kicked out of Murim after being defeated by Kyrgios and the Pajeon Swordsman in &lt;The 2nd Murim&gt; and &lt;The 3rd Murim&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, the 'last ruler' refers to the last 'Ark' of the Beggar Sect.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no mistake.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, what is controlling the incarnation in front of me right now is.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The leader of the Beggar Sect that became a constellation. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Ark completely opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You are an interesting young man. Did you find out that far already?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the Ark put the teacup down, the air around him changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew it instinctively.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The pressure I felt from the Ark right now was at least a '6th-grade monster'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, I am the dragon head ark of the Beggar Sect."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it an illusion? With that declaration, it really seemed like the signboard of the Beggar Sect could be seen behind him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps that is his story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Murim's prestigious political faction, which has been around for over a thousand years, is the Beggar Sect.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw a flag flying behind his back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A purple flag.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The flag of 'Capture the Flag' starts with white, passes through red, indigo, brown, and purple, and finally ends in black.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the ark in front of my eyes obtained a purple flag not long after the scenario began.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know, but all the representatives of the Seoul Station area must have died at the hands of the Beggar Sect.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's such a horrifying growth that even Yoo Joonghyuk would be wary.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was genuinely curious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he appeared in 'Ways of Survival', then by whom did he change his name?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I spoke calmly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't understand. Why did you rush into the incarnation's pastime with the stature of a great star?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, from the existence of the possessed body of the constellation in this initial scenario, the probability of the scenario should not allow this to happen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's a great star. You seem to know a lot about constellations."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Ark laughed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you also a being who knows the future?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to faint for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, Sergeant Jung Munho was caught and said that he blew on this and that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That friend told me an interesting story. This world is actually in a story, and we are all characters in that story."</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, what are you talking about, dear reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I thought it was an interesting analogy. I've often had similar thoughts."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, the famous ark of the Beggar Sect seemed to accept reality as it is as a metaphor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If this is really a story, what kind of story will remain of my 'Beggar Sect'? Is the history of the 'Beggar Sect' over now? Is it remembered as a den of mere beggars that is no longer talked about by people?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a voice of deep remorse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A faint scent wafted from the half-remaining dragon's teacup. It had such a faded scent that it was hard to tell what kind of tea leaves it was made from.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I just took a chance. A chance to start over again. A chance to stir up the narrative once again and the Beggar Sect to be remembered in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Got a chance. By whom?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who can provide the probability that the existence of a constellation class can interfere at the beginning of the scenarios?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All I know is that I have to stop this crazy beggar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then you came to the wrong place."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I also gave up a lot in return. Can you feel the status of a constellation from me now?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it was strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Ark was obviously strong, but he wasn't comparable to a constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he really had the status of a constellation, the moment I met him, I would have burst out of my limbs, unable to withstand the pressure of the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's get to the main topic. Hey, I heard you're a disciple of Kyrgios."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Ark's eyes sank coldly. I knew it instinctively. This confrontation is real from now on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Can you prove it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, I am not his disciple, so there are no mortuary tablets or holy relics to prove it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.5' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, I know a real disciple of Kyrgios.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I am Kim Dokja. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I thought that sentence, I felt like I had truly become a disciple of Kyrgios.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was not afraid of anything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The smallest is the greatest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And I want to hit Yoo Joonghyuk in the back of the head. Perhaps they felt the atmosphere, and the complexion of the beggars lined up behind the Ark changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The last point was [White and Blue Steel], which LiteratureGirl64 passed on to me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'White and Blue Steel Lv.1' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Sensing bluish magic flowing from my body, Ark opened his eyes wide.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He said, "You really were Kyrgios’s disciple."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The beggars who were guarding him from behind were also greatly agitated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Really, his apprentice came here... do you know what that means?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A subtle sense of intimidation spread subtly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grinned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know. And I know that my acquaintances have been strengthened through your actions."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"So?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to be able to say this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But my mouth is already out of my control.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because I was that Kim Dokja now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Give me the Summoning Team Sirog."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is amazed at your spirit.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja, the living voice of Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Summoning team? Why did you come to the Beggar Sect to find Shaolin's Elixir?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If there is no summoning group, the suicide squad or whatever is fine. In any case, give me an elixir that can heal internal wounds."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ark opened his mouth as if he was dumbfounded by my words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is that all?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, I have one more business."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I also wanted to cover my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What was in front of my eyes was a crazy constellation turned into a beggar, and my head could burst if I kept talking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, I was very firm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Give me that flag, too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because I was a crazy Kim Dokja now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Otherwise, next time our master will find this place himself."</p>
