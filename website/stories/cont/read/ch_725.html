            <div class="orv_title"><h1>725 Episode 28 House (3)</h1>725 Episode 28 House (3)</div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked closely at the faces and actions of my companions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were a total of four people without masks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, Dansu ahjussi, Ye Hyunwoo, and Cha Yerin. It&#x27;s hard to express, but apart from their appearance, it felt like something had changed. It feels like the &#x27;story&#x27; that makes up their essence, so to speak, has changed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[An incarnation that loses its &#x27;mask&#x27; will become a beast.]</div>[An incarnation that loses its 'mask' will become a beast.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">In simple terms, it would mean that they have become &#x27;animals&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But for some reason, the moment I heard that, the expression &#x27;beast&#x27; had a slightly different meaning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—These guys are now prisoners of the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Prisoners.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Let’s go out together for a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King spoke in a serious tone. I once again realize that this person is someone who can speak normally.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I followed Killer King outside under the pretext of wanting to get some fresh air. Little Yoo Jonghyuk was also there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Outside the wooden villa, rain was falling steadily. The sound of a building collapsing was heard from afar.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The &#x27;event scenario&#x27; is currently in progress.]</div>[The 'event scenario' is currently in progress.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The screams of incarnations were heard one after another. A horribly spreading sibilant sound. The sound of hard flesh being torn apart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King seemed familiar with all of this and calmly took out a cigarette from his chest and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Has this person always smoked?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We were honestly confident when we first came up, because it was us and not the other incarnations.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King&#x27;s confidence was not strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">These people were all &#x27;complete readers&#x27;, that is, readers who survived  by going through as many as seven scenarios. Even if an unfamiliar scenario appeared, they now had the power to go through it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some had a good sponsor, and those who did not have a good sponsor had their own specialties.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The positions were perfect as well. Kyung Sein is Lee Hyunsung. Lee Dansu is Lee Gilyoung. Cha Yerin is Lee Jihye. For me, Yoo Jonghyuk.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though the last one was a little strange, it was a group composition that would definitely not be overlooked anywhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that&#x27;s what happened to them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It might have been a little different if you had been around, but it would be meaningless now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What on earth happened?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s an obvious story. We let our guards down and got caught in an unfortunate event scenario.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The hazy smoke melted into the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We had no idea what losing one’s mask meant. The first to suffer was Kyung Sein. Next was Lee Dansu. Ye Hyunwoo. And even my younger sister.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King&#x27;s voice became heavier with each word.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They were no longer able to live as humans.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What does that mean?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’ll show you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King took the lead and started walking down the alley as if telling me to follow him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sight of him walking ahead was unfamiliar. In just one month and a week, Killer King seemed to have become someone else I didn&#x27;t know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that the event scenario contents arrived.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Sub-scenario — The Three Little Pigs&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Sub</p>
<p>Difficulty: B</p>
<p>Clear conditions: Find a &#x27;safe house&#x27; to avoid wolves and avoid &#x27;hunting&#x27;.</p>
<p>Time limit: 8 hours</p>
<p>Reward: 500 Recycled Coins</p>
<p>Failure: Loss of &#x27;mask&#x27; and progress to dehumanization.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, this scenario is about finding a safe home where you can avoid the &#x27;wolves&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The area you are located in is Zone 13, District 64.]</div>[The area you are located in is Zone 13, District 64.]</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[If a victim occurs in the area, the event scenario in that area ends.]</div>[If a victim occurs in the area, the event scenario in that area ends.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to the explanation, this area is never safe until the &#x27;hunt&#x27; is completed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Killer King spoke in a carefree voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don’t worry. The wolf has already chosen its prey.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The place where Killer King arrived was an old house located one block away from the guesthouse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be exact, it was an old tent that was embarrassing to call a house.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King rang the bell installed in front of the tent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King responded to the voice coming from inside.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s the wolf.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at Killer King in surprise. Next, I heard a system message in my ear.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A &#x27;wolf&#x27; has appeared in that district.]</div>[A 'wolf' has appeared in that district.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">A frightened gasp was heard from inside the house. The one that stuck its head out was a pale prairie dog.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, are you here?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Preparations are complete.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Good night.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Inside the tent were several small animals, including prairie dogs. And there was a hippopotamus chained to a chair.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The prairie dog said, pointing to the hippopotamus.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is the &#x27;prey&#x27; volunteer for this time.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The hippopotamus cried, shaking his shoulders. Killer King slowly approached the hippopotamus.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let’s get started.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">What do you want to start with?</p>
<p class="orv_line">A ferocious energy flowed from Killer King&#x27;s right hand as he took off his half-mask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Feeling ominous, I grabbed Killer King&#x27;s shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King&#x27;s eyes flickered as he looked back at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, someone grabbed my hand. It was little Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Leave it alone.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk was speaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s none of your business.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, the prisoners in the tent didn&#x27;t look like they were happy with my dissuasion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t know who you are…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as the prairie dog opened his mouth, the meerkat beast next to him helped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Please don’t get involved.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Please.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I looked at the trembling beastmen, I let go of Killer King&#x27;s shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then Killer King spoke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don’t worry. I’ll finish it soon.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, Killer King stood in front of the hippopotamus. The moment the hippopotamus closed his eyes, Killer King let out a long cry into the air. It was a long, lonely howl reminiscent of a real wolf.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The wolf checks the &#x27;prey&#x27;.]</div>[The wolf checks the 'prey'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, Killer King grabbed one of the hippopotamus&#x27;s arms. With a clunking sound, the hippopotamus&#x27;s arm was torn off in an instant, and blood splattered out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Other prisoners grabbed the hippopotamus struggling in pain and quickly began providing first aid.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King put the torn hippopotamus&#x27;s arm to his side, took out a jingling sack from his chest, and handed it to the prairie dog.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The prairie dog that checked the inside of the bag became happy and muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thank you. Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is another week…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The bag was full of recycled coins.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King looked at the prisoners gathered around the coin bag for a moment, then turned his back and walked out of the tent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk and I hurriedly followed him.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Hunt&#x27; occurred in Zone 13, District 64.]</div>['Hunt' occurred in Zone 13, District 64.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The &#x27;sacrifice&#x27; conditions for the district are met.]</div>[The 'sacrifice' conditions for the district are met.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">A message that comes one step late.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did I understand what Killing King had done.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is the core of this scenario. If the wolf hunts the prey, the event conditions are met, and the remaining beasts can survive.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is it possible that you have survived this way?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason why the group was able to survive so far in the old wooden villa.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s because Killer King has been working as a &#x27;wolf&#x27; and hunting other preys.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The other party members chose the pig camp. They planned to form a community with the beastmen and fight against the wolves.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you think about it, it was natural.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The group read Kim Dokja&#x27;s story, and above all, he took the side of the &#x27;little people&#x27; in Peace Land. So, it was natural to take the pig&#x27;s side in &#x27;The Three Little Pigs&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Above all, &#x27;The Three Little Pigs&#x27; is a story where the pig wins in the end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They failed.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That’s right. And their mask was taken away.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I chose the wolf.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But there was only one choice.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, all I got was the message &#x27;you can choose the pig side&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The wolf camp has hidden options. It is designed so that you can only join the wolf camp by harming other &#x27;beasts&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, Killer King chose the &#x27;wolf camp&#x27; despite harming other prisoners.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why did you do that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because this scenario is a game the pigs can’t win.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had no idea that Killer King, let alone anyone else, would say such a thing. I was puzzled and disappointed at the same time. Is it because I believed in Killer King that much?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You don’t know what Zone 13 is.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I asked you why you did that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King&#x27;s eyes, seen through the mask, were slightly widened. He said as if it had been a long time since he had heard anything like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, you can say that. You are indeed Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There is a strategy for every scenario. You know that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if you choose the pig camp, there are many ways to attack as long as you use the original story well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were even many smart people among the group. Neither Ye Hyunwoo nor Cha Yerin were people to be taken lightly. But why—</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know what you’re thinking. I also know the origin story of this scenario.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then why—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I guess you checked the other houses on the way here. Did you notice anything strange?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The street I walked with little Yoo Jonghyuk. The inn we entered when we first warped, the wooden villa where the group lived, and the old tent house. and…</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No way.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goosebumps slowly appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A cigarette fell on the floor. Killer King took out a second cigarette, lit it, and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There are no brick houses here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The original content of 『The Three Little Pigs』 is clear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is a story about the youngest pig who built a sturdy &#x27;brick house&#x27; in preparation for the wolf and ultimately manages to prevent the wolf from attacking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t know why, but no matter what I do, I can’t find bricks in this area.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, in Zone 13, there are no &#x27;bricks&#x27; to build a &#x27;brick house&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, it was a place where it was impossible to reproduce the original story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So you chose &#x27;Wolf&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Zone 13 is divided into a total of 64 districts. Once hunting activities are met in one district, no more &#x27;event scenarios&#x27; will occur in the same district that night.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">By &#x27;hunting&#x27; different preys, you meet the scenario clear conditions in this area each time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King has been protecting his companions like that for as long as a month.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is the solution I chose.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King, who was staring at the distant sky, looked at me once, then looked at little Yoo Jonghyuk and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If it were Yoo Jonghyuk, it’s a choice he would never have made.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Explosive sounds were heard again amidst the rain. The sound of a tent collapsing and flesh being torn apart. The sound of ominous footsteps was getting closer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wolf Harvest House. I’m coming to collect today’s rewards.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King said, shaking the hippopotamus arm in his hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It doesn’t matter since the hunting in this area is over, but just in case, take him and hide.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hid behind the tent with little Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a while, harvesters wearing wolf masks appeared one by one. At a glance, they were incarnations with unusual physical strength.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could tell just by feeling their stories. They were all incarnations that had ruled this area for a very long time and survived.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Newbie. What’s the harvest today?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It is here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King snapped and threw out the hippopotamus paw.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After checking the front paw, the wolf harvester took a piece of flesh and chewed it lightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s a stinky part. Doesn’t this guy even have a proper story?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you got it, get out of here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The wolf harvester spat on the floor and laughed bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;re still rude. Are you overconfident in your abilities?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you want to check, I’ll show you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The wolf harvesters flinched and backed away at the growling voice of Killer King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One of the harvest officers said with a hardened expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ever since you took over this Earth, harvests have dropped significantly.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I heard a rumor that you were secretly raising skins.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s a rumor.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’ll know if it’s a rumor or not when I check.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, the Wolf Harvester looked towards the wooden villa. Only then did Killer King realize the true intentions of the harvesters and frowned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The beastmen of this Earth belong to me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The newly arrived leather belongs to the central district. You cannot take it as you wish until it is assigned.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is my Earth. I decide that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I guess he has already collected a lot of stories, so the stories flowing from Killer King&#x27;s body were unusual. At that level, he is on par with the other top-tier incarnations I met at the Washington Dome.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, a strange thought occurred to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though Killer King had reached such a level, why did he have to choose the &#x27;wolf camp&#x27;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you think about it, the answer was simple.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An entity he cannot dare to confront belongs to the &#x27;wolf camp&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From behind the wolf harvest stands, an individual that was two heads taller than the other wolves slowly walked out.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[That&#x27;s funny, young wolf.]</div>[That's funny, young wolf.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard the mantra, the fluff on my forearms stood out.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have no decision-making power.]</div>[You have no decision-making power.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to the explanation in &#x27;Ways of Survival&#x27;, the &#x27;Recycling Center&#x27; was clearly a place where incarnations gathered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But why does someone like that exist here?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;The Wolf Who Covets Little Red Riding Hood&#x27; smiles evilly.]</div>[The constellation 'The Wolf Who Covets Little Red Riding Hood' smiles evilly.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a &#x27;constellation&#x27; in Zone 13.</p>
