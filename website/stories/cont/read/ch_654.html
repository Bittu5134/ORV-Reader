<p class="orv_line">With Shin Yoosoung, I held my breath and hid between the underground passages.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, a group of people jumped out from the opposite street corner.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This way!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did they notice us?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the movement, there is a feeling that they are intentionally directed this way, but the target is us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I used &#x27;group chat&#x27; with Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Shin Yoosoung. You should run away immediately.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt that no matter what happened, I had to save this child.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Shin Yoosoung dies here, the 41st round will end with the worst ending I can think of.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—If ahjussi runs away too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A formidable answer came back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hesitated to answer, but Shin Yoosoung sent another message.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—But maybe we can win?</p>
<p class="orv_line">ㅡIt could be.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it&#x27;s because of &#x27;Beast Lord? Shin Yoo-seung seemed to be able to know the talents of incarnations just by looking at them.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story, &#x27;the tenacious Murim master&#x27; shudders.]</div>[Story, 'the tenacious Murim master' shudders.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The number and skill of the running enemies were excellent. It is only natural that they are the elite of the 7 kings of Seoul.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But do you think I will lose? If you ask me, I wouldn&#x27;t.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Does that mean I&#x27;ve become stronger?</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first glance, I thought that I was stronger than Kim Dokja of the same period, but I hadn&#x27;t had a chance to properly check my skills in the meantime.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, it wasn&#x27;t just that we were talking about the enemies.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Those two over there are strong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel it too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Two extraordinary auras were felt among them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Gu Taesung! This way! Move!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gu Taesung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One of the 7 kings of Seoul. A person who has Gyeonwon, the king of Later Baekje, as his background.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was a man called &#x27;The Dragon King&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Next to him was an incarnation wearing a black night suit, but I couldn&#x27;t guess who it was just by looking at his face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Assassin King. What&#x27;s the target?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Now it&#x27;s intelligent.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Assassin King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the entrance to the dungeon, the assassins who tried to harm us told us this name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Somehow, that man in the night suit seemed to be the leader of the rookie hunters.</p>

<p class="orv_line">A message I’ve seen before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the same case as the text book writer I met in the &#x27;Theatre Dungeon&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「It’s the Misreading association.」</div>「It’s the Misreading association.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Those who possessed characters here after illegally reading the novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From what I could see, both Gu Taesung, the Dragon King, and the Assassin King were all on that side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">ㅡbig star.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Dustman&#x27;s reaction also changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It probably means that the two of them have a &#x27;star jewel&#x27;. Shin Yoosoung, who was by my side, turned to the Dustman, placing her finger on her lips as if telling him to be quiet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Ahjussi, what should I do?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Let&#x27;s observe the situation for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo&#x27;s warning came to mind.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Brother, if you meet the 7 kings of Seoul, you must avoid them unconditionally.&quot;」</div>「"Brother, if you meet the 7 kings of Seoul, you must avoid them unconditionally."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Until now, I thought so. It was important to collect star jewels, but I had no intention of taking unnecessary risks with Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Isn&#x27;t that worth fighting for?」</div>「Isn't that worth fighting for?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I asked why that thought came to my mind, I was comparing them to someone without realizing it.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;The Last Ark&#x27; laughs.]</div>[The constellation 'The Last Ark' laughs.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, the king of beggars I faced at Seoul Station was the body of a constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how strong the 7 kings of Seoul are, they are only the incarnations of a great constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a sense, I&#x27;ve already had a record of dealing with a first-class incarnation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was thinking about whether to attack now, but I decided to eavesdrop on their conversation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What about troop losses?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There were a few minor injuries, but no fatalities.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No fatalities?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Intermittent murmurings could be heard from a distance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a vibration I had heard before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you not hear? He said he doesn&#x27;t kill anyone.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He’s not killing anyone.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There are rumors that they are members of the apostle side.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apostle?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#x27;t like their hypocrisy. It&#x27;s just like them and us who read a damn novel anyway.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s true. What&#x27;s the point of spending a few hundred won on that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I resisted the urge to go right away and slap him in the back of the head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, are you insane for talking about things like that?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A few constellations protest why there are so many filtered conversations these days.]</div>[A few constellations protest why there are so many filtered conversations these days.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s a conversation that is filtered anyway, so they don&#x27;t have any intention of hiding it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What happened to the possessed constellation? Have you been contacted?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No. Not yet. It looks like it&#x27;s been a bit of time.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You damn bastards. Then why mess with the First Sword of Goryeo?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They don&#x27;t even know the contents of their novels. We should have done the constellation possession.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the vibration that resonated with the labyrinth approached, the two men shut their mouths at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s coming.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The faces of the two people had a strange tension. Then came the sound of flesh being torn from the aisle and an horrible scream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, with the sound of gasping for breath, incarnations appeared. An incarnation with one arm ripped off. An incarnation with a broken shin. The incarnations who lost all their weapons ran this way in a hurry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even seeing the injured men, the two did not look too surprised.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if they had foreseen this situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is that what happens when you collect three star jewels?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you&#x27;re jealous, I&#x27;ll hand over my star jewel to you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I decline.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A gigantic figure swayed behind the avatars.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first glance, a gigantic creature that appears to be twice the size of an ordinary incarnation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Could that be the Labyrinth Keeper?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Dustman, who was spinning around, couldn&#x27;t control himself and shivered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">ㅡBig star!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not a Labyrinth Keeper.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, that monster is also an &#x27;incarnation&#x27; like us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, was there such an incarnation in Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung, who was next to me, was also holding on to my sleeve, as if surprised.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A slight tremor passed through the child&#x27;s fingertips.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That can&#x27;t be won.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The hairs on the backs of my hands were warning me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#x27;t see the form properly yet, but the giant in the darkness was stronger than Gu Taesung and the assassin king combined.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who the hell is it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this point, if it is an existence with a level of combat power that exceeds the &#x27;7 kings of Seoul&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Light!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Along with Gu Taesung&#x27;s cry, someone lit a light in the darkness of the underground passage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The giant&#x27;s face was revealed to the whole world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Arms filled with strong muscles.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Empty pupils as if he had lost his mind. Lips moving repeatedly as if chanting Buddhist prayers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will not kill you. I won&#x27;t kill you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard the voice, I got goosebumps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Ahjussi?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I forgot to reply to Shin Yoosoung and ran out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow! What is it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">One of the incarnations that spotted me jumping through the aisle brandished a blind knife.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After receiving the blade as it was, I tripped the incarnation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnation let out a small scream and fell down on the back of his head before making a pack sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did he die? I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, now was not the time to be immersed in sentimentality.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was looking at a giant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Looking for someone. I&#x27;m looking for someone.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why is that person here?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see her man&#x27;s thick hand poking through the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a different size, but it was a hand I knew well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The person who asked me where the bugs were. With that hand, he found the bug under the vending machine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Find someone.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It felt like a part of my chest was about to collapse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first reader I met after possessing someone in this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A man who was brought into this world for reading a novel his daughter was reading.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Noh Jiyoon. Noh Jiyoon.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jiyoon&#x27;s father.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Dansu ahjussi!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, as if he couldn&#x27;t hear my voice, he only repeated vain gestures toward the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you look closely, you can see that the old man&#x27;s eyes are black.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My breath choked, and deep anger and sorrow rushed at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What the hell happened in the meantime?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did Ahjussi become like that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What the hell kind of people made you like that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Could it be because of the life that flowed out in an instant? A group of incarnations looked back at my width.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see Gu Taesung and the Assassin King frowning at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw them face to face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Are these guys the ones who made you that way?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you a hindrance?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The assassin king who found me muttered in a calm voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, the sound of flesh breaking was heard from the front of the aisle.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The incarnation &#x27;Dansu&#x27; has currently acquired 3 Star Jewels.]</div>[The incarnation 'Dansu' has currently acquired 3 Star Jewels.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Every time Dansu Ahjussi swung his giant hand. The incarnations were helplessly swept away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m sorry. I&#x27;m sorry.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations who were hit by ahjussi were injured, but did not die. Moderate to minor injuries that do not end life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I won&#x27;t kill you. I won&#x27;t kill you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, Dansu ahjussi was like that from the first scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man who killed a bug in the first scenario has never killed a person.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;It&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m weak.&quot;」</div>「"It's just because I'm weak."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s what he said, but I knew why the old man didn&#x27;t really kill people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A man who is always looking for his daughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is only one reason why such a man does not kill people.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;I want Jiyoon to be proud of me.&quot;」</div>「"I want Jiyoon to be proud of me."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Dansu ahjussi! Calm down!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He looked around as if he still couldn&#x27;t hear me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One of the incarnations that had been paying attention suddenly attacked me from behind. However, the incarnation was struck in the neck by a dagger flying from the side and fell down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ahjussi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Shin Yoosoung. I nodded and looked around at the incarnations around me. No matter how I look at it, these guys are the ones who are aiming for Dansu ahjussi, so it was urgent to deal with these guys first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that Gu Taesung, who was checking his watch, raised his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think you misunderstood. We don&#x27;t intend to fight.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">You don&#x27;t want to fight?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy looked back at the members of his group who had fallen to me and Shin Yoosoung, then clicked his tongue and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on right now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Old Taesung. Don&#x27;t talk nonsense.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Despite the Assassin King&#x27;s warning, Gu Taesung looked at my width and continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Looks like you’re on the edge. Let me give you a piece of advice. You&#x27;d better get away from here quickly. Or you&#x27;ll get run over by that monster too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Gu Taesung. He&#x27;s here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, Gu Taesung and the Assassin King moved. I nervously grabbed the hilt of my sword. If I had to, I was thinking of cutting the backs of the kings to save ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Just throw food and it will fall.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead of grabbing weapons, Gu Taesung and the Assassin King reached out for their own Dustmen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">ㅡLight up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Two shining white jewels protruded from the little Dustman&#x27;s mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It must have been. It was the &#x27;Star Jewel&#x27; that we had been looking for all along.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the continued actions of the guys that made it happen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Eat it, you bastard!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">They threw their star jewels at Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m sorry. I&#x27;m sorry.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A star jewel flew towards the man who was repeating his apology into the air. After that, the Dustman, who was flying near ahjussi, opened his mouth wide.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation &#x27;Lee Dansu&#x27; gets 2 additional &#x27;Star Jewels&#x27;!]</div>[Incarnation 'Lee Dansu' gets 2 additional 'Star Jewels'!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, cracks began to appear all over ahjussi’s body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a crackling sound, ahjussi’s muscles were torn and swollen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Assassin King let out an unpleasant laugh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s a success.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Now just feed two more and we’re done. Everyone withdraw!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Assassin King and Gu Taesung&#x27;s group seemed to have finished their mission and didn&#x27;t look back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I heard it everywhere in the labyrinth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if, from the beginning, they had no intention of hunting him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#x27;t understand what the hell was going on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sorted out the situation in the confusion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One, Dansu ahjussi already had three star jewels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I were to simply summarize the situation that was happening right in front of my eyes, that would be it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They gave the star jewel to Dansu ahjussi on purpose.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why? He already had three star jewels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he gets two more star jewels in that situation, the old man will only become ridiculously strong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;By the way, was that all?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Belatedly, the rules of this dungeon came to mind.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>8. Every time you acquire 1 &#x27;Star Jewel&#x27;, the &#x27;Madness&#x27; level increases.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">No way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I approached Dansu ahjussi who was kneeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ahjussi! It&#x27;s me! Ahjussi!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi, who had grown even bigger than before, had now grown to the point of being reminiscent of a small giant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel his presence just by getting close.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if reminiscent of Yoo Jonghyuk, a sense of heavy pressure that chokes your breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To the old man who was crying and scratching the floor as if in pain, I stretched out my hands and shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Me, Cheon Inho! Take a seat!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the word Cheon Inho, the man raised his head. For an instant, hope welled up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Does he recognize me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi’s lips were saying something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jiyoon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The next moment, ahjussi’s huge palm flew towards me. It was a relentless blow with no chance to escape. If Shin Yoosoung hadn&#x27;t pulled my back just in time, I might have been crushed by it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at the floor where Dansu ahjussi’s palm had been planted. The floor was severely cracked with the palm at the center.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cold sweat ran down my back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was about to die. Really, I almost died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung, holding onto my sleeve, was shouting something, but I could only hear what ahjussi said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m sorry. I&#x27;m sorry.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A man who repeats an apology. The man who had lost both eyes looked at me with wide open pupils.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation &#x27;Lee Dansu&#x27; has fallen into &#x27;Madness Level 5&#x27;.]</div>[Incarnation 'Lee Dansu' has fallen into 'Madness Level 5'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Madness level 5.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>9. Every time the &#x27;Madness&#x27; stage goes up, the overall ability increases greatly and you lose your sanity.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did I understand why the 7 kings abandoned the star jewels and fled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The tenth rule came to mind soon after.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>10. If someone collects 7 Star Jewels, the Death Sword will be summoned.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Goosebumps ran down my spine.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The goal of this place was not to collect 7 jewels.」</div>「The goal of this place was not to collect 7 jewels.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#x27;star jewels&#x27; in this dungeon were a trap.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Star Jewels&#x27; that made one lose their reason in return for gaining strong power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, in order to properly collect &#x27;star jewels&#x27;, you should never collect &#x27;star jewels&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Therefore, the goal of this dungeon was as follows.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「To make someone other than yourself collect &#x27;7 star jewels&#x27;.」</div>「To make someone other than yourself collect '7 star jewels'.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi, who became a monster, slowly got up and started walking towards me.</p>
