<p class="orv_line">What happened?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why on earth is Yoo Joonghyuk in the time fault of the &#x27;40th round&#x27;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much I thought about it, there was no reason for it. The last time I parted ways with him was at the entrance of the Fear Realm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I left the guy who hadn&#x27;t fully recovered to Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and fell into the Fear Realm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the guy followed me into the Fear Realm, our paths crossed, and he arrived at this &#x27;Transcendent Alliance&#x27; before me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And then he entered the time fault of the &#x27;40th round&#x27;. Why on earth?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Yoo Joonghyuk lost his memories from the 40th round.」</div>「Yoo Joonghyuk lost his memories from the 40th round.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth at the sudden thought. Now that I think about it, Yoo Jonhhyuk forgot most of what happened in the 40th round as a side effect of the &#x27;Story Imprint&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What if he came to this &#x27;fault&#x27; to get them back?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt suffocated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn it. Joonghyuk. Even so, what are you going to do if you challenge this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the 99th scenario of the 40th round, Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s &#x27;incarnation body&#x27; obviously won&#x27;t exist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it&#x27;s as we saw in Anna&#x27;s [Past Sight], Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s incarnation body was defeated by Cheon Inho before the last scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, it was highly likely that Yoo Joonghyuk had possessed another incarnation and had performed the mission of the time fault.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn bastard, I&#x27;d rather challenge that &#x27;fault&#x27; above.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Round 1863-99.]</div>[Round 1863-99.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I look at it again, it&#x27;s a dizzying number, but if it were Yoo Joonghyuk now, it would have been better to challenge that side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the 99th scenario of the 1,863rd round, if he was lucky, he could have possessed Yoo Joonghyuk in the 1,863rd round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It seems that &#x27;fault&#x27; is visible to you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Chungheo, who had suddenly appeared beside me, muttered while stroking his beard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, didn&#x27;t Ryunard say it? That fault can&#x27;t be seen by anyone.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Chungheo continued in a strangely dissonant voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This world&#x27;s &#x27;fault&#x27; can only be seen by those like me who came from outside, or by the recorders who watch the world line. How strange. No newcomer has discovered that &#x27;fault&#x27; until now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only after hearing that did it occur to me that maybe Yoo Joonghyuk hadn&#x27;t discovered that fault.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps the incarnations from the 41st world line had a set type of &#x27;fault&#x27; that they could utilize.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some faults are visible, and some are invisible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as you can&#x27;t experience an event that you haven&#x27;t experienced yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, all of those events clearly exist &#x27;together&#x27;...</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ll say it again, you don&#x27;t have to feel burdened. I can just press the reset button after everything is over. I’ve done that many times before.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No. That’s the same as &#x27;regression&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Regression?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t want to save my comrade that way.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Your comrade—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He&#x27;s definitely still alive.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The monitor on the time rift wasn’t showing anything. But I trust Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was none other than Yoo Joonghyuk of the &#x27;41st round&#x27;. There’s no way he would have entered the 40th round without thinking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And I’m not going in alone, Kim Anna-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, who was trying to sneak away from behind at my call, turned around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you in your right mind?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You’re not going with me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t have an &#x27;incarnation body&#x27; in that &#x27;fault&#x27;. If we go in together—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You can possess any incarnation and use it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That might not work! Didn’t you hear what the seniors explained? If you recklessly enter a time rift without a proper incarnation body…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If the soul doesn&#x27;t settle down, it could become an Outer God.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If we were not careful, both Kim Anna and I could have been stuffed with &#x27;Catastrophic Fear&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But she couldn&#x27;t refuse this offer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aren&#x27;t you curious about the ending of scenarios number 99?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m saying that you&#x27;re curious about what I, Cheon Inho, saw at the end of that damned 40th round.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You really...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m a coward. So please be fooled by that cowardice one more time. I think I need you to see the ending of that &#x27;time fault&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If we&#x27;re going to see the ending in this round, we absolutely have to know what happened in the 40th round.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I silently grabbed Anna&#x27;s wrist. Anna Croft sighed deeply and looked at Chunghuh with pitiful eyes as if asking for help.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at Chunghuh and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Please delay the end until I return. Please.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait! Wait! Cheon Inho! Aah—&quot;</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The two people disappeared beyond the swirling door. Someone approached Chunghuh, who was silently watching the door close in an instant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Master.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Karlton.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Karlton, who had the heads of Outer Gods lined up in a silver chain, stood behind him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It seems the newbies have come in.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why didn&#x27;t you stop him? This isn&#x27;t a time fault that two newbies can handle.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s not like anything will change even if they&#x27;re here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That fault belongs to the &#x27;Recorder of Fear&#x27;. If you get trapped inside, you can&#x27;t come back even if you press the &#x27;reset&#x27; button.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He said he hated regression.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Chunghuh laughed silently and looked up into the air, then spoke again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Jaehwan, that guy hated &#x27;regression&#x27; to the point of death.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Karlton also hesitated at the name Jaehwan.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Chunghuh continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That guy also climbed that high tower to save his friend.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Karlton also knew well what that &#x27;tower&#x27; was. The tower and the world they knew had already disappeared, but the back of someone climbing that tower was vivid in their memories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He was the guy who climbed the difficult path that no one took, even though there was an easy path.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Karlton smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Longing. In this Fear Realm, it was an emotion that was endlessly vague and, above all, powerful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It reminds me of the old days. Do you think the newbies will succeed?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;In this &#x27;End Zone&#x27; where everything is useless, do success and failure have much meaning?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A wave of Outer Gods gathered like clouds in the sky and surged toward the transcendents.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Chunghuh silently drew his sword and began to slash at the air with a grin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I just hope he finds a &#x27;good story&#x27; in this cliche end.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment he said that, the Outer Gods&#x27; heads all turned somewhere.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The &#x27;King of Fear&#x27;s&#x27; gaze moved.]</div>[The 'King of Fear's' gaze moved.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Outer Gods who followed their master were looking in the same direction as their master. That direction was, of course, where the &#x27;40th round&#x27; time fault was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Chunghuh added with a smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe he&#x27;s already found it.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have possessed a suitable &#x27;incarnation body.&#x27;]</div>[You have possessed a suitable 'incarnation body.']</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a familiar feeling. The same feeling as when I entered &#x27;fear&#x27; through the captain of the &#x27;subway on the way home from work&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The final chapter of ■■-grade Fear, &#x27;Evil Sophist&#x27;, has begun.]</div>[The final chapter of ■■-grade Fear, 'Evil Sophist', has begun.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that time, I was disguised as a masked person of the Blood Cult who was chasing Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what is this now?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Warning! Your incarnation body is in a very unstable state!]</div>[Warning! Your incarnation body is in a very unstable state!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought I possessed Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In addition, the incarnation&#x27;s stories were completely destroyed, so it wouldn&#x27;t be strange if I collapsed right away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Anna-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quietly called out to Anna Croft, but Anna didn&#x27;t respond.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After briefly calling her, who might have become a &#x27;Disaster-level Fear&#x27; Anna Croft by now, I slowly got up from my seat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that moment, something brushed past my head with a thud.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An arrow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was an arrow with an unusual &#x27;force&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s close! There&#x27;s a guy nearby!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging from the aftermath of the arrow&#x27;s landing, they were incarnations with great energy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They must be chasing Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had to run away somehow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if the incarnation body was like this, running away was nothing. No matter what, this body was Cheon Inho who survived until the &#x27;last scenario&#x27;...</p>
<p class="orv_line">Squeak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I almost tripped and fell.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why is this kid’s incarnation body still so weak? Is he really like Kim Dokja VER.2?</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, but it&#x27;s scenario number 99, so how can his incarnation body be this weak?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your infirmity increases due to the influence of the exclusive trait &#x27;Disease Acceleration&#x27;.]</div>[Your infirmity increases due to the influence of the exclusive trait 'Disease Acceleration'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">It even seemed like his overall ability was lower than the last time I possessed him.</p>

<p class="orv_line">My mind became complicated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No. Even though his basic overall ability is low, he rode the combination of 「Disease Acceleration」 and 「Weak Tongue」 as his exclusive traits?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Are you crazy?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Find it! Near here—]</div>[Find it! Near here—]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wait a minute. 「Disease Acceleration」 and 「Weak Tongue」. If I think about it carefully, I understand why he had these exclusive traits.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Disease Acceleration is a trait that makes all traits&#x27; &#x27;repeated cooldowns&#x27; zero in exchange for drastically worsening his status abnormalities.」</div>「Disease Acceleration is a trait that makes all traits' 'repeated cooldowns' zero in exchange for drastically worsening his status abnormalities.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">On top of that, 「Weak Tongue」 is a trait that increases the speed and power of &#x27;Speech&#x27;-related skills in exchange for lowering his overall ability by half.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Combining these two allows for the so-called 「Magic Rapid Fire」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Cheon Inho was not a magician, but an &#x27;Instigator&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, this was a trait combination created with the idea of ​​casting [Incite] first before the opponent could do anything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was impressed by Cheon Inho&#x27;s boldness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It’s a &#x27;trait combination&#x27; that could send you to the afterlife with just one hit in this scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much I think about it, this is a method that only someone as crazy as Kim Dokja could possibly use.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There! Over there!]</div>[There! Over there!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">And I was that crazy Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though I was a total wreck, even though my incarnation body was a mess and my body was at the level of Kim Dokja — it was none other than the body of Cheon Inho, the &#x27;One who Deceived the Stars&#x27; and the &#x27;Evil Sophist&#x27; in the 40th round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I have [Incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it&#x27;s not another [Incite], but Cheon Inho&#x27;s [Incite] that reached the end of the scenarios, what can&#x27;t it do?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just like I did with the Blood Demon, I can make them all kneel with subtle gaslighting and then crack the back of their heads.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I think that and get up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I finally found you, Cheon Inho.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">What the heck, the Blood Demon I met last time was standing there again. Ah, was this kid alive?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, I didn&#x27;t listen to what he said and immediately activated [Incite].</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill, &#x27;Incite Lv.???&#x27;, is activated!]</div>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.???', is activated!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Incite, which is displayed as &#x27;level ???&#x27;. I was about to be amazed by his incredible skill.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your incarnation&#x27;s durability is currently at its limit.]</div>[Your incarnation's durability is currently at its limit.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your incarnation cannot use this skill at present.]</div>[Your incarnation cannot use this skill at present.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tried to smile and took a step back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn it, I should have tried this before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered why my incarnation body ended up like this, but it seems I had already been using [Incite] vigorously somewhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I waved my hand as if I was greeting a friend I hadn&#x27;t seen in a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, nice to meet you, Blood Demon.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Nice to meet you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Blood Demon said with a grin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. Nice to meet you. Cheon Inho, I am grateful to you back then.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re grateful for, but I&#x27;m glad. Then, would you mind throwing me some of the remaining herbs? If possible, it would be better if it were the Blood Spirits you gave me before.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Blood Demon&#x27;s eyebrows furrowed at my words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Damn you. Anyway, thanks to you, I&#x27;ve finally gotten one step closer to the [Regression Law].&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah, that ridiculous Regression Law. You&#x27;re still researching it, aren&#x27;t you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly took a step back, looking around. However, no matter where I looked, the Blood Demon&#x27;s subordinates were already surrounding me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a disaster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d die in the &#x27;final scenario&#x27; to the Blood Demon, not Zeus or Poseidon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yeah, it&#x27;s all thanks to you defeating Poseidon.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who did I defeat?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Blood Demon looked at me like I was crazy. Only then did I understand why my incarnation body had become like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did I have a fight with Poseidon of &lt;Olympus&gt;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I even took that bastard down?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#x27;t know what kind of scheme you&#x27;re plotting, but it won&#x27;t work this time. So put down that thing you stole from &lt;Olympus&gt; and get out.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thing? Only then did I notice the thing shaking around the waist of my coat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you give me that, I&#x27;ll really let you live this time.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared blankly down at the thing in question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it was some kind of secret trick left by Cheon Inho, but the moment I confirmed it, I cursed without realizing it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This damn thing.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s head was hanging from my waist.</p>
