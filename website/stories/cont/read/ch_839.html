            <div class="orv_title"><h1>839 Episode 44 Evil Sophist (2)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">What happened?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why on earth is Yoo Joonghyuk in the time fault of the &#39;40th round&#39;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much I thought about it, there was no reason for it. The last time I parted ways with him was at the entrance of the Fear Realm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I left the guy who hadn&#39;t fully recovered to Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and fell into the Fear Realm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the guy followed me into the Fear Realm, our paths crossed, and he arrived at this &#39;Transcendent Alliance&#39; before me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And then he entered the time fault of the &#39;40th round&#39;. Why on earth?</p>
「Yoo Joonghyuk lost his memories from the 40th round.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth at the sudden thought. Now that I think about it, Yoo Jonhhyuk forgot most of what happened in the 40th round as a side effect of the &#39;Story Imprint&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What if he came to this &#39;fault&#39; to get them back?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt suffocated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn it. Joonghyuk. Even so, what are you going to do if you challenge this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the 99th scenario of the 40th round, Yoo Joonghyuk&#39;s &#39;incarnation body&#39; obviously won&#39;t exist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it&#39;s as we saw in Anna&#39;s [Past Sight], Yoo Joonghyuk&#39;s incarnation body was defeated by Cheon Inho before the last scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, it was highly likely that Yoo Joonghyuk had possessed another incarnation and had performed the mission of the time fault.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn bastard, I&#39;d rather challenge that &#39;fault&#39; above.</p>
[Round 1863-99.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I look at it again, it&#39;s a dizzying number, but if it were Yoo Joonghyuk now, it would have been better to challenge that side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the 99th scenario of the 1,863rd round, if he was lucky, he could have possessed Yoo Joonghyuk in the 1,863rd round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It seems that &#39;fault&#39; is visible to you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Chungheo, who had suddenly appeared beside me, muttered while stroking his beard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, didn&#39;t Ryunard say it? That fault can&#39;t be seen by anyone.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Chungheo continued in a strangely dissonant voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This world&#39;s &#39;fault&#39; can only be seen by those like me who came from outside, or by the recorders who watch the world line. How strange. No newcomer has discovered that &#39;fault&#39; until now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only after hearing that did it occur to me that maybe Yoo Joonghyuk hadn&#39;t discovered that fault.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps the incarnations from the 41st world line had a set type of &#39;fault&#39; that they could utilize.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some faults are visible, and some are invisible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as you can&#39;t experience an event that you haven&#39;t experienced yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, all of those events clearly exist &#39;together&#39;...</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;ll say it again, you don&#39;t have to feel burdened. I can just press the reset button after everything is over. I’ve done that many times before.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No. That’s the same as &#39;regression&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Regression?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t want to save my comrade that way.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Your comrade—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He&#39;s definitely still alive.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The monitor on the time rift wasn’t showing anything. But I trust Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was none other than Yoo Joonghyuk of the &#39;41st round&#39;. There’s no way he would have entered the 40th round without thinking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And I’m not going in alone, Kim Anna-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, who was trying to sneak away from behind at my call, turned around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you in your right mind?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You’re not going with me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t have an &#39;incarnation body&#39; in that &#39;fault&#39;. If we go in together—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You can possess any incarnation and use it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That might not work! Didn’t you hear what the seniors explained? If you recklessly enter a time rift without a proper incarnation body…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If the soul doesn&#39;t settle down, it could become an Outer God.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If we were not careful, both Kim Anna and I could have been stuffed with &#39;Catastrophic Fear&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But she couldn&#39;t refuse this offer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aren&#39;t you curious about the ending of scenarios number 99?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m saying that you&#39;re curious about what I, Cheon Inho, saw at the end of that damned 40th round.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You really...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m a coward. So please be fooled by that cowardice one more time. I think I need you to see the ending of that &#39;time fault&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If we&#39;re going to see the ending in this round, we absolutely have to know what happened in the 40th round.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I silently grabbed Anna&#39;s wrist. Anna Croft sighed deeply and looked at Chunghuh with pitiful eyes as if asking for help.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at Chunghuh and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Please delay the end until I return. Please.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait! Wait! Cheon Inho! Aah—&quot;</p>
[Entering &#39;round 40-99&#39;.]</p></div>
[The &#39;time fault&#39; belongs to the &#39;Recorder of Fear, Evil Sophist&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
[■■-grade Fear, &#39;Evil Sophist&#39;, allows you and one other person to enter.]</p></div>
[The &#39;time fault&#39; opens.]</p></div>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The two people disappeared beyond the swirling door. Someone approached Chunghuh, who was silently watching the door close in an instant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Master.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Karlton.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Karlton, who had the heads of Outer Gods lined up in a silver chain, stood behind him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It seems the newbies have come in.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why didn&#39;t you stop him? This isn&#39;t a time fault that two newbies can handle.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s not like anything will change even if they&#39;re here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That fault belongs to the &#39;Recorder of Fear&#39;. If you get trapped inside, you can&#39;t come back even if you press the &#39;reset&#39; button.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He said he hated regression.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Chunghuh laughed silently and looked up into the air, then spoke again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Jaehwan, that guy hated &#39;regression&#39; to the point of death.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Karlton also hesitated at the name Jaehwan.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Chunghuh continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That guy also climbed that high tower to save his friend.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Karlton also knew well what that &#39;tower&#39; was. The tower and the world they knew had already disappeared, but the back of someone climbing that tower was vivid in their memories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He was the guy who climbed the difficult path that no one took, even though there was an easy path.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Karlton smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Longing. In this Fear Realm, it was an emotion that was endlessly vague and, above all, powerful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It reminds me of the old days. Do you think the newbies will succeed?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;In this &#39;End Zone&#39; where everything is useless, do success and failure have much meaning?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A wave of Outer Gods gathered like clouds in the sky and surged toward the transcendents.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Chunghuh silently drew his sword and began to slash at the air with a grin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I just hope he finds a &#39;good story&#39; in this cliche end.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment he said that, the Outer Gods&#39; heads all turned somewhere.</p>
[The &#39;King of Fear&#39;s&#39; gaze moved.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Outer Gods who followed their master were looking in the same direction as their master. That direction was, of course, where the &#39;40th round&#39; time fault was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Chunghuh added with a smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe he&#39;s already found it.&quot;</p>
<hr>
[You have possessed a suitable &#39;incarnation body.&#39;]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a familiar feeling. The same feeling as when I entered &#39;fear&#39; through the captain of the &#39;subway on the way home from work&#39;.</p>
[The final chapter of ■■-grade Fear, &#39;Evil Sophist&#39;, has begun.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At that time, I was disguised as a masked person of the Blood Cult who was chasing Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what is this now?</p>
[Warning! Your incarnation body is in a very unstable state!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I thought I possessed Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In addition, the incarnation&#39;s stories were completely destroyed, so it wouldn&#39;t be strange if I collapsed right away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Anna-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quietly called out to Anna Croft, but Anna didn&#39;t respond.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After briefly calling her, who might have become a &#39;Disaster-level Fear&#39; Anna Croft by now, I slowly got up from my seat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that moment, something brushed past my head with a thud.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An arrow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was an arrow with an unusual &#39;force&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s close! There&#39;s a guy nearby!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging from the aftermath of the arrow&#39;s landing, they were incarnations with great energy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They must be chasing Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had to run away somehow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if the incarnation body was like this, running away was nothing. No matter what, this body was Cheon Inho who survived until the &#39;last scenario&#39;...</p>
<p class="orv_line">Squeak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I almost tripped and fell.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why is this kid’s incarnation body still so weak? Is he really like Kim Dokja VER.2?</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, but it&#39;s scenario number 99, so how can his incarnation body be this weak?</p>
[Your infirmity increases due to the influence of the exclusive trait &#39;Disease Acceleration&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It even seemed like his overall ability was lower than the last time I possessed him.</p>
[Your overall ability has been greatly reduced due to the influence of the exclusive trait &#39;Weak Tongue&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My mind became complicated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No. Even though his basic overall ability is low, he rode the combination of 「Disease Acceleration」 and 「Weak Tongue」 as his exclusive traits?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Are you crazy?</p>
[Find it! Near here—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Wait a minute. 「Disease Acceleration」 and 「Weak Tongue」. If I think about it carefully, I understand why he had these exclusive traits.</p>
「Disease Acceleration is a trait that makes all traits&#39; &#39;repeated cooldowns&#39; zero in exchange for drastically worsening his status abnormalities.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">On top of that, 「Weak Tongue」 is a trait that increases the speed and power of &#39;Speech&#39;-related skills in exchange for lowering his overall ability by half.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Combining these two allows for the so-called 「Magic Rapid Fire」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Cheon Inho was not a magician, but an &#39;Instigator&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, this was a trait combination created with the idea of ​​casting [Incite] first before the opponent could do anything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was impressed by Cheon Inho&#39;s boldness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It’s a &#39;trait combination&#39; that could send you to the afterlife with just one hit in this scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much I think about it, this is a method that only someone as crazy as Kim Dokja could possibly use.</p>
[There! Over there!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And I was that crazy Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though I was a total wreck, even though my incarnation body was a mess and my body was at the level of Kim Dokja — it was none other than the body of Cheon Inho, the &#39;One who Deceived the Stars&#39; and the &#39;Evil Sophist&#39; in the 40th round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I have [Incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it&#39;s not another [Incite], but Cheon Inho&#39;s [Incite] that reached the end of the scenarios, what can&#39;t it do?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just like I did with the Blood Demon, I can make them all kneel with subtle gaslighting and then crack the back of their heads.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I think that and get up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I finally found you, Cheon Inho.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">What the heck, the Blood Demon I met last time was standing there again. Ah, was this kid alive?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, I didn&#39;t listen to what he said and immediately activated [Incite].</p>
[Exclusive skill, &#39;Incite Lv.???&#39;, is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Incite, which is displayed as &#39;level ???&#39;. I was about to be amazed by his incredible skill.</p>
[Your incarnation&#39;s durability is currently at its limit.]</p></div>
[Your incarnation cannot use this skill at present.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I tried to smile and took a step back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn it, I should have tried this before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered why my incarnation body ended up like this, but it seems I had already been using [Incite] vigorously somewhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I waved my hand as if I was greeting a friend I hadn&#39;t seen in a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, nice to meet you, Blood Demon.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Nice to meet you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Blood Demon said with a grin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. Nice to meet you. Cheon Inho, I am grateful to you back then.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re grateful for, but I&#39;m glad. Then, would you mind throwing me some of the remaining herbs? If possible, it would be better if it were the Blood Spirits you gave me before.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Blood Demon&#39;s eyebrows furrowed at my words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Damn you. Anyway, thanks to you, I&#39;ve finally gotten one step closer to the [Regression Law].&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah, that ridiculous Regression Law. You&#39;re still researching it, aren&#39;t you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly took a step back, looking around. However, no matter where I looked, the Blood Demon&#39;s subordinates were already surrounding me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a disaster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d die in the &#39;final scenario&#39; to the Blood Demon, not Zeus or Poseidon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s all thanks to you defeating Poseidon.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who did I defeat?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Blood Demon looked at me like I was crazy. Only then did I understand why my incarnation body had become like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did I have a fight with Poseidon of &lt;Olympus&gt;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I even took that bastard down?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t know what kind of scheme you&#39;re plotting, but it won&#39;t work this time. So put down that thing you stole from &lt;Olympus&gt; and get out.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thing? Only then did I notice the thing shaking around the waist of my coat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you give me that, I&#39;ll really let you live this time.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared blankly down at the thing in question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it was some kind of secret trick left by Cheon Inho, but the moment I confirmed it, I cursed without realizing it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This damn thing.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk&#39;s head was hanging from my waist.</p>
