            <div class="orv_title"><h1>868 Episode 47 King of Fear (12)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sky was splitting apart like a canvas. Beyond the shattered snowfield sky, a pitch-black energy could be seen flying. No, I don’t know if that can be called &#39;energy&#39;. What was certain was that it was tearing apart the sky of this world.</p>
[Wow.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That was Jaehwan’s stab.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung muttered in admiration.</p>
[This is the first time I’ve seen something like that in my life.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This is the &#39;Snowfield&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it was Jaehwan, the slayer of monarchs, it wouldn’t be easy to enter here to deal with Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what if he could attack the &#39;Snowfield&#39; itself from outside of the &#39;Snowfield&#39;?</p>
「Tearing the Constellations.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If Jaehwan’s secret technique could shatter space and time, he thought it might be possible to temporarily dismantle the lines of this &#39;Snowfield&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, the gamble seemed to have paid off.</p>
【How—】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the astonished Asmodeus turned around, he saw the two Kim Dokjas floating in the air disappear. They also sensed the danger.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kwakwakwakwakwa!</p>
<p class="orv_line">That thing is flying out of the air, and I don’t know how to get out of here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The [□□] skill that determines entry into the snowfield was not listening, and contact with the first Kim Dokja through the [Fourth Wall] was also cut off.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was only one person I could trust right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Please save me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung said, her eyes widening at my request.</p>
[The Kim Dokja I know isn’t as shameless as you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung smiled and hugged me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The next moment, my vision went blank and I was thrown out of the snowfield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that I think about it, I wasn’t sure if I could return to my body like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My body is currently illegally occupied by Cheon Inho. No. Originally, that body belonged to Cheon Inho, so was it me who was occupying it illegally?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hmph.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my eyes wide, wiping the saliva flowing from my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What is it? How did I come back?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before I could even properly ask the question, a terrible pain shot through my stomach and other parts of my body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swallowed the pain and quickly looked around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was the &#39;big house&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If that&#39;s true, the scars left all over my body must have been from the fight with Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grabbed my stomach, which was leaking blood, and frowned.</p>
[The exclusive skill, &#39;Fourth Wall&#39;, is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At least the [Fourth Wall] was reactivated, relieving the pain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk, how much did you beat him up?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I crouched and held my hands on the floor, catching my breath. My knees were shaking, so I couldn&#39;t even get up. How on earth did Cheon Inho fight with this body?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheon Inho?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I raised my head, Anna Croft, covered in dust, was standing there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled and waved my hand toward her, who was already raising her spirits with wary eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ms. Kim Anna.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, who was startled, blinked her eyes in astonishment. Her eyes seemed to suspect that I was tricking her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled and continued to speak with narrowed eyes to help her make her judgment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Have you forgotten your own name?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;...Are you back?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
[Character, &#39;Anna Croft&#39;, is activating &#39;Lie Detection Lv. 10&#39;.]</p></div>
[&#39;Lie Detection&#39; has confirmed that what you said is true.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even in the midst of all that, she even had the sense to utilize [Lie Detection]. As expected, it was the quick reflexes of a prophet. Anna Croft, who confirmed that I was not the &#39;real Cheon Inho&#39;, ran over and grabbed my hands and supported me. Then she stood there awkwardly, as if she didn&#39;t know what to do, and lowered her head. I doubled over because I found the situation funny.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You were worried, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought she would naturally object strongly, but Anna Croft unexpectedly answered in a heavy voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel her sincerity in her tone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, we had been through a lot together, going through the fears of the Fear Realm and the Transcendent Alliance.</p>
[Your giant tale is stirring.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">To build such a bond with that &#39;prophet&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Yoo Joonghyuk had heard it, he would have been shocked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quietly let go of her hand and looked around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Where is Yoo Joonghyuk?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The tyrant is…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Following her gaze, I saw Yoo Joonghyuk lying on the floor. I hurriedly approached the guy and checked his pulse and breathing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though I shook his shoulder, Yoo Joonghyuk didn&#39;t wake up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He&#39;s been like that since a while ago. No matter how much I try to wake him up, he doesn&#39;t respond at all.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had a rough idea.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Snowfield&#39; where the Kim Dokjas fought fiercely was Yoo Joonghyuk&#39;s inner world. However, since that world was torn apart for a moment by Jaehwan&#39;s blow, there was a possibility that the shock had affected Yoo Joonghyuk&#39;s reality.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;ll be okay. I think he just fainted for a moment.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he was really in a dangerous state, stories would have been running wild all over his body by now. However, his stories were surprisingly calm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What happened to Cheon Inho?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft asked back at my question as if it was absurd.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you asking me that while you&#39;re in that body?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft shook her head at my shameless attitude.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t know exactly. I saw the King defeat Cheon Inho, but...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What happened to his soul? Where did it disappear to?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The &#39;Eyes of the Great Demon&#39; can&#39;t see that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it was Yoo Joonghyuk, he wouldn&#39;t have a way to destroy Cheon Inho&#39;s soul at that moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That means Cheon Inho voluntarily gave up his body to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was hard for me to figure out his intentions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho, who had a deeper love and hate for the main character than anyone else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did that &#39;Evil Sophist&#39; who struggled to be recorded on the &#39;Last Wall&#39; give up his body again at a crucial moment?</p>
<p class="orv_line">...That&#39;s okay. It&#39;s not something that I can answer even if I think about it now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft, who had pulled up my sleeve, pointed her finger toward the cliff. The outside scenario area was reflected on the fault screen of the cliff.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Kuaaaah!</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Run! Run away!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Outer Gods still held sway under the protection of the Fear Realm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But upon closer inspection, the situation was a little different than before.</p>
[The constellation, &#39;God of Wine and Ecstasy&#39;, appears in the scenario area!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The message from the constellations striking the scenario area. Although it was not a full descent but a half-descent, the intervention of the constellations in the scenario was still a spectacle.</p>
[The constellation, &#39;Maritime War God&#39;, appears in the scenario area!]</p></div>
[The constellation, &#39;King of Gold&#39;, appears in the scenario area!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Taking advantage of the gap in the probability scale due to the Fear Realm, the constellations appeared in the scenario and fought against the Outer Gods.</p>
[The constellation, &#39;Master of the Guillotine&#39;, descends into the scenario area!]</p></div>
[The constellation, &#39;Snake Slicer&#39;, descends into the scenario area!]</p></div>
[The constellation, &#39;Soundless Sword&#39;, descends into the scenario area!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Under the command of the constellations, the Outer Gods of the Fear Realm began to push back little by little toward the portal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The enthusiasm of the incarnations responding to them was also great.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Oh!</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The constellations have arrived!</p>
<p class="orv_line">—That&#39;s it! Just push a little harder!</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was expected. The constellations that had been hiding until now are now appearing in the scenario area to help them, so the incarnations cannot help but be moved.</p>
[The fame of the constellations in the Korean Peninsula is rising!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, even if the scale of probability was broken, it was surprising that the constellations themselves stepped forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations probably had their own calculations. There may have been an agreement with the &#39;Giant Nebulae&#39;, or there may have been a behind-the-scenes deal with the Administration.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In any case, they were working on the scenario with one mind and one heart for once.</p>
【Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Nameless Things&#39; writhing in pain was running inside the portal again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shouted at the top of my lungs into the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Second brother! Let&#39;s stop now!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how many powerful Outer Gods remained in the second Kim Dokja&#39;s Fear Realm, he couldn&#39;t fight against the entire &lt;Star Stream&gt;. In the end, he would lose and his Fear Realm would be sealed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If we keep fighting like this, we&#39;ll all die! You didn&#39;t become the &#39;King of Fear&#39; to see this kind of thing!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did he hear my voice?</p>
<p class="orv_line">An ominous fog swirled around the center of the large house, and soon the &#39;King of Fear&#39; appeared. Perhaps because of the battle in the snowfield, his expression looked very exhausted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;O Watcher of Light and Darkness!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shouted his modifier. But he didn&#39;t look back at me. Instead, he was looking up at the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When did it start?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sky reflected in his compound eyes was splitting apart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did I realize what was happening.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ceiling of the large house was collapsing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh my God.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft muttered as she backed away in fear. After checking the dark clouds hanging over the collapsed ceiling, I hurriedly looked for Jang Hayoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Jang Hayoung!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung appeared as the empty space behind her rippled. As expected, her expression was clearly bewildered.</p>
[Isn&#39;t that flying back again?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first, I thought Jaehwan had been angry at my message and was stabbing me again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But something was different. Unlike Jaehwan&#39;s dry stab, the story that was now breaking through the ceiling was clearly filled with malice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The next moment, a flash of light flew through the crack in the ceiling. The floor of the &#39;Big House&#39; was on fire with enormous heat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Smoke spread acridly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swallowed my cough and looked up at the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The enormous power of a story condensed in the flash. It was a &#39;giant story&#39; that felt familiar somewhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No way.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As hundreds of flashes bombarded the &#39;Big House&#39;, Jang Hayoung finally stepped forward.</p>
[Damn it, Kim Dokja! Step back!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">An enormous force flowed out from Jang Hayoung&#39;s entire body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized once again why Jang Hayoung was called the &#39;King of the Transcendents&#39;. The story surging from her entire body was proving who she was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The [Invisible Sword] that Jang Hayoung created drew a translucent trajectory and pointed at the ceiling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Breaking the Sky Sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Seasonal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Pacheonseonggyeol.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship]&#39;s seasonal, Pacheonryuseonggyeol, collided with the flash like a rising meteor. The Pacheonryuseonggyeol&#39;s strong energy, which was offset by the flash, soon lost its strength and began to break apart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung did not stop.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jeon Inhwa.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Baek Cheongmun&#39;s secret technique, [Jeon Inhwa], was activated, and Jang Hayoung&#39;s entire body was covered with Baek Cheong&#39;s aura. Baek Cheong&#39;s tension poured out from her fist with a fierce explosion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the moment when the momentum was faltering, Jang Hayoung moved the formless sword once again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The third form.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The three swords of Cheok Jungyeong, created to cut the sea, exploded in Jang Hayoung&#39;s swordplay.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The harmony of [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship], [Jeon Inhwa], and [Samgeom-sik].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung was drawing a landscape that three captains of the Transcendent Alliance could create on their own.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was the true power of the &#39;King of Transcendents&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung&#39;s three swords, which finally pushed away the flash, detonated something beyond the ceiling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel the fierce waves of stories that shook the axis of the earth gradually diminishing.</p>
[Damn, if only there were no probability constraints—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It seems that Jang Hayoung cannot unleash 100% of her power in exchange for crossing the world line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, when the dust cleared, Jang Hayoung was still firmly holding her position. Although her entire body was burnt black, she succeeded in defending the &#39;Big House&#39; alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Jang Hayoung&#39;s expression was serious.</p>
[You...]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Her eyes were filled with anger as she confirmed with her own eyes the being that appeared through the crack in the ceiling.</p>
[How dare you. Do you know where this is?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, the sound of something firing was heard from beyond the crack once again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung, whose complexion had changed, turned around and shouted.</p>
[Kim Dokja, run away—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With a dazzling flash of lightning, Jang Hayoung&#39;s body crashed into the floor of the &#39;Big House&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was unbelievable. There was an entity out there that could take down Jang Hayoung, the &#39;King of the Transcendents&#39;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Once again, the ceiling of the &#39;Big House&#39; shook, and the sound of something squeezing into the ceiling was heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kkuddeuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dozens of ships appeared beyond the broken ceiling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew those ships well, too. The &#39;Story Weapons&#39; of the giant nebula that I witnessed in the final scenario of the 40th round.</p>
[The probability of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; is moving!]</p></div>
[The constellations of the small and medium nebulaes are astonished by the appearance of the great being!]</p></div>
[A probability aftermath is blowing!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The ship of &lt;Olympus&gt;, the &#39;Argo&#39;, took the lead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I confirmed the constellation leading them from the front, I thought I would accept Jang Hayoung&#39;s defeat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why on earth did that being appear here now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first, with an ominous feeling of foreboding, I felt as if the god aboard the &#39;Argo&#39; recognized me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that couldn&#39;t be the case.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fierce battle I had with him all happened in the time rift of the &#39;40th round&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, wait a minute.</p>
「What if I&#39;m not the only one who got the information of the &#39;40th round&#39; through the &#39;Time Fault&#39;?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Damn it.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Seat of Lightning&#39; reveals its status!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Olympus&gt;&#39;s strongest, Zeus, one of the three gods, aimed his holy relic, Astraphe, at the &#39;Great House&#39;.</p>
[Retrieve the fragment.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The incantation fell.</p>
