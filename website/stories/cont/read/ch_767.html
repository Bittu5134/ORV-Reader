<p class="orv_line">Soon, Yoo Jonghyuk came out of the smoke. His eyes were still focused on my colleagues.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cha Sungwoo, Cha Yerin, Lee Dansu, and Kyung Sein.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#x27;t tell which of them he was looking at.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Yoo Jonghyuk spoke clearly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He said, &#x27;He kept his promise.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">What on earth does that mean?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Could it be that one of them was one of the Ten Evils, or an equivalent villain, in Yoo Jonghyuk&#x27;s previous round?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If so.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Can we say that it was just a coincidence that I and the readers possessed &#x27;villain&#x27; characters?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk&#x27;s expression, who came out of the smoke, was strangely stiff.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone was opening the school gate and coming in.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「A slim body and a pitch-black cloak. A deeply pressed black hat and a black mask reminiscent of steampunk.」</div>「A slim body and a pitch-black cloak. A deeply pressed black hat and a black mask reminiscent of steampunk.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy slowly raised his head and was looking at us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt strange inside.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This year’s graduates are terrible.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy who was clearly in front of the school gate was behind me the next moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The speed is such that even Yoo Jonghyuk can&#x27;t react.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment when Yoo Jonghyuk, with his eyes wide open, reflexively tries to activate [Hundred Steps Godly Fists ].:</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah, you’re here!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Teacher Yang flapped her wings and flew up to the rooftop. Teacher Yang took turns introducing us and the boy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Guys, say hello. This is &#x27;Old School&#x27; from class 2, who came to help you with this graduation exam.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Old school?</p>
<p class="orv_line">That kid is a graduate of this school?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This friend’s name is—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Get your mind straight.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy shot back in a cold voice and glanced at us with murderous eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;When you go into that forest, it’s common to find yourself in a situation like just now. Next time I see you not be vigilant  again—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy glared at me with a cold gaze and warned me in a tone like Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then I will kill you myself.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">To be honest, when I first entered this worldview, I was optimistic about the situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is not a different worldview, but the worldview of the novel I serialized.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though the difficulty level of the worldview was the worst, I thought it was worth a try. Because I did not enter this world alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because there are readers and other characters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example,</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What? Get out.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yes, Kim Namwoon can do that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He&#x27;s not a really smart guy, so it wouldn&#x27;t be surprising if he didn&#x27;t recognize me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Namwoon, stop bullying the kids in inferior classes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Lee Jihye was there too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Namwoon. We are not a gang, but a student council.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What’s wrong with your outfit? What’s wrong with your tie?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a bit shocking to see that even Jung Heewon, the vice president of the student council, did not recognize me at all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first, I thought they couldn&#x27;t recognize me because my face had changed, but that didn&#x27;t seem to be the case.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Excuse me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, no. I guess I saw it wrong.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung seemed to recognize me a little, but then her face turned red and she ran away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was wondering if they were suffering from a status abnormality, so I tried using [Character List].</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Character list&#x27; cannot be used for this person.]</div>['Character list' cannot be used for this person.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Never before has such a message appeared to a &#x27;character&#x27;. It was even impossible for such a message to appear to a person who I had already used [Character List] on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That wasn&#x27;t the end of the strange messages.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Someone is viewing the &#x27;character information&#x27; of the person in question.]</div>[Someone is viewing the 'character information' of the person in question.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is there someone other than me who can use [Character List]?</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, rather, could [List of Characters] be written this way?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The information of the person being viewed by someone cannot be read.」</div>「The information of the person being viewed by someone cannot be read.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the main story, two characters with [Character List] never faced each other.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because Kim Dokja was a unique being.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But this time things were a little different. The reason was obvious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s Goo Senoah!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A voice came from one end of the hallway. As I watched the noisy students split up like waves, I realized who the &#x27;main character&#x27; chosen by this world view was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Student President Goo Seonah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Talented, excellent grades, outstanding in literature and martial arts. The protagonist of Class A, who possessed all the so-called &#x27;main character attributes&#x27;, was walking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment my eyes met hers, I understood the words of Dansu ahjussi and Kyung Sein.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「She looks like Kim Dokja.」</div>「She looks like Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like I finally knew what that meant. Indeed, her face subtly resembled mine.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story &#x27;Heir of the Eternal Name&#x27; growls.]</div>[Story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' growls.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Kim Dokja had a daughter or younger sister, would she have a face similar to mine?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Every time she approached, the students became agitated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#x27;m nervous. If this is really an &#x27;academy setting&#x27;, now is the time for something to happen.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「An incident where the excellent class A started a fight with the inferior class 2.」</div>「An incident where the excellent class A started a fight with the inferior class 2.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, as if to avoid such academic clichés, Goo Seonah quietly glared at me right in front of me and passed by.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, she left a strange comment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It won’t work out the way you think.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I reached out for her arm as she passed by.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know why you are against me, but I wanted to tell you that there is a misunderstanding. Now is not the time to fight among ourselves, and this is not a scenario to be wasted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s difficult.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">My hand was caught in Lee Hyunsung’s large grip.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An inexplicable feeling of disappointment suddenly rose up. But I didn&#x27;t know what to say. It was unclear whether this feeling I was feeling right now was appropriate.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that time, someone grabbed Lee Hyunsung by the collar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You idiot, are you sure that you don’t even recognize Kim Dokja?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Killer King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That guy is Kim Dokja. The same Kim Dokja you were protecting. But Lee Hyunsung, how dare you—!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;W-what are you doing?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung, who was embarrassed, was grabbed by Killer King and shook helplessly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kang Ilhoon-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only after hearing what I said did Killer King let go of the hand that was holding Lee Hyunsung&#x27;s collar. Lee Hyunsung looked at us with a puzzled expression and soon followed after Goo Seonah.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King muttered as he watched Lee Hyunsung&#x27;s back as he walked away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don’t you feel unfair?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They are your colleagues.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Colleague.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For some reason, the moment I heard those words, I felt like I was in a daze.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is there no way?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I heard from Yerin. It seems like this world was created by you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#x27;t answer anything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because I don&#x27;t have the &#x27;delusionist&#x27; attribute.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I understand that the &lt;Star Stream&gt; has a system that notifies the original author with a  citation when borrowing a world view.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I also had the same question as Killer King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this world was truly the 『Infinite Prison Guard』 that I know, I should have been notified before the scenario began.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asuka Ren, the copyright holder of &#x27;Peace Land&#x27;, also received a similar email from tIs123.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I didn&#x27;t receive any message.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why? Is it saying that it doesn&#x27;t  need to ask me for permission?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And who  is that guy again?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I raised my head at Killer King&#x27;s words, I saw the shadow of a boy glaring at me from a dark place on the stairs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t know either.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely the unidentified old school boy I saw the other day.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After that, the boy appeared near me every time and said the same thing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—If you don’t come to your senses, I will kill you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What&#x27;s certain is that he doesn&#x27;t seem like a person who would kill me.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">We continued cleaning at Teacher Yang&#x27;s request.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Class Z might not be able to participate in the graduation exam?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m still cleaning—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We collected and collected points. 200 points, 300 points, 400 points.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It would have been nice to receive another task with more points, but unfortunately, there were no tasks left.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There was a reason why Teacher Yang had us clean.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was because all other point assignments were completed in the &#x27;honors class&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s actually a good situation, you know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cha Yerin would know.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&#x27;Cleaning&#x27; was a task Ma Hyunsung performed every day until graduation.」</div>「'Cleaning' was a task Ma Hyunsung performed every day until graduation.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in the original work, the main character, Ma Hyunsung, performed a &#x27;cleaning task&#x27; every time. That was because he had the trait of [compulsive cleaning], but there was another purpose as well.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are currently carrying out &#x27;campus cleaning&#x27;.]</div>[You are currently carrying out 'campus cleaning'.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[While performing &#x27;school cleaning&#x27;, you may enter restricted areas of the school.]</div>[While performing 'school cleaning', you may enter restricted areas of the school.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Closed sports warehouse&#x27; in the annex.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Behind the teacher’s office&#x27; used for storing old teaching materials.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#x27;secret library&#x27; in the school library.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The advantage of the cleaning assignment is that you can access the &#x27;hidden places&#x27; of the school as a student.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The main character, Ma Hyunsung, performed this task every time and acquired hidden items, and the same was true for us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oooh! Dokja-ssi! Look at this!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first place where an item was discovered was the &#x27;Closed Sports Warehouse&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">SSS level item, &#x27;Ancient Insect Toshi&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was an upwardly compatible item with  the &#x27;Hermit’s Cloak&#x27; with its 「Camouflage」 story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’ll give this to you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A concealment item that can be used by manipulating insects and using the power of the King Chungjong, is suitable for use by Dansu ahjussi with low physical strength.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Next, there was an item found &#x27;behind the teacher’s office&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">SSS level item, &#x27;Tin Armor&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The tin armor was worn over CPR training material.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, I had no idea this was here. This is because this item is one that even &#x27;Ma Hyunsung&#x27;, the main character in the main story, could not obtain.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Evolution material for &#x27;Steel Lumberjack Armor&#x27;.」</div>「Evolution material for 'Steel Lumberjack Armor'.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">This item could later be upgraded to &#x27;Steel Lumberjack Armor&#x27;, one of the relics of the Master of Steel, by purchasing materials.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sein-ssi should use this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is that really okay?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s possible.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aaaah!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lastly, in the &#x27;Secret Library&#x27;, I found a half-glove with a small jewel embedded in it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Hyeoloksu&#x27; of Hyeolgwiin, a retired master of the first martial arts group.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Among the group, there are two people who are good at martial arts .</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, since Yoo Jonghyuk did not show much interest, the owner of the item naturally became Cha Yerin, who fights based on [Daejeon fighting].</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cha Yerin smiled faintly, as if she liked the newly acquired gloves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But Dokja-ssi, you didn’t get anything…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m fine.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The items I have obtained so far are sufficient.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only thing I lack right now is magical ability.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, I was making up for the lack of magical power by inhaling the &#x27;mana tobacco&#x27; that Yoo Jonghyuk had left on the rooftop after school.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I watched the group grow, I was reminded of Ma Hyunsung, the main character in 『Infinite Prison Guard』.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps Ma Hyunsung in the story felt the same way as me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&#x27;Infinite Prison Guard&#x27; is the story of the main character, Ma Hyunsung, gathering his colleagues to subdue the &#x27;Forest of Demons.&#x27;」</div>「'Infinite Prison Guard' is the story of the main character, Ma Hyunsung, gathering his colleagues to subdue the 'Forest of Demons.'」</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the story, Ma Hyunsung finds the special skills of the students in class 2, and strengthens their  power by matching items and equipment together. As a result, Class 2 sheds its stigma of being an inferior class and proudly participates in the &#x27;graduation exam&#x27; along with the honors class.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The graduation exam involves hunting the &#x27;target demon&#x27; in the &#x27;Forest of Demons&#x27;.」</div>「The graduation exam involves hunting the 'target demon' in the 'Forest of Demons'.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the story becomes somewhat worse from that point on.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「During the graduation exam, Ma Hyunsung loses his colleagues.」</div>「During the graduation exam, Ma Hyunsung loses his colleagues.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that fight, Ma Hyunsung loses all his companions, but after awakening, he succeeds in subduing the great demons.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And Ma Hyunsung witnesses the truth of this world at the end of the forest.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have reached the world ending.]</div>[You have reached the world ending.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">It turns out that this world he fought for, risking his life, was an elaborately created &#x27;virtual reality&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Do you want to &#x27;replay&#x27; the world?]</div>[Do you want to 'replay' the world?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">It turns out that Ma Hyunsung&#x27;s world was destroyed a long time ago, and he was the last surviving human being.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was reliving the same memory over and over again through his awakening ability, [Save].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although he knows that the ending of the save file is fixed, he forgets that fact and repeats the world being destroyed infinitely each time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thanks to you, the school is tidy. Good job, friends.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We looked at the cleaned campus with Teacher Yang.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ma Hyunsung, who pressed the &#x27;replay&#x27; button, must have cleaned this campus several times. Even though he knew that the campus would become dirty again, he would have continued to clean up the trash.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For those he remembers, for those who leave cigarettes on this campus and leave footprints.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Cleaning has to be done every day.&quot;」</div>「"Cleaning has to be done every day."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though he knew the identity of the world, Ma Hyunsung did not destroy the save file.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Rather, in order to remember this destruction, he repeats this world over and over again for an infinite amount of time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And is it really a coincidence that the &#x27;Recycling Center&#x27; chose this &#x27;Infinite Prison Guard&#x27; out of many </p>
<p class="orv_line">worldviews?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Teacher Yang spoke to us with a satisfied smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Now that you have reached all 500 points, there is now the final step.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is there anything else left?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, you need to get approval for the exam... Dokja, can you follow me for a moment? Only the principal can give approval for the graduation test.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded and followed after Teacher Yang.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you going to the principal’s office?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We walked down the cleaned hallway together. When we walked around looking at the playground we cleaned up together, we walked a little slowly. The school playground covered with bright green grass looked like a field of heaven.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Teacher.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Teacher Yang glanced behind me at my question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How did you become a teacher?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, it’s a secret.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you get paid a lot if you become a teacher?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Teacher Yang laughed lightly at my words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s unpaid.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes? Then why are you doing it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Teacher Yang, who was walking ahead, stopped. I stopped next to Teacher Yang.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Once you get to the principal’s office, the graduation exams will really start. Then you won’t be able to stop. I mean—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Teacher Yang continued speaking after a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You don’t have to graduate.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then I have to continue to be a student.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you are a student, your teacher can protect you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Teacher Yang&#x27;s eyes moved slowly. I also turned my head to follow her gaze.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s okay to make mistakes here. Even if you throw away trash or break the rules, you just have to get punished like cleaning the school grounds.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We looked out the window together. A lush forest stretched beyond the playground we cleaned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ma Hyunsung said.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The forest hides the truth.」</div>「The forest hides the truth.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Like Ma Hyunsung, I too will go beyond that forest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And maybe I&#x27;ll discover a truth I don&#x27;t want.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I have to graduate. That’s why I came to school.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You don’t have to.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If I don’t graduate.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw Teacher Yang.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Actually I know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why were we able to spend our time cleaning leisurely?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why was the &#x27;graduation exam&#x27;, which was supposed to start right away, delayed?</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this harsh worldview, why has &#x27;nothing happened&#x27; to us yet?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s hard to be a teacher.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The star who loved Kim Dokja more than anyone else in 『Omniscient Reader&#x27;s Viewpoint』.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The teacher&#x27;s eyes widened as if she was looking at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I left the teacher behind and started walking alone. A few steps away was the door to the teacher&#x27;s office.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Standing in front of the door, I slowly looked back at her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thank you, Uriel.&quot;</p>
