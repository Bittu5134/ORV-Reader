<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, just because I [incited] myself to be Kyrgios didn't mean I could freely use the real Kyrgios's skills. [Incite] is different from [Bookmark].</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">However, [Incite] had a more outstanding part than [Bookmark].</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 While 'Bookmark' borrows only one skill from the person in question, 'Incite' could really become the character itself depending on the use. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As long as I can fool everyone who sees me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Exclusive skill 'Incite' is affected by the attribute!]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of 'Kyrgios Roadgrim'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A small race born on the planet 'Peace Land'. The strongest of the &lt;First Murim&gt;, the Transcendental person who the stars fear.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The person who became too strong to save his hometown...</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">With a tingling feeling, the image of Kyrgios in my head became blurry.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The amount of text I had was absurdly insufficient to become 'Kyrgios Rodgraim' with this alone.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, I had good materials to stretch my imagination.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Exclusive skill 'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World' is activated!]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Skill synergy occurs!]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The effect of 'Incite' is rapidly increasing!]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The sentences of 'Ways of Survival' began to flow into my head. Kyrgios’s habits, hobbies, and things that he didn't even know were left as text. The expression he makes when he's angry. The gaze when looking at his disciples. The look in his eyes when he trains martial arts seriously. The smile he makes when he climbs high and plays the viola alone.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Kyrgios Rodgraim. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Everything written about Kyrgios was reproduced in my head, and the Kyrgios I understood was expressed again in my physical body.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Kyrgios silently drew his sword. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Unfortunately, what I did not have was his exclusive equipment, the Pure White Sword.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Thoughts about almost everything mimicked the 'stick of Samyongdan'.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">But for now, this was enough.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 On the day when all the masters of the Murim were brought to their knees, the weapon Kyrgios was holding was a wooden sword for practice. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The dragon head ark saw me, and I also saw the ark.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">We lunged at each other almost simultaneously.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kagagagak!</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Two weapons colliding in the air.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Holding the old shotgun barrel, the Dragon Head Ark tilted its head and asked.</p>

<p class="orv_line">"You have a strange holy relic. Which star used to use the bamboo stick?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It is a Korean constellation called 'The Bald General of Justice'."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's a bit of a modifier, but the relic is excellent."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' shrugs.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' wipes his head.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Now, show me Kyrgios’s skills."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The baton of the ark moved.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Even though he didn't use his inner power at all, the batting stick wielded by the ark overflowed with sensible energy.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">2nd baton method.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Dangdu Bongal.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The ark's exclusive unofficial baton method. Originally, the first batting stick, as the name suggests, was made to catch wild dogs.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The beggars' nemesis was the dogs that fetched the discarded rice, and the beggars made a martial art to efficiently hit wild dogs to protect their rice bowls. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Spot!</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I twisted my body wide and avoided the batting stick falling on my head.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's quite good, but it's still clumsy."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The eyes of the ark wielding the batting stick were shining brightly. I was struck by those eyes with a wry smile that said that he would thoroughly tear down and evaluate each and every one of my movements.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The power of [Incite] spread throughout my body, and a clear sentence came to mind.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Kyrgios's disciple starts training by sleeping on a bracelet at the same time as initiation, and learns introductory swordsmanship from the second year of wearing it correctly. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In 'Omniscient Reader', Kyrgios's martial arts rarely appear. The only ones that appear are [Baekcheongganggi] and [Jeoninhwa]. It was because the others were meaningless to him, who had already risen to the ranks of the transcendental throne.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">However, before transcending, Kyrgios also used numerous martial arts.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Introductory Swordsmanship, White Blue Swordsmanship. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I took a deep breath and sighed.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Just pointing to a point in the universe. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">1st white-blue sword method.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">One point.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">At first glance, it was a simple stab. However, those who know the absurdity of this stabbing will never say that it is 'a simple stab'.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">This is because Kyrgios’s disciples repeat the same training for thousands of days for this one stab.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Only, to acquire a single sense.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "It should literally feel like you're making a dot." 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Marking a single dot in the vast universe.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "That way, the opponent will be able to appreciate the true value of this skill." 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">My level 40 strength was condensed and I let out a scream.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">One point is the beginning and end.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">On top of that paradox, Kyrgios’s question about the universe begins.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Little by little, a different color appeared in the eyes of the ark that greeted the point.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's clumsy, but it's definitely Kyrgios’s swordsmanship."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As if the ark had waited, the shotgun barrel rotated. Even though he didn't use his inner energy, the shadow of the shotgun rose like a cloud.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Clouds of countless rising shadows buried a weak point of light.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Truly the pinnacle of the batting stick method.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">But the stars didn't seem to think so.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' laughs.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'The Two-Legged Expert' yawns at the boring confrontation.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I know.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In the eyes of the constellations, our fight will be nothing more than a trivial clowning game.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">For the super-strong who have mastered the subtleties of form, herbivory is nothing more than a standardized calculation method.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, the Dragon Head Ark was sincere.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">He swung the batting stick with all his might, as if this insignificant fight was the life-and-death decision of a lifetime.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">6 seconds of the baton method.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Foot structure.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A batting stick that ends up on the floor and is pushed up towards the sky.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I knew it the moment I saw this movement.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Whether it's a dog, a porcupine, or a groll, the representative of another station. Any creature hit by his baton would have died.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Then, as if performing a trick, the ark hit the fragments on the floor that floated in the air.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">He hit it with a stick and sent it flying.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Sieeeeek!</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Fragments of the broken floor shot at me like sharp arrows.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">4th white-blue sword method.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Blue wheel.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Hold the sword positively. A technique that gently rotates a wheel to heat space.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Kyrgios’s defensive move to defend against flying arrows.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Several fragments that could not be fully blocked quickly grazed my forearms and thighs.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"That's funny. Kyrgios’s martial arts weren't like this at all."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">However, contrary to what he said, a small smile was forming from the corner of the Ark's mouth.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'The First Sword of Goryeo' makes an interested expression.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Maritime Admiral' feels an unknown charm in your battle.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations in the sky were watching our fight.</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' picks his nose, asking why they are so eager for such a trivial fight.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'King of the Evil Stage' snorts.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, not everyone was in favor of this confrontation.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">But there were definitely people watching this messy fight.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is cheering for your fight.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is watching you.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I realize that there are many stars in this world all over again. Perhaps there is no story that can satisfy them all.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">But in the first place, this story was not for them.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation that has not yet revealed their modifier is watching your story.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Where do you take it!"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The bamboo stick and the dragon constantly collided. I was pushed back without even taking a deep breath at the series of consecutive attacks that flowed like water.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Walking is literally a way of walking. Keep in mind where you will and will not set foot. At one step that you think is nothing, someone dies and someone lives." 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">In the midst of the sentences of 'Ways of Survival' that rushed in, I couldn't even tell if they were the words of Kyrgios or the words of the white and blue master who was older than Kyrgios.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "The important thing is to know the weight of your steps. The lightest can be the most mirrorless. That is the paradox of lightness spoken of in Baekcheong." 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Only I heard the steps and walked.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It's really strange. It's unlikely that it's the footsteps of an educated person."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A sloppy, incoherent backward step. But even with that step, I evaded the baton of the ark.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I swung the bamboo stick as best as I could. It wasn't important to move well.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Just as every sentence contains context, the movements are just a vessel that holds meaning to Murin.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">For example, it is like a finger pointing at the moon.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Ark said, narrowing his eyes.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"It is a skill that you cannot use today. You are-"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Most of my beginnings were full of failures. That should be the case at the current level of [ Incite] now.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">There was no way it could be reproduced at the same level as Kyrgios.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The Kyrgios I read was perfect, but my physical abilities were infinitely poor.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">But now, the gap has actually reduced.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Why—"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Now the ark was watching. The one man on the other side that my stick pointed to.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"No. He was faster than that. It was heavier and more terrifying."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The ark, repeating his monologue, brandished a batting ball at me as if possessed.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Every time my bamboo stick collided with his baton, it seemed like there was a knocking sound from somewhere. The landscape of the world changed along the trajectory of the weapon that cut through the air.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[「The man he wanted to fight for a long time was beyond that.」]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The Ark swung his baton again and again like a man trying to follow that fantasy.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Despite the dizzying pain that pierced my shin and torso, I gritted my teeth and accepted his attacks.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to protect his fantasy.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The expression on the ark's face was filled with joy.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">If someone had seen it, it would have been a terrible performance. There is no place to run away to, so there is no place to run, and there are times when I stumble and hit the floor with a weapon.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">However, the scene of rain unfolding in the head of the ark right now is a bit different from that.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It would have been different.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'The First Sword of Goryeo' opens his mouth blankly.]</p></div>

<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' asks what the hell is everyone looking at.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The utterly bewildered Ark murmured like a madman.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"Were you there, Kyrgios?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Then Kyrgios's dot split the sky. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The fight that ends is an illusion built up with lies.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The batting stick of the ark against him hit the ground. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>

<hr>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Murim in the Dragon's Head Ark has already disappeared from this world. 」</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Nonetheless, some stars who lived uninhabited for a time recalled their own landscapes that they remembered from our fight.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel their emotions in the shimmering starlight.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">They were envious.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">They were truly envious of the Dragon Head Ark who was allowed to drop everything and go down to earth to experience this story himself.</p>

<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The last herb of the ark unfolded, and I, too, squeezed all my strength as if I swung a sword.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The batting stick of the Ark broke with a loud sound. At the same time, my mimicry was also lifted.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">We looked at each other with bated breath.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was hard to breathe because I didn't use magic at all. [Incite] was released, and the recoil of my body pushed me away.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Incite' is canceled.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">The Ark was staggering and watching me. His dreamy eyes returned.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">As the scenery of Murim was cleared, the truth of the story was fully revealed. There was no Kyrgios who had suffocated him. I made him dream again.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">"You're not a disciple of Kyrgios."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">A sweet story written only for him. The star that woke up from that terrible dream was crying like a child.</p>
