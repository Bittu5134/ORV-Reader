<p class="orv_line">I once shared such a joke with Ji Eunyoo. I asked her if we would survive if we were to fall into</p>
<p class="orv_line">the first scenario of Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyoo answered me like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">ㅡHonestly, I&#x27;m not confident, but what about you, author-nim?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What did I say? I don&#x27;t remember.</p>

<p class="orv_line">This was such an extraordinary situation that I couldn&#x27;t help but use the punctuation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I touched my face in the reflection of the screen door several times. It wasn&#x27;t because I was</p>
<p class="orv_line">handsome. It wasn&#x27;t that there was something weird on the screen door.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My face had literally changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What the.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Crooked smiling eyes, thin lips with a subtle hint of meanness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized where I&#x27;d seen this face before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sure enough, there was a life-size figure standing at the entrance to the theater with the same</p>
<p class="orv_line">face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I couldn&#x27;t remember who he was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was he an undescribed extra?</p>

<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m not the only one seeing this, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There&#x27;s something here. Hey, can you feel it? There&#x27;s something like a wall here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A certain radius of the station was surrounded by a transparent wall. It was a wall I knew well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The scenario device that makes it impossible to get out until certain conditions are met.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, where are the subway employees? Aren&#x27;t they making announcements?&quot;</p>

<p class="orv_line">Why me? Did I earn someone&#x27;s grudge? Did one of the characters put me in here?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Han Sooyoung from the event theater was real?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then was it Han Sooyoung?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It could be. Han Sooyoung, who didn&#x27;t want me to pretend to be Omniscient Reader&#x27;s author, had</p>
<p class="orv_line">put me here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It could also be Yoo Joonghyuk. The way I described all the misery he went through was enough</p>
<p class="orv_line">to make him hold a grudge against me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it was Kim Dokja. Maybe it was Kim Dokja, who wanted to take revenge on me for</p>
<p class="orv_line">revealing the protagonist&#x27;s secret tastes to the entire universe. Or maybe he did it for no reason at</p>
<p class="orv_line">all, he just has a bad personality.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shit, I don&#x27;t know. There&#x27;s no point in thinking about it now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pushed the uncertainty out of my head, leaving only the certainty.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One, I was in an &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Two, I&#x27;m possessing someone else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Three, the scenarios were about to begin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly scanned my surroundings. If the first scenario is about to begin, I need to figure out</p>
<p class="orv_line">what I can use to my advantage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">First, I&#x27;m in a subway station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The station is from the orange line, so it&#x27;s line 3, and the station name is.......</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Geumho. 」</div>「Geumho. 」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly frowned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In my head, I recalled some information about Geumho Station. It was the first base of the main</p>
<p class="orv_line">character, Kim Dokja, and the place where the massacre took place.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, that was in the second half of the first volume, and fortunately, I hadn&#x27;t gotten to that</p>
<p class="orv_line">point yet...... In a sense, it could have been more dangerous now.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Ah, aah. ^&amp;@@#%.]</div>[Ah, aah. ^&@@#%.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like I was being dragged down into the cold depths by my ankles.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I never thought the day would come when I&#x27;d be able to see a Dokkaebi with my own eyes. Two</p>
<p class="orv_line">little horns. A creature with fluffy fur wearing a small straw mat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remember. He had this kind of role at first.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Can you hear me?]</div>[Can you hear me?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja&#x27;s streaming contract partner, the Dokkaebi Bihyung.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Uh-oh, at least it&#x27;s quieter here than on other places, huh.......]</div>[Uh-oh, at least it's quieter here than on other places, huh.......]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung looked back at the moment and our eyes met. I lowered my head in surprise. It&#x27;s only in</p>
<p class="orv_line">the second half of the story that Bihyung becomes sympathetic to Kim Dokja, while the earlier</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung is a crazy monster who breaks the heads of incarnations for fun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, I didn&#x27;t see any humans getting their heads cracked off while arguing with Bihyung</p>
<p class="orv_line">like in the main story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Especially that big guy over there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Okay, I&#x27;m going to explain what&#x27;s going on, so listen up.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew full well what Bihyung was going to say next. I&#x27;ve written dozens of manuscripts where</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#x27;ve seen that line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He&#x27;s probably running a similar script simultaneously in the scenario area he controls.</p>
<p class="orv_line">eating, shitting, and reproducing at will without paying anything in return! Ha! What a world</p>
<p class="orv_line">you&#x27;ve been living in!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I listened to him, I wondered if this is what it would have been like if a &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27;s</p>
<p class="orv_line">movie had come out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is that I&#x27;m now an extra in that movie.</p>
<p class="orv_line">watched over your planet with great generosity, but that&#x27;s only until today, and the time has come</p>
<p class="orv_line">for you to repay them for all the kindness they&#x27;ve shown you. It&#x27;s better for you to see what&#x27;s</p>
<p class="orv_line">going on than to hear me ramble on about it, right?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if he couldn&#x27;t be bothered to recite the boring lines, Bihyung snapped his fingers.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[#BI-7623 channel opened.]</div>[#BI-7623 channel opened.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellations have entered.]</div>[Constellations have entered.]</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">A small window floated upwards above those who raised their heads in confusion.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The main scenario has arrived!]</div>[The main scenario has arrived!]</p>
<div class="orv_window">

<p class="orv_line">The Dokkaebi&#x27;s transparent body slowly faded away, giving us a vague smile.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Then, good luck everyone. Please show me an interesting story.]</div>[Then, good luck everyone. Please show me an interesting story.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the scenario window popped up in front of me, it really hit home.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The time limit reducing in real time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Right now it says 30 minutes, but as the time goes on, the penalties will start to kick in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What does this mean?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unsure of what&#x27;s going on, people started talking to each other and calling out to each other. In</p>
<p class="orv_line">the distance, I could see people scratching and hitting the transparent wall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took a light, deep breath and muttered to myself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Attribute Window.&#x27;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently, due to a system error, the Attribute Window cannot be activated.]</div>[Currently, due to a system error, the Attribute Window cannot be activated.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I squinted my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This wasn&#x27;t working?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Fourth Wall.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I called it out, just in case.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja had the [Fourth Wall] skill since the beginning, and as a penalty of that skill, he was</p>
<p class="orv_line">restricted from viewing the Attribute Window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So, if I also have the [Fourth Wall.]......</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Fourth Wall.&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So why doesn&#x27;t it open?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s a novel I wrote, dammit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">First of all, I&#x27;m a writer, not a reader, so I should have the [Writer]&#x27;s skills... Maybe I have</p>
<p class="orv_line">I concentrated and tried to use [Avatar] and other writer-only skills. But there was no noticeable</p>
<p class="orv_line">change, except for the strain on my sphincter.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The remaining time has decreased.]</div>[The remaining time has decreased.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There are 28 minutes remaining.]</div>[There are 28 minutes remaining.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">While I struggled in vain, the crowd in the station split into two groups.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One was a group of people wearing sweatshirts with the same logo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Everyone, please don&#x27;t panic and gather this way!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s go to the deacon&#x27;s side!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were clutching tissues with the church&#x27;s name on them; they seemed to be from the same</p>
<p class="orv_line">church.</p>
<p class="orv_line">On the other side of the room, a large man with a tattoo on his forearm was gathering people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey, everybody, come over here and help!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was the same guy who was worried about getting his head cracked by Bihyung earlier. The</p>
<p class="orv_line">big guy pushed against the transparent wall with both hands and shouted at the other people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Everyone push this together! We might be able to get out!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Obviously, it&#x27;s safer to struggle against a wall than to attack a Dokkaebi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But some people didn&#x27;t think so.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What if we do something weird and that monster does something to us?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then what? If you&#x27;re not going to help, go away. Push! Harder! Harder!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this point, some of the other people who had been hesitating joined in and started pushing</p>
<p class="orv_line">against the wall. The sound of cha, cha, cha, cha echoed around the room, and the people in the</p>
<p class="orv_line">church who had been watching got involved.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Everyone, let&#x27;s help him!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the deacon&#x27;s signal, the congregation rushed in and pushed against the wall. It was quite a</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">sight to see, dozens of people clinging to the transparent wall like a pantomime.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly made my way to the edge of the station as people struggled with the wall. A few steps</p>
<p class="orv_line">away, I caught my reflection in the screen door.</p>
<p class="orv_line">First, I think I&#x27;m possessing a bad character.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A body whose average stats does not seem to exceed 1.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is why I wasn&#x27;t sure I could win a fight against a bare-chested Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I have to meet him somehow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know what caused me to be possess this man, but considering what&#x27;s normal in web</p>
<p class="orv_line">novels, I should be able to return to reality the moment I see the end of the scenarios.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So I needed to meet the main character of &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27;, who dies and comes back to life</p>
<p class="orv_line">for the sake of his colleagues, and win his favor. It&#x27;s the only way to increase your chances of</p>
<p class="orv_line">survival in this cruel world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, I&#x27;ll have to survive here before you can meet Kim Dokja or anyone else.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The first scenario requires you to kill &#x27;one or more living things&#x27;.」</div>「The first scenario requires you to kill 'one or more living things'.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja cleared the first scenario by crushing the grasshoppers and grasshopper eggs</p>
<p class="orv_line">collected by Lee Gilyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But since he&#x27;s the main character, he&#x27;s lucky, and since I&#x27;m an extra character, I&#x27;m not so lucky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As an extra character, I can&#x27;t be that lucky.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「So this is what I came up with.」</div>「So this is what I came up with.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glared at the soda machine in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you didn&#x27;t end up in the same train car as Kim Dokja, you&#x27;d be lucky to land in a subway</p>
<p class="orv_line">station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At least here, this vending machine was my &#x27;insect catcher&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Push! Harder!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aaaahhh.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I gently shook the vending machine in time with the chants of the wall pushers.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「A lot of bugs live in subway vending machines with refrigeration and freezers.」</div>「A lot of bugs live in subway vending machines with refrigeration and freezers.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had seen an article like that when I wrote about 200 chapters for Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder how many times I shook it like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something made a thud sound, and a nameless bug crawled out from under the vending machine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly clasped my hands together and trapped the fleeing bug.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lucky for me, I&#x27;ll survived the first scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately tried to crush the bug in my hand.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">「Maybe it&#x27;s a pregnant bug.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">My hesitation wasn&#x27;t because I was philosophizing about the bug&#x27;s right to life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hesitated because I remembered a line from &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「An &#x27;egg&#x27; is a living thing.」</div>「An 'egg' is a living thing.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the scenario, bugs&#x27; eggs are recognized as living beings, and Kim Dokja&#x27;s solution was to</p>
<p class="orv_line">crack hundreds of eggs to gain an advantage in the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what would have happened if Kim Dokja had given the bug&#x27;s eggs to everyone on the</p>
<p class="orv_line">subway?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced over and saw people banging on the transparent wall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">People knocking on the wall to live.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew who the people in Geumho Station were. People who could casually take the lives of</p>
<p class="orv_line">others for their own survival.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I felt like Kim Dokja.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「What would Kim Dokja do if he returned to the first scenario?」</div>「What would Kim Dokja do if he returned to the first scenario?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, a tsuchuchut rang out and I almost missed the bug.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#x27;t a probability spark.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The cell phone in my pocket was ringing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hesitated for a moment, then slipped the bug in my fist into my coat pocket and zipped it up</p>
<p class="orv_line">tight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my phone and a message popped up.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have one new message.]</div>[You have one new message.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">A message?</p>
<p class="orv_line">ㅡSender: RepresentativeKimDokja</p>

<p class="orv_line">I looked at the message with suspicion in my eyes.</p>
