            <div class="orv_title"><h1>755 Episode 32 Monkey King (2)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">There are a total of four 'Sun Wukong' in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Sun Wukong' is divided into a total of four depending on the modifier he has.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first one was 'Meihouwang' who was the monkey king of Mt. Hwagwa Mountain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The second is 'Bimawen', who was the stable keeper of the heavenly world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The third is 'Great Sage Heaven's Equal', whom we know (this guy is the owner of the golden headband).</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fourth is 'Douzhanshengfo', who attained enlightenment at the end of his journey and became Buddha.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at it this way, I felt that he was somehow similar to Kim Dokja. Because Kim Dokja’s existence was divided according to his modifier.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I asked, are you Kim Dokja?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"First of all, I am Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued speaking while looking closely at the monkey in front of me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Dazzling golden fur. Tattered tiger skin panties. Even his unique eyes that look somewhat drowsy. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely true. The monkey in front of me is—</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you Meihouwang?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This guy. It's quite surprising that you recognize me.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Meihouwang snorted, placed his hands on his waist and looked triumphant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, Meihouwang is a narrative-grade constellation that represents the birth of 'Sun Wukong'. According to Kim Dokja, it was the constellation equivalent of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However… What is this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The impact felt by Meihouwang was not large. At first, I thought it was because I was getting stronger, but I didn't think that was the case.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is he hiding his true power?</p>
<p class="orv_line">That may be so. Because all Sun Wukongs are good at adjusting the level of the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But even so, is it possible for Meihouwang, a narrative-grade constellation, to appear here in an incarnation body?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since everything that happens these days completely ignores probability, I now doubt whether probability even exists in this world.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Is that how you see it?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I guess I was staring too hard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">King Mifu said while scratching his golden hair.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Is this guy also in love with my fur? Well, even the Great Sage guy is jealous of my fur. He is a man with eyes to see.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When he says Great Sage, he probably means Great Sage Heaven’s Equal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Meihouwang chuckled and said with his deep eyes flashing.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You probably know why I came.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I can guess."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just a few hours ago, I received a message from the 'Monkey' faction saying they were recruiting me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the Meihouwang before my eyes was the famous 'Monkey King'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The faction 'Monkey God' invites you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, Meihouwang is the master of the 'Monkey God' faction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's not another monkey, it's Meihouwang.. The scale of the 'Zodiac Ball' might be bigger than I thought.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Hmm. Even though I came in person, the response was only that much?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When I saw Meihouwang’s disapproving expression, I thought it was a pity. I should have asked to take a picture together.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Insolent bastard, come join my forces.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Meihouwang, like Sun Wukong, didn't even listen to my answer and just kept talking.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I liked your story. I allow you to become my incarnation.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">To be honest, it would be a lie if I said there wasn't a part that tempted me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is the incarnation body of Meihouwang.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I wasn't the incarnation of the 'Demon King of Salvation', I might have been quite attracted to it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I can persuade Meihouwang to succeed in the '4-stage union of Sun Wukong' and then evolve him into 'The AncientLiberator', I will have the strongest mythical constellation in history as my sponsor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, it was a wrong assumption at this point.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m sorry, but I already have a constellation—"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Hmph, I already know that your idiot sponsor is away. Are you ignoring me?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Even if he is away, once you are behind someone , you are always behind them."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't even in my mind, but Kim Dokja would have said this. As expected, Meihouwang’s reaction was not bad.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This guy is more loyal than I thought. I like it.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you for your understanding."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[If that’s the case, I will directly order 'cancellation of the constellation contract'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It occurred to me later that I had made a mistake. Meihouwang is Sun Wukong, who has the most eccentric personality among his brothers. He was a 'King of Monkeys' who did whatever he wanted to do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as I was wondering what kind of incredible lie I had to tell to avoid this situation—</p>
<p class="orv_line">A skein of shining golden thread flew from somewhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The skein of thread wrapped exactly around Meihouwang’s head. The sound of an order was heard afterwards. Meihouwang, who was holding his head, let out an undignified scream.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Ngegegegegegegegye—]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Monkey Seal' begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It's a story about overpowering 'Meihouwang'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Okay! I knew!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With a 'pop' sound, Meihouwang turned into a small monkey. Meihouwang, who was glaring at me disapprovingly, did a somersault, jumped backwards sharply, and climbed on top of a woman.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The woman smiled bitterly at Meihouwang, who shouted "Ukkkkkkk."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I told you not to do that, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A unique, clear voice that reassures people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I often thought,</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Yoo Sangah existed in reality, she might have been that person.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Another person in this world who calls me 'writer'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Have you written any side stories in the meantime, author?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Editor Ji Eunyu was there.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu and I parted ways during the fierce battle at the Washington Dome. At that time, she had neither the time nor the presence of mind to say hello.</p>
<p class="orv_line">On one side, the Demon King of Salvation was dying, and on the other side, Yoo Jonghyuk, who had become a black beast, was running rampant.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Meihouwang' looks at you with disapproving eyes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, there was only one monkey running wild right now, and even that monkey had calmed down in Ji Eunyu's arms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps it was because she had subdued Meihouwang, but it seemed as if a halo could be seen behind Ji Eunyu's back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Your spirit has turned white."</p>
<p class="orv_line">" author, it looks like you’re having a hard time."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is it noticeable even though I’m wearing a mask?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, I can see it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">We exchanged casual greetings and smiled at each other.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is a unique feeling of relief when I am with Ji Eunyu. I feel like it's okay even if I make mistakes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My editor not only finds spelling and spacing, but also finds sentences I forgot to write.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She could tell whether I was confident in my writing by reading just a few sentences of the manuscript.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s noticeable."</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's what Ji Eunyu said when I asked her how she knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Editor. I have a lot to ask. Especially…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu noticed my sidelong glance at Meihouwang and cleared her throat slightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Have you forgotten who my sponsor is?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A bit late, a series of information came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As far as I know, the constellation that Ji Eunyu signed a contract with was 'Lotus Flower Blooming Under the Moonlight'— 'Yoo Sangah, the Emperor of Wolha', a member of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I chose 'Monkey' among the zodiac signs. I thought that would be the easiest to conquer."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the story, Yoo Sangah goes through the 'Island of the Reincarnated' and is resurrected through the incarnation of Tang Sanzang(?).</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, most of the 'Yeonhwadae' and related skills used by Yoo Sangah are borrowed from Sanzang’s tale.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The metaphor is a judgment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If I go to the 'Monkey' faction, I can use my sponsor’s story."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was secretly impressed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But the monkey force could have been without Sun Wukong."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This is the 'Recycling Center'. I thought Sun Wukong would definitely be there. Instead, it’s the somewhat unpopular Sun Wukong."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Indeed, the power of reasoning to find even unwritten sentences.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Meihouwang' is complaining that he is ignored again!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu gently scratched Meihouwang’s chin and continued her words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"And when I got to the monkey area, there was this big cave. I was immediately convinced."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huagua Mountain Convergence Cave."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, there was this person there."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who would have guessed that the 'monkey area' of the Chinese zodiac was the birthplace of Meihouwang?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was undoubtedly an excellent place for </p>
<p class="orv_line">'recycling'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">" author, you didn’t choose any faction, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I knew you would. Because you’re the type of person who only takes the hardest path."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It really wasn’t easy this time."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Still, you definitely feel different than before. Your back seems to have straightened a bit."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at my body again. Now that I think about it, I feel like my body has improved a little.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I understand that you went around having fun without writing what you were told to write."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although I heard some nagging, meeting Ji Eunyu here was a blessing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From the looks of it, Meihouwang doesn't seem to have any particular hostility towards us.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Level 2 of the exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that I suddenly heard a skill activation message.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint has never been activated in this way, so maybe it's the influence of the 'Constellation Act'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I could hear someone's inner thoughts in my head.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Who is it. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately knew whose thoughts those were. This person doesn't use question marks even when thinking.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 She called him writer. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"By the way, I’m late for the introduction. Editor, this is Cha Yerin. Yerin, this is my editor."</p>
<p class="orv_line">But this time, I heard the other side’s inner thoughts.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Writer, is it okay to say that? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There were a little too many 'inner feelings'.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Did he reveal that he was a writer? 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Then it’ll be a little bit difficult, right? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yes. therefore.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 If it’s someone he can trust, it’ll be okay. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 But Kim Dokja didn’t reveal his identity until much later. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Let me explain.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 What if that person betrays us? 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I think we need to come up with a separate response plan. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 As a first measure— 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly intervened before Ji Eunyu’s plan of action could progress any further.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Editor, this person is my reader. You can rest assured."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I revealed my secret. She is my only reader."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The only… reader?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I happened to express it that way, but it wasn't wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cha Yerin is probably the only person who read and remembers my debut work.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Then what about me? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Eh?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Nice to meet you. I’m Ji Eunyu. I’m the person who reads and edits the author’s writing before anyone else."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did I suddenly come to my senses.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, Cha Yerin wasn't the only one. Although she may not have read my debut novel, Ji Eunyu was a reader who read my novels before anyone else and read them more.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m Cha Yerin. I’ve read all of his novels."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu's expression changed completely after hearing Cha Yerin's introduction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You’ve read all of the author’s novels?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even the Genesis trilogy?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You’re a complete Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cha Yerin awkwardly looked down at her toes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now I understand. That's an embarrassing expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What path did you take when reading the book?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I read it in paperback first, but I bought it all later. The serial version, the copy, and—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wow! Thank you so much! What are you doing, writer? You need to thank her quickly."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly said thanks to her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Bigger! She’s the one who saved our management from almost being ruined!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you need an autographed copy, please let me know anytime! I don’t have the book right now, but—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I thought about it, this was Ji Eunyu’s true self. I was worried for no reason.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Meihouwang' yawns, saying he doesn’t know what you are talking about.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Meihouwang' urges you to proceed with the scenario quickly.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Look at that. Come to think of it, this wasn’t the time."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, well. Let’s leave our greetings like this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you know where this place is?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In response to Ji Eunyu’s question, I looked around at the surrounding scenery.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A landscape covered in clouds everywhere.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 This is the place where Kim Dokja waited for the carriage during the 'Constellation Banquet'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The name of this place is 'Cloud Road'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A place that serves as a tributary and station connecting the scenarios of the &lt;Star Stream&gt;. That means,</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The carriage will be here soon."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if to prove my thoughts, I saw something like a small dot flying from afar in the sky. The dot grew bigger little by little, and as expected, it took on the shape of a carriage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cha Yerin said with admiration.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A carriage like that came during the constellation banquet."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that time, it was Apollo's golden chariot.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The carriage coming this time was also a luxurious golden carriage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The difference was that this time it was the little rats that were pulling the carriage.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Meihouwang' is complaining that the organizers have used their coins in the wrong place again.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A golden carriage at the 'Recycling Center'. Perhaps in which scenario was that used first?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[New sub-scenario has arrived!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Sub Scenario - Orient Express Wagon&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Sub</p>
<p>Difficulty: S++</p>
<p>Clear conditions: Get on the carriage. Arrive at your destination safely.</p>
<p>Time limit: 2 hours</p>
<p>Reward: 'Zodiac Ball' admission ticket.</p>
<p>Failure: Death.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">On the outside, it was such a peaceful scenario that one wondered if this could even be a scenario. But.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is this it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That’s it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I answered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As any aspiring Killer King knows, the carriage Kim Dokja is riding in in the 'Constellations' Banquet' is attacked by constellations and crashes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The mere fact that 'riding on a carriage' came up as a scenario means that this carriage will inevitably suffer the same fate.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Above all, the meaningful sentence 'arrive at your destination safely' proved this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled bitterly and opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There is no way to get over this easily."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who can I blame?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I told you when I was serializing. Sometimes you need an easy scenario so readers can take a break."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't know it would come back to me like this either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I was wrong."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even the difficulty level of the sub-scenario is S++.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this point, I suspect that the 'Recycling Center’s Director' may also be a possessed person.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A carriage that strangely resembled Apollo's golden carriage finally stopped in front of me. The squeaking rats lowered their heads as if to say hello.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I put my hand on the carriage door handle to board, a message came out.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Only designated incarnations can ride this carriage.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story fragment 'Facial Recognition' is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It’s a carriage with a 'face recognition' function.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was it by any chance made in &lt;Emperor&gt;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyu and Cha Yerin, who completed facial recognition, boarded in turn, followed by my turn.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Face recognition failed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it was broken, but when I thought about it, I was still wearing the mask. It's not even a metaphorical object for the carriage, so no one would recognize me wearing a mask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that the Zone 13 scenario was over, there was no reason to insist on masking any longer.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Release the 'mask'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As I took off my mask for the first time in a while, the stuffy feeling disappeared and cool air enveloped my face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I relaxed my neck for a moment and lightly rolled my shoulders, but my face felt strangely hot.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I looked up, Ji Eunyu and Cha Yerin were looking at me with surprised eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation Meihouwang is looking at you blankly.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The same was true for Meihouwang, who was sitting on Ji Eunyu’s head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What followed was Meihouwang’s voice heard in my ears.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This guy. That’s interesting.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My face was reflected in the carriage window that slowly opened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at this face for a long time, even forgetting that I had to get on the carriage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The person I possessed was clearly Cheon Inho. However,</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' smiles with satisfaction as he looks at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Reflected in the window, I was wearing Kim Dokja’s face.</p>
