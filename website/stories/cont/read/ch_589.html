            <div class="orv_title"><h1>589 Episode 7. Trauma (2)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't believe it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't believe that's really the 'Cheon Inho' I know.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "If you won't end it." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho's figure, that was standing on a blood tomb, disappeared.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I will." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Wings of pitch black feathers spread from his back. And the next moment.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'When All the Stars Close Their Eyes' has begun its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt goosebumps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Cheon Inho' used a story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What on earth had happened, what had he eaten to grow up this much, to make him so strong at the 40th turn?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kookookookookoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk, who grabbed the Splitting the Sky Sword, looked around. But there was no sign of Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was only pitch blackness around him. No starlight could illuminate Cheon Inho's figure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no sign of him, no smell.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 It was as if Yoo Joonghyuk was alone. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, something invisible slashed Yoo Joonghyuk's cheek, then his forearm, then his thigh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Blood spurted everywhere, as if he was playing with him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk didn't fight back, but waited, holding the Splitting the Sky Sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I watched the battle with sweaty hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Neither his five senses nor my vision could detect the figure of Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Yoo Joonghyuk's growing wounds spoke for themselves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho is here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk used the [Red Phoenix Shunpo] to start his movements. Cheon Inho's attacks became faster. The number of wounds quickly increased.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shoulders, thighs, neck, calves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there were no fatal wounds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Every time a blow touched his skin, Yoo Joonghyuk was controlling the depth of the wound with an amazing technique. It was almost a miracle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Very slowly, Yoo Joonghyuk's lips opened.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Open your eyes." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And then,</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'The King Who Leads the Stars' has begun its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The unbelievable happened.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Open your eyes, damn constellations." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With Yoo Joonghyuk's words, the stars in the far reaches of the night sky began to shine. The world's few remaining stars were burning themselves to create light.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' is looking at the incarnation of Yoo Joonghyuk.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking at the incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Guardian of Youths and Travel' is looking at the incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Gabriel, Uriel and Raphael, the stars of &lt;Eden&gt; were shining.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But their light was not enough to dispel the darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, Yoo Joonghyuk said.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "It's enough." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, the uniform darkness shook in disparate ways, and an aggressive energy boiled through Yoo Joonghyuk's entire body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The slash on his side and the movement of his Splitting the Sky Sword happened at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship (破天劍道).</p>
<p class="orv_line">Destruction Technique (絶技).</p>
<p class="orv_line">Breaking the Sky Meteor Strike (破天流星決).</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sword force¹ that could split the night enveloped the tip of Splitting the Sky Sword's blade.</p>
<div class="orv_notice"><p>[1] 검강(劍罡) is a martial arts term which roughly translates to 'high level swordsmanship' that is used by martial artists in Chinese fantasy novels. They are even capable of using their bodies as weapons. '검강' is basically of stronger version of 검기 ("aura of a sword; sword aura; sword energy"). (Explanation from Hardcore Leveling Warrior fandom wiki)</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Bright light cut through the darkness, and Splitting the Sky Sword slashed at something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blood bursting sound could be heard in the air, and for a moment, Cheon Inho's figure, who grabbed his chest, was revealed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk didn't miss the opportunity to strike at Cheon Inho's abdomen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Breaking the Sky Force Punch (破天崩拳).</p>
<p class="orv_line">Third Form (第三式).</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thousand Autumns Phoenix (千秋鳳凰).</p>
<p class="orv_line">A brilliant flame wrapped around Yoo Joonghyuk's fist, and an eardrum-bursting roar exploded from Cheon Inho's abdomen, sending him flying, his body hit a pile of ruins.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsuchuchuchut.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Next, the stars in the sky began to extinguish one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The stars that lit up the night sky, fueling all his stories, were dying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Raphael's star was the first to go, followed by Gabriel's.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The last one was Uriel.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' pays homage to incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk stared at the spot where Uriel's star had disappeared for a long time, and then muttered in a low voice as if talking to them.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I'm sorry." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was unbelievable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk hated the constellations of the night sky more than anyone else in the world. In particular, before he met Kim Dokja, he was the embodiment of vengeance who would not stop regressing until he had knocked out every star in the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And yet, he apologized to the constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My head was spinning, I didn't understand what was going on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was this story in the 40th turn of 'Ways of Survival'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If such a story existed, there's no way Kim Dokja wouldn't have known about it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, the question arose for the first time.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Did 'Ways of Survival' really record all of Yoo Joonghyuk's regressions? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">According to Kim Dokja's narration, yes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Regressions where Yoo Joonghyuk went crazy and gave up quickly were gradually omitted, but there were no regressions that were not recorded in the 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then what is this view I'm looking at.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In Kim Dokja's recollections, Yoo Joonghyuk was not this strong in the early rounds. It took at least hundreds of regressions for him to become strong enough to kill the constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, in the 40th turn, he seemed to be stronger than even the narrative-grade constellations in the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not only was Yoo Joonghyuk stronger, but so was Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Spreading his demonic wings and using the power of stories freely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no way that the meticulous Kim Dokja, who had memorized every single one of the 1,863 turns of Ways of Survival, could not have remembered Cheon Inho like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Kim Dokja knew, he would have thought of the 40th turn Cheon Inho as soon as he saw him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Therefore, there is only one reasonable explanation to this whole situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is a world that Kim Dokja has not read.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 There are world lines that are not written in 'Ways of Survival'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But how?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was like a big bang in my head, like the moment when I thought of the false trauma.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 In the '41st turn', Yoo Joonghyuk sent Shin Yooseung to the past world line, and Shin Yooseung became the 'Disaster of Floods'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment that thought popped into my head, I remembered the snowy landscape that I had walked with Kim Dokja.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 'Ways of Survival' is the story of Yoo Joonghyuk after he turned Shin Yooseung into the 'Disaster of Floods'. 」</p></div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">In the snowy field where I had walked with Kim Dokja, the footprints split in two.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Then, where is the story of Shin Yooseung before she became the 'Disaster of Floods' written down? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There were two footprints, one that went on indefinitely, and one that disappeared in the middle.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The story of the 41st turn with Yoo Joonghyuk before Shin Yooseung became the 'Disaster of Floods'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The story remained only a brief flashback in 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't even properly recorded in the 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I'm looking at the memories of that world right now.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Stop pretending, Cheon Inho, I know you're alive." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At those words, Cheon Inho rose from the pile of ruins.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Now you've lost even your last colleague, Yoo Joonghyuk."<br>"......."<br>"No star is watching over you anymore." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Two swords clashed in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One was Yoo Joonghyuk's Splitting the Sky Sword. The other.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Black Heavenly Demon Sword, you have been in Murim."<br>"Not only in Murim." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The black imprints on Cheon Inho's neck and the backs of his hands were smeared like blood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Demon Force (魔氣).</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho was using demonic energy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The energy that enveloped the Black Heavenly Demon Sword formed into sword force, which then crashed down on Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In response, Yoo Joonghyuk's entire body turned golden.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Transcendent Form (超越形).</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kookookookookoo!</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a bloody battle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho's and Yoo Joonghyuk's magical powers intermittently burned the darkness, and the blazing stories bit into each other's flesh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Covered in blood, Yoo Joonghyuk shouted, and Cheon Inho's left arm flew through the air. Next, Cheon Inho's sword pierced Yoo Joonghyuk's side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, all the light around them disappeared. The two men's magic power was completely exhausted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No stars shone upon them. No stories recorded their battle.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Only I could imagine their fight in this darkness. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A full night. Two men were fighting. Something was slashed, something was torn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They didn't stop. The sound of stabbing and slashing echoed through the blackness of no conversation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Blood dripping, blades breaking, and then,</p>
<p class="orv_line">the sound of someone falling.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Are you satisfied now?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk asked.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Satisfied with what?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho replied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of someone falling was heard once more.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "With ruining this world." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Silence followed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The hard breathing of the two men echoed intermittently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A voice spoke again.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I should have killed you the first time I saw you."<br>"But you didn't."<br>"It was a mistake."<br>"Did you kill them all in the other turns?"<br>"I did."<br>"Then I've succeeded in avenging the last turn. Though I don't remember it anyway." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I heard the sound of blood dripping out. It was impossible to tell whose blood it was.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I never asked you before."<br>"What do you mean?"<br>"Why you live the way you do." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A laugh of disbelief.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I just lived hard. I've only lived a little longer this time."<br>"Honestly, I was surprised this time. I didn't think you'd take on all the Ten Evils."<br>"You underestimated the capabilities of this body."<br>"I admit it."<br>"You should have had me as a colleague sooner." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">They fought and fought and fought, finally reaching the end of this terrible war.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was only at this moment that Cheon Inho's joke was possible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because he had fought as hard as he could.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And because they both realized that this moment was the end of this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a pause, Yoo Joonghyuk's serious voice continued.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I should have. But it's too late for this life." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A muffled laugh echoed in the darkness.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Do you mean to say that in your next life, you will have me as a colleague? The body of the Ten Evil, Evil Sophist, your arch enemy?"<br>"......."<br>"Why don't you answer me, Yoo Joonghyuk?"<br>"That wasn't enough to be my arch enemy." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After a short silence, Yoo Joonghyuk spoke.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "If the world were to repeat itself once more, would you be willing to live a different life?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho was speechless for a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as I wondered if he was dead, the voice continued.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Are you serious? I killed your colleagues."<br>"I know."<br>"And you still want me as one of your colleagues?"<br>"Not quite a colleague, but close."<br>"......Are you out of your mind?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho's voice was filled with hatred for Yoo Joonghyuk and grief for this world.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Why would you need my help? You can repeat the world infinitely anyway. No matter how difficult the scenario is, if you try again and again, you'll eventually clear it."<br>"......."<br>"Don't think of making me your colleague. I will be your enemy in the next turn, and I will be your enemy again, and again, and again." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As he spoke, Chen Inho's breathing became weaker and weaker. Little by little, his physical strength was declining.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Hurry up and press the reset button. Face me as an enemy forever." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There are heroes and there are villains.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho chose the path of the villain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He dismissed all the possibilities and declared that he would become a clown, a villain who was constantly resurrected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then the hero asked.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Why do you think resets are infinite?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I heard someone inhale. Maybe it was my breath.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Cheon Inho." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, a nameless star twinkled somewhere in the deep night sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moon, which had been hidden in the darkness, received the light and illuminated the ground once more.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I can only press the reset button once now." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A chill ran down my spine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the dusky moonlight, Yoo Joonghyuk was looking this way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He seemed to be speaking to me across a distant world line.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "In the next turn, everything in this universe will be destroyed permanently." 」</p></div>
