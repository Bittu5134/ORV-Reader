            <div class="orv_title"><h1>678 Episode 21 Kim Dokja (14)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">As the wall collapsed, memories came flooding in from beyond.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Memories that I didn't believe were mine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sentences that were as distant as the author and the characters seeped into my skin, blood vessels, and brain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see the founder of the Absolute Throne coming towards me in the distance. Although he lost one wing, he survived the explosion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was not dead, but was walking to destroy this world.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 So who am I. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the creeping cold, I thought about my arrogance. The arrogance that tried to contemplate this story, that dared to write about this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Han Sooyoung."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung’s miracle could not be felt anywhere. I didn't feel her story.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Why did you want to become a writer?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Holding Han Sooyoung's sword, I stood up slowly. Now there was no more Han Sooyoung's story that protected me. 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' stopped its storytelling and 'Predicted Plagiarism' failed to predict the future.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It came running high and far away, and I also ran towards it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We cut each other's flesh with each other's swords. I thought about the living pain of the blade cutting into my body.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 You can’t just be a writer. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">To see the ending of this story, you shouldn't be in such a presumptuous position.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I have to live in this world properly. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">We have to face it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We must live in this clear world that exists through blood and swords.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It has to be a unique character.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A person who knows this story better than anyone else. The only person who has the potential to clear this scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The founder of the Absolute Throne asked amidst a storm of magical power.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Who are you Who are you】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I am Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was not [Incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy tilted his head. It seemed like he didn't know who Kim Dokja was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am."</p>
<p class="orv_line">So I did it one more time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said that cursed name.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Recorder of Things that will Disappear' begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A story that was about to disappear stayed with me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I felt the narrative gripping a pen, I recalled the moment I first entered this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of a story I wanted to write. I wanted to write about extras, about things that are forgotten, about things that go unnoticed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had to admit it now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Actually it was all a lie.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I just wanted to tell my story.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Recorder of Things that will Disappear' sucks up the scattered fragments of the story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sentences floating around radiated bright light and seeped into me. The fragments were randomly mixed together, telling me between the lines.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Don’t run away, Kim Dokja." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't want to admit it. I wanted to run away. So I set up a lie.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I am a writer. This is someone who can look at this story objectively.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, I ran away from my past life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't want to become Kim Dokja, so I was reincarnated as myself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the reason why I did not want to become Kim Dokja in my past life was because I wanted to become Kim Dokja more than anyone else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because I thought I couldn’t become Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I gathered all my courage and ran to the god of the other world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The brightly shining 'Unbreakable Faith' exuded the strength of a butcher.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Almost at the same time, the guy's Excalibur also spewed fire.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time as the sharp blade pierced my skin, the sword I swung also cut into its torso.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Oooooooo-】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Through the pitch-black dust, I could see him staggering back a dozen steps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first glance, it was a fatal wound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Its arm no longer regenerates and its only weapon is Excalibur. At least it felt like it was difficult to hold the Excalibur.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stumbled closer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All I have to do is deliver the final blow. With just one final blow, I can begin to change this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsu-</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, my vision flickered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I opened my eyes, my eye level had changed. I realized I was on my knees. The 'Unbreakable faith' that had lost its shine was rolling around on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A bright blue light was shining in the eyes of the founder, who was glaring at us from afar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a king's tale.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsutsu-</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had no strength to resist anymore.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The founder, who was watching my movements from 20 steps away, slowly did it as a test.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He took a step.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now nineteen steps.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The temporary channel will be restored!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Just then, the channel opened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Bihyung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It's out, you bastard! Damn, what is this again! No, what the hell…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sixteen steps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Hey! I'll summon you right now-</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don’t do it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">—What?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took a deep breath, and grabbed the sword that was lying on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m not going back."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At least I can't go back until I kill that guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I corrected myself and looked down at the floor covered in pure white snowflake ash.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't feel her story anywhere else in the world. Nevertheless.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Alive. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to believe that. She must be alive and not dead somewhere. I couldn't bear to not believe that.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Han Sooyoung is alive here. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Between all the lines she wrote and then erased, she remained. I said, sweeping between the lines with my palm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Bihyung."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sent a short message through 'Dokkaebi Communication'. After hearing my story, Bihyung opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I can't help it. It's a violation of the contract, but I'll just ignore it once. As of now, there is no big solution.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung accepted my offer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Instead, I will charge you twice the commission from now on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Next, a scenario came down from thin air.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new sub-scenario has arrived.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Warmth began to return to the place where the story blossomed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'scenario area departure penalty' is lifted.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The cold went away and I returned to the scenario.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Sub Scenario - Founder of the Absolute Throne&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Sub</p>
<p>Difficulty : ???</p>
<p>Clear conditions: Kill the founder of the Absolute Throne</p>
<p>Time limit: —</p>
<p>Compensation : ???</p>
<p>Failure: —</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I read the scenario, I realized how ridiculous the fight I had been in was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A nonsensical enemy that was not listed on the level of difficulty was pushed to the brink of death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was now eleven steps ahead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Right now, I don't have any magic left.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since he knows that fact, he must be secretly approaching me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was one last way left for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that the channel has opened, the stars will be watching me</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will sign a sponsor contract."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The stars in the night sky did not respond to my declaration.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason was quickly apparent.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Nebula &lt;Asgard&gt; laughs at your judgment.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Asgard, who had a grudge because of the previous incident, interfered.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Nebula &lt;Olympus&gt; declares that if it makes a behind-the-scenes contract with the incarnation Cheon Inho, it will be hostile to some constellations.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled into the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is that your choice?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before I knew it, the god of the other world had taken nine steps forward and called my name.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Kim Dokja.】</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The name is important. All stories are complete only when they are named. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Everything in this world is made up of stories, and every story is complete only when it is given a name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Coordinates that designate only one constellation in that vast universe. The only language that can gather the scattered light in the pitch-black night sky.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 At least in this world, there is only one star that can guide me. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A constellation that will not contain the stories I will build and will not force me into unfair contracts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He had many names.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Eight steps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first one was so loud and distant that I couldn't tell exactly what it was called.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The founder's steps began to speed up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The second name was not something I could fully accept yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Seven steps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He did not exist where the third name was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Six steps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And there is only one last name left that I can call.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Five steps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I entered the attack radius, the founder swung Excalibur at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He decided that I no longer had the strength to fight back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Sub-skill 'Sentence Strengthening' is activated!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can enter your actions.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The actions you enter will be reinforced.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can increase the reinforcement level by investing stocked probability.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Current probability: 580]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Using all the probability I have.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I will make a contract." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He will definitely read these words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swung my sword with all my remaining strength.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wow!</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Unbreakable Faith' collided with Excalibur and flew through the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the god of another world twisted his trajectory to aim for my waist, I jumped up and swung the sword I had taken out of my back bag.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just in time, my sword cut into his side first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The founder looked surprised, as if he thought I had almost no energy left. His guess was true.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But he won't know. From now on, what will happen before his eyes?</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Oooooh-】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The guy must have sensed something strange and walked back, gesturing at his skull.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I got sick.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I will take a step forward and take a breath. The story of the ark, overflowing from my entire body, were gathering in my blade.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 That's my favorite story. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Without hesitation, I swung my sword at the screaming guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The shank was trained much more neatly than the [Baekcheonganggi] I use, and it was very good on the guy's upper abdomen.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Goooooooo-】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The confused guy was trying to communicate with the other side of the veil through a link in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I had no intention of allowing that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Death Sword."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I said those words, the constellations engraved on the body of the Death Sword sword began to glow one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Originally, to reveal all the constellations of the 'Death Sword', seven great-level constellations were needed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But now, it was limited to just one constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The startled outer god screamed and trembled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is a great god of another world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This guy wasn't afraid of the relics of the great constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He recognized the story behind this sword.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'King of a Kingless World' begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I cut the sword stuck in the guy's chest and split off his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Its body split in half and scattered with a scream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The link was broken.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sparks emitted in the air, and eventually the wick touched and burned like a candle with only a few moments remaining.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Sub-scenario cleared!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The fourth main scenario has ended.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have achieved an achievement that does not exist]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A significant number of constellations have entered the temporary channel.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Stars were rising one by one above the pitch black curtain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations took risks and came to the 'Great Hall' to see me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Administrative Bureau' praises your achievements.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Management Bureau' is preparing a reward appropriate for your achievements]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new story has been acquired.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Stars appeared in the night sky when the king disappeared. Looking up at the stars, I thought of a man who had seen the same scene as me a long time ago.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The story is still Kim Dokja’s story. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A name I hated, hated, and loved.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 But it’s still not a story for just one Kim Dokja. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation that did not reveal their modifier reveals their modifier.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation contract has been completed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked up at our star while carrying the fallen 41st Yoo Joonghyuk on my back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The star that Yoo Joonghyuk and so many people so desperately wanted to find, the star that I thought I couldn't find, and the star that Han Sooyoung wanted to meet.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your sponsor is the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]</p></div>
