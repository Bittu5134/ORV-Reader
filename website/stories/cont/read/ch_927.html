            <div class="orv_title"><h1>927 Episode 53 Record War (3)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kugugugugu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could hear the sound of probability gathering around the request to activate [Time of Judgment]. However, it wasn't a moment to relax.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The key activation condition for [Time of Judgment] requested by the 'Judge of Demon Destruction' was 'the consent of all Constellations within the channel'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If even one Constellation consents to the activation, [Time of Judgment] will be activated.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Heewon-ssi, please tell him exactly what I say from now on.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Watching Jung Heewon nod across the screen, I observed the constellations' reactions.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some Constellations shook their heads.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A very small number of Constellations question the appropriateness of viewing the 'Flame of Purification' as a 'monster'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The reactions were as expected.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', asks if he's a monster at that level.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, there were other Great-grade Constellations, including 'Bald General of Justice', who were sympathetic to us, but even they weren't likely to agree to [Time of Judgment].</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a Great-grade Constellation, not even a Narrative-grade, to oppose a massive Nebula would be to invite disaster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Agni laughed, perhaps thinking we were cornered.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 [It was an interesting strategy, but do you dare think there's a star that can oppose &lt;Vedas&gt;?] 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As Agni had said, the sky was calm to the point of indifference. It was only natural.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No Constellation here would think Jung Heewon could defeat Agni.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I wasn't fazed.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "There are no Constellations, but there are incarnations." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon calmly recited the lines I had given her.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "If the Supreme King were here, he wouldn't have said such things." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Agni looked down at Jung Heewon, as if she were saying something out of the blue. Jung Heewon, who was actually saying it, looked somewhat worried.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She probably doesn't understand why I made her say that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't really explain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because—</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Supreme King? Did you just say Supreme King?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The reason I made her say that was because he had just appeared from among the ruins.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Mad Sword Emperor! I knew it! You really knew something about the Supreme King!" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana, the leader of the Salvation Church, had been chasing the Mad Sword Emperor. He had finally appeared on the battlefield.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Tell me! What on earth do you know? Why are you using the Supreme King's swordsmanship! 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Agni's expression twisted at the unexpected intruder.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 [Is there a child who hasn't run away yet?] 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "You cheeky Constellation, isn't this body speaking right now?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, Nirvana, in a fit of madness for Yoo Joonghyuk, remained undaunted even before that Narrative-grade Constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Agni murmured, glancing at Nirvana with a strange gaze.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 [Is that Seokjun's pet?] 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Agni sighed softly, perhaps because rumors about Nirvana had already spread to Vedas.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 [I'll close my eyes once I see him. Get out.] 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Agni unleashed his power, and a heavy burden fell over the area once again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana's expression hardened for a moment, then reacted.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Are you ordering me to do this?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even though he was the Leader of the Salvation Church, his opponent was a Constellation of the 'Late Stage Narrative-grade'. Even though running away was not something to be ashamed of, he showed no signs of retreating. Then it's time for someone to light the fire.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Savior. If you help me here, I'll give you what you want.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon repeated my words, and Nirvana cheered.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Good. Mad Sword Emperor! Then become one with me and—" 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "The regression of the Supreme King ends with this Round." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana's eyes slowly dilated.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "If you want to hear more, save me." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The next moment, Agni's fiery heat enveloped my vision.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thankfully, a palm pierced through the fierce flames, protecting the two. Nirvana's [Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara] had activated.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "What do you mean? This Round is the end? Where on earth did you hear that?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana, glaring, added in a faintly dazed voice.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "And… why do I smell my 'follower' on you?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled bitterly. As expected of a reincarnated being, he's quick-witted.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 [Foolish mortals...] 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Agni's fiery anger was intensifying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But even Nirvana was no easy opponent.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I'm not a mortal, but a reincarnated being, you foolish Constellation." 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara, charging forward with a desperate resolve, blocked the fiery anger. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, even Nirvana wouldn't be able to defeat Agni. At best, he'd only be able to hold out for a few minutes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had to make good use of the precious time he'd given me.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Are you planning to use that 'method' from earlier?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Bicheonhori already seemed to know what I was planning.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【That method?】</p></div>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【A method to temporarily become a Constellation.】</p></div>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【What you mentioned is a good method, though.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If I activate 'Demon King of Salvation Mode', I can temporarily wield powers equivalent to a 'Constellation'. Then, perhaps, even briefly, it might be possible to agree to [The Hour of Judgment]. But...</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 A deep, bloody scent burned from the distant stories Agni lived in. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The blood of the living creatures he slew with his own axe filled the surroundings like fog. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The ceaseless, pulsating heat burned the fog, like waves... 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sentences of the recorders flowed in real time. The pace of the sentences was so fast that catching and erasing them one by one seemed impossible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, a peculiar sentence flashed before my eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Agni often glanced warily at the sky. As if he was reluctant to allow anyone to interfere in this battlefield. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【If my thoughts are correct, there will be a Constellation that will aid us.】</p></div>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Are you waiting for &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; or the Constellations of other worldlines?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">How wonderful that would be.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shook my head with a wry smile.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【This time, it's a different Constellation.】</p></div>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【There's no way a Constellation could stand against Agni.】</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Gyaaaaaaaah!" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, unable to withstand Agni's heat, the [Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara] melted.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【No, there is.】</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The activation conditions for 'Hour of Judgment' have been met.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Amidst the message, a terrifying energy wave surged from Jung Heewon's body. Jung Heewon leaped up in one breath and activated [Vermilion God's Treasure], striking with a flash of lightning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The black goat Agni was riding let out a cry as if in a fit of convulsion. A pitch-black story leaped into the air. Agni muttered in shock.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 [No way—] 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment he raised his head, a single Constellation shone brightly in the sky.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation, 'God of Wine and Ecstasy', consents to the activation of 'Hour of Judgment'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Dionysus, God of Wine and Ecstasy. He agreed to Jung Heewon's [Time of Judgment].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Agni glared and unleashed a mantra.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 [Foolish prodigal son of Olympus! How dare you side with that incarnation?] 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Dionysus also unleashed an indirect message at that terrifying mantra.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation, 'God of Wine and Ecstasy', pretends otherwise.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even if Dionysus was one of the twelve gods of Olympus, confronting the Locapala of Vedas head-on was a risky undertaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, Dionysus chose the 'Mad Sword Emperor'.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Suddenly, 'Dionysus'?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled, and Bicheonhori asked, his voice threatening.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Could it be that you planned this? Since when?】</p></div>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Since I heard the information from 'Moral'.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Moral said. Dionysus is currently independent from Olympus. In that situation, I was certain he would take a different path than the existing Olympus.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Could it be that you used [Fate] on Dionysus?】</p></div>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Similar.】</p></div>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Even if it were [Fate], it wouldn't be possible to force the choice of a Narrative-grade Constellation.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That's right. Even for a Recorder, manipulating a Narrative-grade being by imposing [Fate] on them is nearly impossible. [Fate], granted improbably, has its limits, and above all, all characters possess 'free will'.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【I didn't force it.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I shrugged and showed him the sentence I'd written.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Dionysus thought. 'A Mad Sword Emperor. A Transcendent that chooses a direct confrontation with Agni, the Lokapala?' 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Bicheonhori glared at my sentence,</p>
<p class="orv_line">as if trying to discern some hidden interpretation hidden beneath the words.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【This is all there is to the [Fate] you wrote?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My task was simple: to make Dionysus interested in the Mad Sword Emperor.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Dionysus will undoubtedly need a new 'base' after the independence of &lt;Olympus&gt;.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">For now, I thought that was enough.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just by making him aware of the Mad Sword Emperor, Dionysus would have deemed her useful in the 'next scenario'. Bicheonhori exclaimed in admiration.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【You're truly crazy.】</p></div>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Thank you for the compliment. Please donate some coins.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The atmosphere on the battlefield changed with Dionysus' intervention.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kugugugugu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His body, strengthened to the limit by the power of [Time of Judgment], Jung Heewon's sword began to move as if dancing.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 It's not enough. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The trajectory of the [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship], which she had swung tens of thousands of times every day, was becoming darker.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Faster, stronger. Listening to her thoughts, I slowly closed my eyes. The stage was set, so it was my turn to step forward.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 What does it take for a character to unleash their full potential? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Bichonhori said.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【I can't give you coins, but I can lend you a line or two.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With that, a phrase flashed through my mind. It was a line from Bicheonhori, author of 「The 100 Strongest」.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "You can't always say life is better than death." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A line from Jung Heewon, who was simply called the 'Mad Butcher', unable to even find her own name in the main story.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "It would be even more so if there was nothing to protect." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The story of her suffering, unable to protect what was precious, had been passed down across the worldline to this place.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 IhavetoprotectIhavetoprotectIhavetoprotectIhavetoprotectIhavetoprotect... 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A round that seemed to continue on for eternity. Beyond the thoughts, I felt as if I could grasp the years she had lived. Bicheonhori added with a pleased smile.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【As expected, what strengthens a stage is 'repetition' and 'utilization'.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Above the maddening prelude laid by Bicheonhori, the history she and I had built began to flow.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Heewon-ssi... I love you... It's true..." 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "What are you doing?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I first met her at Geumho Station.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Can you support me from behind?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I'd love to, but my arms are like this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Support me with your back. Like this!"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">The time we were eaten by a dragon and, after many twists and turns, escaped together.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Good job, Heewon-ssi." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And the death of Sergeant Jung Moonho at Seoul Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even the moment we witnessed the sound together.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 That's how Jung Heewon became the 'Light Sword Emperor'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I intervened in her life, and she willingly became my story. She became a sword, unbreakable by any tragedy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So now, she and I were thinking the same thing.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I will never let you die. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">We will not let each other die.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The Axe of God and the Sword of Man clashed in the air. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The scenery distorted, and a violent thunderbolt struck the sky.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation, 'God of Wine and Ecstasy', cannot take its eyes off the battle.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', stops wiping his hair.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation, 'Lying Dragon' closes the book he was reading.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation, 'Monarch of the Small Fries, widens his eyes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">All the Constellations in the channel were focused on the battle, perhaps not expecting such a bloody battle in just scenario number 70.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation, 'Monarch of the Small Fries', cannot take his eyes off the battle between gods and humans.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The pure power of the story, captivating even the Constellations of the Giant Nebulae and the small and medium Constellations.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation, 'Maritime War God, has entered the channel.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Constellation, 'Maritime War God, feels a strange sense of deja vu during your battle.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The &lt;Star Stream&gt; begins to show the presence of that area.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As the stage grew larger, the density of probability filling Agni's entire being also increased.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 [With just such a piece of history.] 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A divine strike, peeking at the Myth-grade position. An axe engulfed in fiery flames struck the ground. Nirvana, caught in the raging winds of red flame, collapsed on the ground without even a scream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A god's shadow fell over Nirvana's incarnation body.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 [Do you truly believe you can stand against a 'god'?] 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Nirvana struggled, trampled by Agni.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The vastly longer history between gods and humans unfolded before our eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 As the flames engulfed the land, the mountain ranges blackened like giant altars, and rivers evaporated and rose into the sky. Countless starlights were absorbed and scattered by the flames, and even the sun wavered before them like a faint lantern. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 What I heard was the language of fire, the heartbeat of the universe as flames collided with each other. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Purification is Agni's declaration of liberation. Mother Nature's command to be purified by fire and reborn. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A force that became [Fate] simply by repeating history.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw Bicheonhori shaking his head.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【It was an interesting fight, but it was a match that was impossible from the start.】</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The God of Flame was there. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even I, looking beyond the screen, felt a shiver. An enemy that even a Transcendent Stage 4 [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship] couldn't cut.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw Jung Heewon's face darken, biting her lip.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【You provoked the Constellations too much. The Flame of Purification is a 'Locapala'. Did you really think a mere incarnation could defeat him, who was on the verge of Mythical promotion?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps it was something I wouldn't have done before. Using Jung Heewon to provoke the Constellations and expand the stage—there was absolutely no benefit to doing something like that right away.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【What on earth were you thinking…?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But right now, this was the only way to save Jung Heewon.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【This is my thought.】</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The aftershock of probability is coming!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The excessive abuse of probability finally led to the aftershock of probability.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Agni frowned and stared into the sky.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Balance of Probability' is beginning to tip!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Due to the intervention of the Recorders and the Giant Nebulae, Agni used probability beyond what was permitted in the 'New Murim District'.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The scales of probability are fair, so if one side of the scale tilts, a corresponding 'probability' is inevitably opened up on the other side. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, the conditions for a being comparable to Agni to be powerful in this city have just been met.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Great Hall' is being created!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sky in the scenario turned pitch black, and the 'Great Hall' appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【The 'Great Hall' has the characteristic of summoning 'otherworldly deities' with deep temporal, spatial, and lore ties to the area.】</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 And the 'Outer God' most closely connected to this 'city' is... 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsu, a portal swirled open before my eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story, 'King of Fear' is with you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The scenario was calling me.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Watch closely, Bicheonhori.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced at Bicheonhori, who was glaring at me, and stepped into the portal.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Because the ending I'm about to write begins here.】</p></div>
