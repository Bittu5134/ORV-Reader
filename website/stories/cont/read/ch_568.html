<p class="orv_line">being infected with Thought Infection. Was it the scene where Lee Hyunsung threw his whole</p>
<p class="orv_line">body to stop Jung Hee Won&#39;s runaway?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That little girl is like us...... right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think so.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I decided to contact her fisrt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, as I approached, the girl started screaming.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Uwaak! Help!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Excuse me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He&#39;s going to kill me, and even if he doesn&#39;t, he&#39;s going to do something bad anyway!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was about to say that there&#39;s no way I&#39;d do such a thing, but then I remembered that I was</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I held my hands up lightly, signaling that I meant no offense.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, I was just saying hello.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I was saying that, Bang Cheolsoo, who had popped up from the side, shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Listen up! From now on, our Cheoldoo Group will occupy Geumho Station! Drop everything</p>
<p class="orv_line">you&#39;re carrying and head over there—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I punched Bang Cheolsoo in the back of the head with all my might.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Monarch of the Small Fries&#39; has sponsored you 100 coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After backing down Bang Cheolsoo, who looked back at me in frustration, I looked at the girl</p>
<p class="orv_line">again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m not a bad person, you seem to misunderstand something.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#39;t come, you villain!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;She&#39;s telling you not to come.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon&#39;s voice was determined as she hid the girl behind her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The girl poked her head over Jung Heewon&#39;s shoulder and looked at me with a pleased face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So that&#39;s how it is.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sighed lightly and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It can&#39;t be helped, so let&#39;s just talk like this.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon looked back and forth between me and the girl, then asked her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is that okay?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The girl looked at Jung Heewon in confusion, and Jung Heewon looked back at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;She&#39;s scared, you can talk to her another time.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I have no intention of threatening her, and if I do, Jung Heewon-ssi can stop me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I called for Bang Cheolsoo and was given a pipe. Just when Jung Heewon&#39;s expression hardened</p>
<p class="orv_line">as if she thought I had finally shown my true colors, I handed the pipe to her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you see me threatening her, hit me over the head with this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hard.&quot;</p>
[The constellation &#39;Monarch of the Small Fries&#39;s eyes are shining.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon stared down at the pipe she had been given, then said in a bewildered voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t intend to go that far.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then let&#39;s get started.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I cleared my throat with a hmm, and began to speak in a theatrical voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I like Jung Heewon.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;......?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon looked at me with confused eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;From today on, I will do 100 push-ups, 100 squats, and run 10 kilometers every day to become</p>
<p class="orv_line">a man worthy of Heewon-nim.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon looked like she didn&#39;t know whether to slap me on the head or not.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Heewon-nim... I love you... Seriously...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you doing?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I can do the same as Lee-&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Now, wait!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The contemplative girl eventually popped out from behind Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smirked and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you ready to talk now? Judge Heewon—&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The girl who quickly covered my mouth looked back at Jung Heewon and smiled awkwardly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Unni. I&#39;m sorry, I guess I got the wrong person.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you okay? It sounds like you&#39;re being blackmailed?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No! I&#39;m really not, so don&#39;t worry!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the shaken girl, I was once again convinced.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This must be him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is the same person who sat next to me in the event theater.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nickname [Judge Heewon].</p>
<p class="orv_line">The muscular man who answered the trivia question about the name of Jung Heewon&#39;s sword,</p>
<p class="orv_line">roared, jumped on stage, and came to possess someone in this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wait, I thought he was a man?</p>
<p class="orv_line">He, or she, who was now a tiny girl, even tinier than Jung Heewon, spoke over my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why don&#39;t we go over there and talk?&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That...... Cheon Inho?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who the hell are you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judge Heewon looked at me and ahjussi with fear in her eyes, as if she were trying to figure out</p>
<p class="orv_line">who we were by our looks. But there was no way she could have known who I was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized that I needed to let her guard down a bit. Luckily, I had learned the social language to</p>
<p class="orv_line">use in this situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Jung Heewon is great.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What? Of course.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judge Heewon&#39;s expression became strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait, you-?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Your nickname is funny.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That all-carer? The one with the pretty girl?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That...... Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The one who couldn&#39;t get a single question right!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I got a question right, which is why I&#39;m here.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Judge Heewon opened her mouth in a daze. She seemed to be organizing the situation in her</p>
<p class="orv_line">head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I added for reassurance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m in the same boat as you, and so is this ahjussi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi bowed slightly with a polite face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judge Heewon muttered in a trembling voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I see, I&#39;m not the only one.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judge Heewon looked at us with hollow eyes, as if she was going to burst into tears at any</p>
<p class="orv_line">moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I really thought I was going to die, but at least I remembered the first scenario.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How did you clear it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The usual, bugs are the law of the land.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging by the smugness in her voice, she had contributed to making a mess of the first scenario</p>
<p class="orv_line">just like me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Actually, I almost died in the middle of the scenario when it was twisted up...... I got lucky. I</p>
<p class="orv_line">was trapped with Heewon-nim.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was trapped with Jung Heewon.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, it was thanks to Judge Heewon that Jung Heewon survived without killing anyone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After taking a low breath, Judge Heewon said softly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Phew...... Anyway, if you&#39;re a reader too, you should have told me sooner. That was close.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;ve been trying to tell you all along, but you&#39;ve been hiding and criticizing me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I didn&#39;t think someone would possessed Cheon Inho. Why Cheon Inho?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why am I Cheon Inho?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder that too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In any case, Judge Heewon seemed to have completely lost her animosity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;First of all, let&#39;s introduce each other. I&#39;m Cheon Inho, as you can see.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m Lee Dansoo.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hearing our names, Judge Heewon nodded in understanding.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s the rule to speak by your given name, like in TRPG?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I started to say, but stopped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judge Heewon said her new nickname with a shy face.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m Kyung Sein.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Can I call you Judge Heewon?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You should call me Kyung Sein.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">She&#39;s an adaptable person.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was still the first day of the scenario, and there was a lot of work to do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi had a poor memory, but Kyung Sein was a voracious reader who remembered</p>
<p class="orv_line">quite a lot.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;After all, it&#39;s a national rule to collect food first at Geumho Station.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder who set that rule.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s like we all got together and made a &#39;How to Deal with the Apocalypse in Omniscient Reader&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, we decided to split up and rob vending machines and mini convenience stores.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo and the Cheoldoo Group joined us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">About thirty minutes passed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is this it? Have you checked all the convenience stores nearby?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, this is it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We had succeeded in collecting all the food in Geumho Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are currently 134 people trapped inside Geumho Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was only enough food for one day.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What should we do? Should we sell them for coins?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, we&#39;ll just give them away.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could have sold them for coins and made a small profit, as Kim Dokja did. But I didn&#39;t choose</p>
<p class="orv_line">that option.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein agreed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to accept coins from those people. Kim Dokja was definitely not</p>
<p class="orv_line">normal.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sein-ssi, please distribute it to the people over there. Cheolsoo, you go to the other side.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Alright.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Dansoo ahjussi, you can share with me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As we distributed the food, I looked at the faces of the citizens one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t realize it when I wrote this scene.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The looks on the faces of people who had just killed someone to survived.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The dead in the first scenario all had their heads explode. The pale faces of the dead now rested</p>
<p class="orv_line">on the faces of the living.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As some of you may already know, there are monsters roaming outside right now, and it&#39;s wise</p>
<p class="orv_line">to stay safe here and wait for rescue.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you really think rescue will come?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They will come.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, the rescuers wouldn&#39;t come.</p>
[There are currently 48 people in Geumho Station who support you.]</p></div>
[Currently 35% of Geumho Station supports you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Not bad. At this rate, I should be able to capture Geumho Station in the next 30 minutes and</p>
<p class="orv_line">complete the scenario.</p>
[The constellations of the &#39;absolute good&#39; system are impressed by your dedication.]</p></div>
[100 coins have been sponsored.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In addition, I have gained the favor of the constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The project to rehabilitate Cheon Inho was progressing steadily.</p>
[The character &#39;Bang Cheolsoo&#39; feels an unknown emotion.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And maybe, Bang Cheolsoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheolsoo hyung-nim. Are you doing well?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t know. Something&#39;s tickling me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As they handed out the bread and snacks and they were thanked, the Cheoldoo Group looked</p>
<p class="orv_line">somewhat reminiscent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is probably the first time they&#39;ve ever heard anyone thank them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know how much of the story could have been changed by adding them a few extra</p>
<p class="orv_line">sentences.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But sometimes, even if you can&#39;t change anything, there&#39;s something you want to write. Like a</p>
<p class="orv_line">question you can&#39;t help but ask even though you know the answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Have you seen a girl named No Jiyoon?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi, who was helping distribute food next to me, would ask people the same question</p>
<p class="orv_line">over and over again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t know, what does she look like?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That...... All I know is her name.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Jiyoon is the name of his daughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Actually, I&#39;m sure Dansoo ahjussi knows it. Even if he ask people for his daughter&#39;s name here,</p>
<p class="orv_line">he won&#39;t find her. His daughter is probably living under a different name, possessing a</p>
<p class="orv_line">completely different person.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, he didn&#39;t stop asking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if the name alone was proof, in this strange and unfamiliar world, that he was not Lee</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo, but someone&#39;s father.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at him for a moment, then opened my phone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A platform app popped up on the screen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surely I had once been the author of Omniscient Reader. But could I still call myself the author</p>
<p class="orv_line">of that novel?</p>
<p class="orv_line">All I have left to prove that time is this.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint - 567 chapters</p>

</div>
<p class="orv_line">I stared blankly at the title of my novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know how long I did that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I got goosebumps on my spine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What the hell?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glared at the screen once more, specifically at the number of chapters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sure enough, the &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39; I knew had been completed in chapter 551.</p>
