            <div class="orv_title"><h1>669 Episode 21 Kim Dokja (5)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Absolute Throne' was shining in the distance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A seat where only one king can sit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At one time, Han Sooyoung also wanted to sit in that seat. She believed that if she sat down there, she would be compensated for all the sorrow she had endured.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was until she realized that even that desire was nothing more than a play for the constellations.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A significant number of constellations are aware of your presence.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Very few constellations are concerned about your intervention.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some constellations are requesting the Bureau to review your probability.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">She could feel the gaze of the stars across the distant sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will the stars understand her story now?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation that has not yet revealed its modifier is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What she wanted was farther and farther away than that throne.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was so distant that she couldn't quite tell what it was.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 She had no reason to intervene in this situation. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This was the 41st round’s normal development.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk, in the 41st round, will take the 'absolute throne' and walk the path of a supreme king who rules over everything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No one will be able to stand on the same level as him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No path will arise for him.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Just leave it alone. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If she just sat back and watched, the 41st round would end up in failure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the end of this story, Yoo Joonghyuk, in despair, will send Shin Yoosoung to the past.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That ends the story of this world line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja will return to her again after reading all of her stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He has to come back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For his sake, she must not move. Not write even a single sentence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She has to let the characters move and flow. She knew it well. But why?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Joonghyuk. If you sit over there, it’s all over."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did she finally pick up the pen?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You guessed it too, right? What the absolute throne is."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, she knows the answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even now, when she closes her eyes, the memory comes to mind clearly. It may be because she saw something she shouldn't have seen.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "What you’re trying to do is not end the story, but give up." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja, whom she ignored. Kim Dokja, who did not want to be reborn as Kim Dokja again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, Kim Dokja had to return to this story again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She found Kim Dokja and that's why she's here now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you Han Sooyoung?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk of the 41st round was looking at her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung asked bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who told you my name?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung quietly stared at the Yoo Joonghyuk from the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I owed you a beating last time."</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was her second fight with Yoo Joonghyuk in the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you think this time will be different?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It will be different."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It looks like your learning ability is poor. If you’ve ever fought, you’d know that, right? It’s not for me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">On the rooftop of the theater dungeon, she bumped into Yoo Joonghyuk once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She risked the odds and drew on her story, and she took advantage of the weakness of 'regressive depression' to subdue Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But is that possible this time too?</p>
<p class="orv_line">She couldn't figure it out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, you must have regressed more than 40 times."</p>
<p class="orv_line">She didn't know, so she deliberately provoked him. She tried to spy on the guy's reaction, but Yoo Joonghyuk didn't come over. His eyes, deep as the sea of ​​silk, just stared at her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All surrounding sounds disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tension weighing heavily on the area. Silence where not a single insect cries.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The one who moved first was Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of something being pushed away was heard one step later, and his black spear and her white sword clashed in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her magical power and his physical power intertwined, and a tearing sound rose through the rain clouds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She lost.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kaaaaang!</p>
<p class="orv_line">A lightning-like dramatic impact weighed heavily on Han Sooyoung. Let's believe in her spirit and her skills. Yoo Joonghyuk opened his  mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It seems you also know about regression."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"So are you surprised?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I expected it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk spoke without even raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Because there were a lot of strange people in this round."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Strange guys. Han Sooyoung knew who he was referring to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Everyone said they knew me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her sharp emotions were buried at the end of her words. The anger of the returner who had been forged again and again was condensing.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'’s 'Spiritual Soul Height Lv.10' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Black magical power swirled in the gravitational force of the spear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung’s expression hardened at the creepy waveform of magical power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From now on, it's real.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung took her chances and opened up her own stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With the sound of her striking the black flame dragon's holy soul drum, which made her called her special flame black dragon Emperor, the pole pole filled with her [Earth and Soul Field] and the dot pole filled with [special flame] collided.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was Han Sooyoung and she was confident.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though Yoo Joonghyuk was a powerful martial artist, there was no way he could stand up to her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Coo coo coo coo!</p>
<p class="orv_line">A magic wave that turns one side of the sky pitch black.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first to be pushed out was Han Sooyoung. Han Sooyoung's expression was so disgusted that she cried and swallowed the blood that came up her throat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Nonsense.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how the aftereffects of probability were, she was the one who saw the end of the scenarios twice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Yoo Joonghyuk floating in the sky right now was only Yoo Joonghyuk from the 41st round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But how?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Don’t underestimate me in the 41st round." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">One step too late, the advice of her fellow regressor came to mind.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "It’s only the 41st round, so what?" 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "His character may be different." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This world was not even recorded in Ways of Survival.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a sense, it is a world line that writer Han Sooyoung does not really know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk lived a 41-rounds life that no one recorded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That Yoo Joonghyuk was speaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you know me too?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung bit her lip.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 She said, "You are the one who sent Shin Yoosoung to the past because you thought you couldn’t do it alone. How strong can a guy who gave up so easily be?" 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "That’s the problem." 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "What?" 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "There is no way I could have collapsed that much in only the 41st round." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung looked at Yoo Joonghyuk. He was telling the story embedded in his whole body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That story is proof of his life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung slowly felt a chill go down her spine.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "In that world line, I have given up on the possibility of the next round. I probably saw a despair that I couldn't overcome no matter how hard I tried. I concluded that I, who can return on my own, cannot see the end without sending Shin Yoosoung to another world line." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes, Han Sooyoung thinks about the regressor.</p>
<p class="orv_line"> the world, excluding the regressor, regresses.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The soul of the regressor continues to age and memories accumulate.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Touching and sick heart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Endless depression and madness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung also knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Regression was not a curse that an ordinary human could bear, and Yoo Joonghyuk was not an ordinary human.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Steel-like mentality and unwavering spirit. Yoo Joonghyuk is a person who is so strong that he cannot be described simply as 'strong'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A protagonist created to endure a number of 1,863 regressions.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "If I made such an extreme judgment in only the 41st round." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 'main character' gave up his future in only the 41st round. And he tied the future to his past self.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "That guy did his best to the point where he couldn’t survive his next life." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"It seems you don’t know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A story arose.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's an endlessly cancerous and ominous story that they don't know when or how it was acquired.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Really strong. It's hard to believe that it's the 41st round. He seems stronger than any other 'Yoo Joonghyuk' who lived through the fourth scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If she uses Kim Dokja Company's story, she can win. But if she does that…</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The &lt;Star Stream&gt; is reacting to your choices.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This time, the probability of this world will not forgive her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ga-ga-ga-ga-gak!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Seeing Yoo Joonghyuk's sword flying, Han Sooyoung also swung her sword in front of her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Once, twice, three times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Every time her spear and sword clashed, the sound of her grip being torn apart could be heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her blood flowed and her nerves became numb little by little.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Four times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung finally lost her sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Unbreakable Faith' broke and fell to the ground.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A moment's gap.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk did not hesitate. As if there was no place for her in this world, Yoo Joonghyuk threw out his spear with a cold motion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A slow blow to the heart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung looked down at her own wounds as if she couldn't believe it, and then looked up at Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was the last time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a life-threatening wound that did not need to be repeated twice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk retrieved his own spear the moment after seeing Han Sooyoung had disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It hurts, kid."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A voice came from behind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk, startled, immediately tried to swing the spear backwards.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you know how much memory loss there is once your avatar dies?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Two small, soft hands wrapped around his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsuchut!</p>
<p class="orv_line">A dazzling spark and a terrible shock engulfed Yoo Joonghyuk's mind. Unable to withstand the aftermath, Yoo Joonghyuk's whole body trembled like an aspen tree.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story in Han Sooyoung’s hands burrowed into Yoo Joonghyuk’s head.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "The stronger the guy, the heavier the weight of his despair." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This is what her colleague told her.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Probably, he will easily sink to just one feather." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung knew better than anyone else what the weakness of a regressor who experienced deep despair was.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The gaint story, 'Kim Dokja’s Company' begins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">His stomach churned and his whole body trembled as if he had been shocked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What do happy memories taste like, you bastard?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Memories of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; flowed from her fingertips.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Why is that kid so good at cooking?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Memories of Kim Dokja and her stealing Yoo Joonghyuk's dishes and eating them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Memories of the picnic where &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; gathered together and left. In their story that had not yet ended, Kim Dokja that she remembered was speaking.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Next time, let’s bring more beef." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung looked at the story blankly. The fact that such a time even existed now seemed unrealistic.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A person who can exist only in sentences.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The stories that were clearly her memories now seemed like lies in a novel written by someone else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung smiled as she looked at Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes that had turned white.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m about to die of happiness."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Happiness. As she pronounced that word, Han Sooyoung momentarily tilted her head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What was that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it because the avatar died and lost some of her memories? Han Sooyoung couldn't immediately remember the meaning of that word. Perhaps that wasn't all she had lost.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, she trusted Han Sooyoung.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Lotus Flower Blooming Under the Moonlight' is watching you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Her companion who would remember those words for her.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I told you I’d try to persuade you. Are you ready to be persuaded?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Find a writer to write her story for her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You damn son of a bitch."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung finally understood her own actions, muttering a phrase that she would never use.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All writers were readers before they were writers, and Han Sooyoung was the same.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I'm curious about the story he makes. Even after all that hardship, he came back to this world, and the story he wanted to tell was.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Lotus Flower Blooming Under the Moonlight' looks at you with sad eyes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">So she stopped Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer' bows his head.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">She acted arbitrarily without consulting with other members of &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You think so too, Yoo Joonghyuk?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe because of her choice, she knew that all the plans she had made could go wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Taking a light breath, Han Sooyoung lifted the stunned Yoo Joonghyuk onto her shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She didn't have much time left now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk will wake up soon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the meantime, she must destroy the 'Absolute Throne'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only then will this scenario end.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 But there was something she didn’t know. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung suddenly felt the hairs on the back of her hand stand up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a deafening sound, she heard the strange sound of a huge scale tipping from somewhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung immediately realized what was happening. She has participated in this scenario on other floating ships, so it is unlikely that the abnormality she caused would lead to a riot, but she did not expect the fallout to take this form.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The probability was running wild.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung opened her mouth without realizing it. She knew this feeling well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The 'Great Hall' opens."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A huge hole was opening beyond the black swirling sky.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The gods of this world have noticed your presence!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The scales of probability are in equilibrium.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The owner of the 'Absolute Throne' was appearing beyond the 'Great Hall of the Sky'.</p>
