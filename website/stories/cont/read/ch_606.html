            <div class="orv_title"><h1>606 Episode 11 Artwork (1)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">These days, whenever I pass out, I have a thought. Maybe I will meet Kim Dokja again this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was always thinking of questions to ask when meeting Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Where are you now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did you call me here?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What story are you reading right now?</p>
[Current state of consciousness is unstable.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Unfortunately, when I opened my eyes, it was not a snowy field.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see the dark scene of the theater around me. It was a theater where kkomas Kim Dokja was gathered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as I woke up, I thought of Jung Jaewoo. At the last moment, Jung Jaewoo disappeared as a “kkoma Kim Dokja.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe he&#39;s here too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">People huddled around the theater and sat down. Small backs of heads were visible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it had been before, I would have thought of it as cute, but now a part of my heart felt cold.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps, aren’t these “kkoma Kim Dokjas” all dead readers?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I slowly opened my mouth and tried to call Jung Jaewoo&#39;s name,</p>
「&quot;Yoo Joonghyuk.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Voices came from the speakers in front.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were two people on the screen. One is Yoo Joonghyuk in a black coat, and the other…</p>
「&quot;Who are you?&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk asked, and someone answered.</p>
「&quot;The one who came to finish your story.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It felt like my heart was sinking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I cannot be done.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Those two shouldn&#39;t fight now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I have to get out of here right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt my body slowly disintegrate. My consciousness will be awakened again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wow, the fight of the century!</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the last moment, I heard the kkoma Kim Dokja beside me shouting like that.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">When I woke up, Killer King was kicking me with his foot.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re a weakling. To think you&#39;ve lost your mind with just such a wound.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I groaned lightly and got up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a dark night. I could faintly feel the warmth of the bonfire.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seems that I got help from the Killer King siblings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Please eat.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King’s younger sister supported me and handed me a teacup. When I sniffed it, it turned out that it was someone who had put herbs in it and boiled it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging by the color and scent, it seems that Elaine&#39;s “dawn dew” or “Baekoncho” was added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All of them were food ingredients that did not appear in the main story when reading.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s not venom, so there&#39;s no doubt about it. I won’t do that twice.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I just smelled it because I liked the smell of tea.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is a newly discovered medicine. It&#39;s good for restoring mana and mental strength.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King said that and drank it as if to demonstrate.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a strange feeling when I saw a reader who naturally finds material that the author did not write.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it leaves the hand of the writer, the story continues.</p>
「Does Han Sooyoung know about this?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Along with a faint headache, the dream I had seen before flashed through my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I looked around in a hurry, Killer King said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Jung Heewon is over here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Next to the bonfire, Jung Heewon was asleep under a light blanket. When I put my hand to the tip of her nose, I could feel her breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There doesn&#39;t seem to be any trauma, but I think it was a mental attack.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon still seems to have not recovered from the aftereffects of [Incite]. I briefly mentioned the situation instead of a detailed explanation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I met the Misreading Association.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, Killer King&#39;s attitude changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Tell me in detail.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I exhaled lightly and started talking about the gathering of readers under the theater dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Without even listening to a few words, Killer King quickly grasped the situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is it. The scenario has changed. Are they considerate of latecomers?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Especially after hearing that a guy who called himself &#39;the writer&#39; appeared, Killer King&#39;s eyes began to take on an eerie light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Author? You said he went with the Misreading Association guys?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know, but I wonder if Yoo Joonghyuk made that kind of expression when he was stabbed in the back by Anna Croft in the second round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Killer King quickly regained his composure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You don&#39;t know it, but [Lie Detection] can cheat by adjusting to the speaker&#39;s beliefs, or the value of the information being said.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s something I know, but I nodded my head once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;To say that he wrote the Book of Revelation himself... would mean that he wrote the &#39;illegal text&#39; in the Revelation. In other words, it means that he is not a &#39;real writer.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was amazed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;By the way, if it&#39;s a illegal text writer... Is he the one after all?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you know who it is?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It must be one of the executives of the Misreading Association. I have fought him before. How did it go? Are you sure he has stopped breathing?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He&#39;s probably dead. He was seriously injured.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King nodded his head approvingly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I roughly understood the situation. You managed to survive.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;When did you two come here?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Half a day outside. Based on this stage, it was two days ago.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps this stage had a different time scale than the outside.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it&#39;s half a day outside, did it come around the time the &#39;emergency defense battle&#39; started?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;With the two of you, it wouldn’t have been a movie that would have taken two days.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We also met the Misreading Association.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The Misreading Association?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I belatedly realized my mistake.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did I think the Misreading Association would only be among the “latecomers”?</p>
<p class="orv_line">They must have read the exhibition through the illegal text, so the quick-witted ones among them must have infiltrated the theater dungeon beforehand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The number is five in total. As soon as I entered the stage, I met them. Two were rats, and three were snakes. I killed them all, but the problem was that the snakes bit me as they died.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Saying that, Killer King showed his arm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were traces of a snake&#39;s teeth on his pale arms, and a purple mark was engraved around the teeth marks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s a curse.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What curse?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The Curse of Disorientation.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It reminded me of a setting I had memorized sometime.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A person with this curse is not only unable to judge the directions of the north, south, east and west, but also unconsciously takes the path of the wind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Fortunately, it&#39;s a curse with a statute of limitations, so it seems to be lifted by simply escaping from this stage.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I see. So two days... um? Wait a minute.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s strange when you think about it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King must have been the only one who was cursed?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don’t you have a younger sibling? Your younger sister should take the lead.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At my words, Killer King&#39;s sister made a startled face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King looked at her blankly and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yerin is usually long.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King&#39;s younger sister slept on Killer King&#39;s side as hard as she could.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King, who frowned slightly, said with a sinister smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Anyway, I have a favor to ask of you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;A favor?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Take us to the central research building. Then I&#39;ll spare your life.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King was once again kicked by his sister.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">It was fortunate to meet the Killer King siblings on this stage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King is a bit strange, but he was a reliable ally on the same side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think we&#39;d better start right away.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So far, since the curse effect is also bothering me, I think it would be better to move quickly, even to arrive a minute earlier.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said while drawing a simple map on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know the location of the research building.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Jung Heewon hasn&#39;t woken up yet.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely dangerous to carry Jung Heewon on his back. But there wasn&#39;t much time given.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;She&#39;ll wake up soon. I&#39;m gone and I&#39;ll move.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any ulterior motive. Being tricked by you once is enough.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, the last place I met this brother and sister was inside the Dark Edge.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You gave us a &#39;Random Item Box&#39; that had lost its effect at that time.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I answered honestly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It was.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you use the box?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shook my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, I thought he would use [Lie Detection], but I didn&#39;t hear the message.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After thinking for a while, Killer King asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why did you leave the note?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the time, I jotted down some useful information in the box I gave them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it&#39;s Killer King, you&#39;ve probably got quite a few hidden pieces that are good for that width by now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You really don&#39;t know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King glared at me for a moment, then turned his head away with a face that seemed to have hurt his pride.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No. I think I know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed to be so.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Killer King is curious, he is the type to find out on his own. Because he is such a person, he has read ORV 99.8 times. Ordinarily, I would have read a collection of ORV readings compiled by others.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;By the way, it&#39;s difficult to leave now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The roar of the earth dragons could be heard intermittently. Killer King continued,</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t know what you did, but the monsters are going crazy right now because of you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered the Misreading Association constellations that hindered me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Plague-Bringing Rat&#39; exited after being hit by a probabilistic aftermath, but one more constellation remained.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Snake Cutting off its Tail.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps he is the culprit behind this situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging from the fact that there is no particular setting that comes to mind, it must be a nameless constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that nameless constellation was a huge obstacle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There are two of them. I saw earlier that they are good at catching level 7 earth dragons.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It was a surprise attack, so it was easy to catch. If we fight head-on, it will take us longer. And…&quot;</p>
[All paper rolls on the stage are affected by the &#39;Black Moon&#39; effect.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King continued his words while glaring at the moon in the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since that moon rose, the power of the Earth Dragons has been getting stronger.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If I meet the 7th grade dragon again now, even if I ambushed it, it won’t be easy.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Fortunately, that &#39;black moon&#39; has a fixed duration.&quot;</p>
[The &#39;Black Moon&#39; effect lasts for a total of 8 hours.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was clear what Killer King meant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even when I thought with common sense, it&#39;s right to wait here. After Jung Heewon wakes up, it’ll be safe to move after the effect of the &#39;Black Moon&#39; is over.</p>
「That way, I won&#39;t lose anyone anymore.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I already lost Jung Jaewoo because of my misjudgment. If I make a mistake here, other readers… Killer King or Killer King&#39;s younger sister may die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I still have to go.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know it&#39;s not a realistic judgment. However, it is an impossible world to think realistically.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because where we are is fiction.</p>
「You have to think of it as novelistic in fiction.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Guilt can&#39;t keep you from doing important things.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo is dead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But he will be a little overseer and will be alive. Maybe other readers will too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They didn&#39;t die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And if he&#39;s not dead, there&#39;s a way to bring him back somehow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had to believe that now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was such a “story,” and I had to think of the next development in such a nonsensical world.</p>
「To prevent the planned destruction and pioneer a new story.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Will I be able to reach the right ending?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yoo Joonghyuk may die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King paused for a moment before asking again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is it true?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King did not use [Lie Detection]. Instead he looked at his sister.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yerin.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sister quietly shrugged her shoulders, as if to do whatever he wanted. Killer King&#39;s troubles were not long.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m going to the research building.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">We made our way through the broad-leaved forest and headed straight to the central research building.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We often encountered an 8th grade earth dragon raptor, and even more rarely a 7th grade earth dragon, Tyranno.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It took some time, but we steadily moved forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The direction was not wrong. According to my thoughts, the research center was definitely over here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King followed me without a word. He sometimes pruned branches in advance to be considerate of his sister, or warned her to watch her feet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be honest. It was a bit incomprehensible to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King heard only one word that Yoo Jonghyuk could die, and he was taking the risk with me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How could that be?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I have a question.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked Killer King, who broke off the protruding branches.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why is the name &#39;Seven Apostles&#39;? At least in ORV, &#39;apostle&#39; is not used in a very good sense.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the entire novel, the “apostles” did not read the revelation to the end, but it was a word precisely referring to their executives.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King glared at me for a moment as if asking me all that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought I could hear a sound, and then the leaves swayed one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The rain that had stopped for a while started to fall again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Could it be because of the sound of rain?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We are.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t immediately understand what he said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I haven&#39;t read the story to the end yet.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Understanding came a little late.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t even think of it. I thought it was the community name of readers who simply borrowed the name “Apostle,” but it wasn&#39;t.</p>
「The “7 Apostles” was a group of people who believed that the “Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint” was not over yet.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Since the novel was not over, they were defectors.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s why it&#39;s an apostle.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because they are involuntary defectors, they call themselves “apostles.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But the story...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It’s finished.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I was about to say that, something blocked my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were countless thoughts running through my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason I and the readers came to this world now. And an anecdote from Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint that is being serialized on my cell phone as it pleases.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In an instant, goosebumps went down my forearms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps, the reason why this world has no choice but to exist is...</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why are you asking that all of a sudden? Do you want to become an apostle too?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King was looking at me and asking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Even if I wanted to become it, I couldn’t accept it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Uh... Why?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then Killer King frowned his thick eyebrows and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You act like a guy who knows the end all by himself.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Without realizing it, I burst out laughing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Killer King&#39;s expression was serious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You knew a hidden piece that I didn&#39;t know about.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That....&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If it&#39;s special like now, you’ll smile with a strange expression.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s just because I have narrow eyes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King, ignoring my words, concluded his words by looking at my wounded shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;In addition to being used to pain. Do you have a [Fourth Wall]?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t know what to say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, such a temptation arose.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it would be okay to tell him that I am the writer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But soon I got a thought.</p>
「What&#39;s the use of saying that now?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Now that I am calling myself a writer, I am not responsible for anything about this story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe my expression was strange, Killer King added with a light smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#39;t take it seriously. It&#39;s just that I don&#39;t like you acting like Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The building of the central research building could be seen in the distance. We had finally come close to our destination.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I thought for a while that it would be nice.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King&#39;s expression, saying that, seemed somehow lonely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a moment about the other readers in the lobby of the theater. Maybe they&#39;re accepting the truth of the world by now, too.</p>
「There is no Kim Dokja in this world.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">They read Kim Dokja&#39;s story, and were curious about Kim Dokja&#39;s story, but they were summoned to this world without Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, for whom does this story exist?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Get ready soon.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The younger sister of Killer King and Killer King stopped walking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We all know that the real danger starts now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As you may know, if it was as it should be, the ending conditions should have been met when we hunted the 7th-level Earth Dragon.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was as Killer King said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the main part of the book, the ending message appeared at the moment of hunting “Tyranno,” but now it wasn’t the case.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It must mean the ending of this movie is not like that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Coo coo coo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Right in front of the road leading to the central research building, something was waiting for.</p>
[The owner of the theater is looking forward to the ending you will make.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A cry rang low as if scratching the ground. The ground around us began to shake violently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The expression of Killer King and Killer King&#39;s younger sister hardened. Looking at the faces of the two people with a faint fear spreading, I felt an inexplicable sense of excitement.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this how I feel because I am a writer?</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is a guy stronger than 7th grade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Or is it because I, too, am a first-time reader of this story?</p>
[Grade 6 Earth Dragon, &#39;Cretaceous owner&#39;, roars!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I thought maybe this theater might have the answer.</p>
