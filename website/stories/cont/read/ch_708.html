            <div class="orv_title"><h1>708 Episode 26 Star Ladder (4)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">One day after 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' was completed, there was a time when Ji Eunyu was collecting comment questions for a questionnaire survey.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Among them, one question was noticeably overlapping.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How strong is Kim Dokja?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Saesang, I was curious too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How strong is Kim Dokja?</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I actually tried to write the answer, I couldn't figure out how strong Kim Dokja was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because the standard of strength in 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is 'stories'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja accumulated stories through indiscriminate efforts, and the more stories he accumulated, the stronger he became.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In Part 1, five stories were collected to become the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In Part 2, he obtained his first 'Giant Story' by defeating 'Surya', the supreme god of light, a mythical-grade constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In Part 3, he got the second big story after the 1,863rd round and ‘Gigantomachia’.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In Part 4, he became the youngest member of 'Jecheon Daeseong', which became complete after the Holy Demon Battle, and completed the rest of the 'Giant Story'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja, who finally reached Part 5, became this world itself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What does it mean to become a world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it possible to measure the 'strength' of the being that has become the world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even now, I don’t know the answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, I have something to say about 'Kim Dokja before he became the world'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, Kim Dokja in 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint Part 1'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja became a narrative level constellation and earned the title 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If someone asks, this is how I would describe his strength.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Well, wouldn’t it be possible to wipe out about ten great-grade people?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And unfortunately, the constellation in front of me did not hear my answer.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I’ve never heard of a story like this—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnation of the 'cleaner' who was muttering in disbelief slowly separated into upper and lower parts.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'The One Who Washes Clean' has suffered a terrible blow to his true body!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation' The One Who Washes Clean' leaves the scenario!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnation body, freed from half-body descent, crumbled into white bones, and the exit messages of the other two constellations that had suffered the same thing rang out one after another.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Survivor of a Secret Country' exits the scenario!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'The Wise Young Man' leaves the scenario!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A tragedy that occurred in an instant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations were speechless.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The power of the constellation cannot be used in the form of Half-God Advent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But even so, constellations are constellations, beings that are recognized as such by gathering as many as five stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">These were never great people who would suffer in vain like this.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Valkyrie's daughter. How did that happen?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[How on earth did that guy—]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Everyone, don’t panic. That level is far below his original status.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A lot lower? Just how strong was that constellation—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'Valkyrie’s Daughter' answered with a cold expression.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The final classification grade of the constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' was 'Myth Grade'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A mythical constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At those words, the seven constellations opened their mouths at each other at the same time.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Mythical level? Aren’t you misunderstanding something?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Why didn’t you inform me of that fact sooner!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja said, as if he was enjoying the commotion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You seem to know something. Those poor great-grade seem to have come without knowing anything."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations now looked as if they were about to scream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But in fact, Kim Dokja was not in a situation to relax that much. I knew more than anyone else because I was the one who lent him my body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Crumble.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though I was not receiving any probability aftermath, my body was already tearing in various places.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An incarnation that was destroyed by just one [constellation].</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is the 'class' of a mythical-level constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Constellation-nim.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now, there is a limit to the number of [full-personalization] that can be done with this body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">On the other hand, there are seven remaining great-grade constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, Kim Dokja did not lose his composure .</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you die here, no record will be left behind. Are you all ready to disappear cleanly?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it would be better if they got scared and ran away like this, but there was no way the situation would be resolved that easily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Valkyrie’s Daughter' stepped forward and spoke.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellations of the great &lt;Asgard&gt;. There's no need to be scared. 'Mythical grade' is just a story from another world line. Now he is just a fragment of a discarded god.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A discarded god. They used that expression before too.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[His true body has already been cruelly torn apart by the great 'mythical constellations'. He cannot use the power he had in his prime. Just like the monkey star in &lt;The Emperor&gt;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I was a little embarrassed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What is that kid talking about now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja's 'true body' is torn?</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the one who did that was a mythical constellation?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it possible?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't understand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Based on the completion of Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint, Kim Dokja has a status that goes beyond a mythical constellation and can be called the absolute ruler of this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did Kim Dokja suffer like that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Are other mythical constellations that strong?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of the mythical constellations representing each nebula.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, the constellations of the 'last scenario' such as Odin, the 'One-Eyed Matreya' in &lt;Asgard&gt;, or the 'Seat of Lightning' in &lt;Olympus&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja in the main story also chose to avoid them rather than confront them head on, so their strength was clearly proven.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that was all before Kim Dokja became the 'Oldest Dream'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will Odin or Zeus be strong enough to deal with Kim Dokja after seeing the end of the scenario?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Arrogant fragment of god. You are no longer the only observer in this world.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What is clear is that 'Valkyrie’s daughter' in front of us knows who the 'Demon King of Salvation' is.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I'm sure you're still under the illusion that you can see and shape this world at will.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And that he knows something about the secrets of this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Constellation-nim, what does that mean? What does it mean that your body was torn?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered what would happen if he avoided answering, but Kim Dokja answered obediently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Literally. You already know. There is not just one 'Kim Dokja' in this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Then what about the 'Oldest Dream'?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to what they said, there was a high probability that the 'Oldest Dream' did not exist in this world today.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I thought about it that way, there were some things that immediately made sense.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "You can only press the reset button once. In the next round, everything in this universe will be destroyed forever." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In a flashback seen through Anna Croft, Yoo Jonghyuk of the 40th round said: the 41st round is his last life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Yoo Jonghyuk found out that there was a problem with his sponsor, and that caused a problem with his [regression], then it was understandable that he said that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, if the 'Oldest Dream' had truly disappeared, the real problem was different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Who on earth is observing this world right now?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">The entire universe exists through Kim Dokja's observations, which became the 'Oldest Dream'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But if the 'Oldest Dream' is absent, who will watch over this world on his behalf?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Youngest, you probably have a lot of questions right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as Kim Dokja was about to reply to my words, the constellations that gained courage once again surrounded us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja opened his mouth with a bitter smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you want to keep fighting? Even if I can’t show the strength I had in my prime, it’s easy to rip you to death."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Maybe so. That is, if your incarnation body was fine.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'Valkyrie's Daughter', who had suddenly changed her speaking style to an honorific one, smiled subtly and her bright eyes shone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Stigmata "sharp eyes".</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although it is impossible to find out detailed information about the other person like with [Character List] or [Sage's Eyes], it is a technique to analyze the other person's current state through close observation of the other person's breathing, movement, tone of voice, or facial expression.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Even if you have that much power, your incarnation body is already limited. Do you think I don’t know?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Indeed, weren’t there not only stupid constellations in &lt;Asgard&gt;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">After doing a complete analysis of our situation, Valkyrie's daughter gave orders to the other constellations.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Please gather y	our strength. I will deal with him directly.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'Valkyrie’s Daughter' stood at the front representing the remaining constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Eventually, the constellations continued, and the status of the seven constellations was concentrated on a single constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The aura of 'Valkyrie's Daughter’, which had been fluttering red and blue, soon began to burn fiercely with pure white light.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 This place is now a yawning abyss. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The spear she held in her hand burned fiercely, and a string of story stirred.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The worlds of ice and fire were divided across the primordial void. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I read that line, I was depressed. Although it was a short sentence and not a full sentence, there was no mistake.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Isn't that the crest of creation?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">I never thought it would come this far in &lt;Asgard&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fact that they gave the Creation Crest to a constellation that was only great-grade means that they are that serious about this situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I got caught by crazy people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja also seemed troubled this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In any case, from a Nebula’s point of view, great-grade constellations are expendable. If only they could capture Kim Dokja by handing over the Creation Crest to them, it was a reasonable enough expense for &lt;Asgard&gt;.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Well, try using that technique one more time.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Now, that skill can only be used once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My body has reached its limit, and now 'Valkyrie’s Daughter' risks her life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I defeat her, the remaining six constellations will unite against us at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If that happens, it's over.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Don’t worry, youngest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, even in the face of an imminent situation, Kim Dokja remained calm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja took a deep breath and shouted in an even louder voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don’t understand what you’re saying. You guys can’t do it. Why don’t you just call stronger constellations?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[We are enough for you—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Even if you say that the mythical-grade constellations are lazy, what are all the mythical-grade constellations doing? Don’t you guys have any of the 12 Olympus-grade constellations? Is this the only Asgardian foot?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, there is a grade of '12 Olympus' in &lt;Asgard&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Guardian of the Great Horn Bridge! Flame of Muspelheim! God of Harp and Horon! Where are you all hiding?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the narrative-grade constellations' descriptions flowed from Kim Dokja's mouth, the constellations, including 'Valkyrie's Daughter', were startled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja continued as if enjoying their reactions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heimdall! Surtur! Tyr! Baldur! Where are you all hiding so you can’t see me? I’m here! Come get me!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations, who belatedly noticed the situation, shouted in anxious voices.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[How dare you—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I was equally anxious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They say we're crazy, so we act like we’re crazy too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">​So what are we going to do?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If a really angry Heimdall or Surtur shows up...</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then suddenly a strange thought crossed my mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Those bastards, really, why didn’t anyone come?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;Asgard&gt; paid a great deal of probability for this event, to the extent of bringing 'Ginnungagap' to the stage. Why didn't they bring in the crucial constellations when they were even given the Crest of Creation?</p>
<p class="orv_line">To put it bluntly, if a constellation like Odin, the 'One-Eyed Father', a mythical constellation, or Thor, the 'Thunder of Thursday', had come from the beginning, we would have been reduced to ashes on the spot.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fact that they couldn't do that....</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Coward Odin! If you want to catch me, come and see for yourself!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as Odin's name came out of Kim Dokja's mouth, the constellations of Asgard turned pale.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[No—!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Normally, lightning should have fallen from the sky by now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The world was dead quiet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja looked up at the sky for a moment and spoke as if laughing at the silence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It must be scary. The scale is tipping."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as he said those words, the sky tore apart and a ray of lightning struck.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Grumble!</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was lightning from &lt;Asgard&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The high-ranking constellations of &lt;Asgard&gt;, who had been silent throughout, eventually responded to Kim Dokja's provocation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But at that very moment, the sound of something being torn apart was heard from across the sky struck by lightning. A terrible roar sounded as if the stars were being erased, and the sky became quiet again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The great-grade constellations looked up at the scene with wide eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[W-what on earth—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was clear what had happened. One of the constellations of &lt;Asgard&gt; beyond 'Ginnongagap' caused an uproar, and almost at the same time, someone struck a fatal blow to that constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But who on earth could do such a thing?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who can bring down a constellation of &lt;Asgard&gt;, which no constellation in this universe can touch?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If the scales tip, someone you can’t handle may come to you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja looked up at the sky with a distant gaze. I looked up at the sky with him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the pitch-black sky of Ginnungagap rippled like a black coat, I also realized something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know who the 'Oldest Dream' that observes this world is.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, I knew one person who was looking for Kim Dokja more than anyone else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is a being who is not afraid to face Nebulae.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The one who killed the most 'stars' in all of the universe and saw the end of the scenarios with Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The protagonist of 'Ways of Survival',</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Beyond that curtain is the 'Yoo Jonghyuk' I knew. 」</p></div>
