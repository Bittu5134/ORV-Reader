Please refrain from changing chapters’ format i.e. font, letter size, color, background, etc… If you really need to, please open a separate copy.Noh Gyeonghwan moved forward one step at a time. Since he couldn&#39;t see in front of him, the world&#39;s scenery was complete darkness.</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Noh Gyeonghwan muttered as he stretched deeper into the darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What is the scene like now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He didn&#39;t ask expecting an answer. But someone answered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It’s a flower arrangement, ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound was so distant that he couldn&#39;t tell who it belonged to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Noh Gyeonghwan heard that voice and imagined an invisible landscape. Then, one by one, flowers bloomed in the darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Red marigolds blooming everywhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the flower that would kill him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Noh Gyeonghwan said:</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Noh Gyeonghwan thought about his wife who died after being hit by a meteorite.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He thinks about his wife who died in the flower garden and he dies.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If his life were a novel, wouldn&#39;t this be the place where his last sentence would be written?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Noh Gyeonghwan recalled his daughter’s favorite novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He wishes this was also a story. He hopes someday his daughter reads this story and laughs. He wishes he could say something like that to his daughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">See, this dad also appears in your favorite novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Noh Gyeonghwan smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jiyoon was probably dead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He would have died in this life, just like his wife did.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He thought about his daughter&#39;s last days.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How painful was it? How lonely she must have been.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Noh Gyeonghwan gathered his strength once again and took his steps. Now he will soon be able to meet his wife and daughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To do so, he must end the story of Lee Dansu, not the human Noh Gyeonghwan.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;I am Lee Dansu.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The name he received in the new world. What kind of life did the original owner of this body live?</p>
<p class="orv_line">He does not know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, his body was now at its limits and his consciousness continued to blur. It must be because too much blood was shed.</p>
[The power of the star gem strengthens your body!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If there weren&#39;t one star gem left, it wouldn&#39;t have been surprising if he didn’t collapse right away in this state.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of the Lesser Dragon&#39;s breathing was getting closer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A dizzying flowery scent reached the tip of his nose.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansu finally remembered the name of one man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Inho-ssi, I&#39;m sorry.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">And that moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The voice became clearer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I see you can hear me now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The voice that said earlier that this place was a flower garden. Lee Dansu knew the owner of that voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I answered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Yes, it’s me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansu looked around even though he knew he was blind. The man’s voice was trembling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How did you wake up? You shouldn&#39;t be here. If you don&#39;t get back on the scaffolding-&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I am safe. The important thing now is you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m done now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The voice of someone who has already let go of life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansu&#39;s eyes were blind, and every part of his body was necrotic. The muscles in his limbs fell into clumps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the reason he wants to give up on life may not be because of his crippled body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why is the world killing my family?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t know what to say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What would Yoo Jonghyuk have said?</p>
「&quot;As soon as the scenario begins, there is a dead boy. Are you more unhappy? Or is the boy more unfortunate? What is the meaning of fighting over misfortune in this world?&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What would Han Sooyoung say?</p>
「&quot;All misfortunes are ordinary. It looks special because it was captured in a story.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But I couldn&#39;t talk like them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Those words weren&#39;t what he needed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t want to live anymore.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason I want Lee Dansu to live longer here is probably just my greed for liking him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know. Even if he survives here, his misfortune will not go away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He will have to endure life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He will have to live in a world without his wife and daughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What does it mean to him? Can I make that meaning? How dare I do something like that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though I was thinking about that, I couldn&#39;t suppress this greed.</p>
「I want to write a novel.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Sitting in an unknown theater, I wanted to show the next story to readers who, like me, were hoping that the man would survive. I started writing sentences.</p>
「What kind of person was my father?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansu trembled with excitement and looked up into empty space.</p>
「My mom died after being hit by a meteorite and my dad got cancer.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The man&#39;s lips closing again and again.</p>
「Are we a cursed family?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even a man who can&#39;t see anything will hear that sentence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who just said that…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The uncle stuttered in disbelief and then he asked:</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is it Jiyoon?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Yes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Jiyoon, is she alive?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hesitated to answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I answer honestly, the truth will take away his last hope.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But if I tell a lie, is it a lie that can be forgiven?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I blinked slowly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And I thought about a person&#39;s heart, not about truth or lies.</p>
「&quot;Please save my father, Kim Dokja.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A daughter&#39;s wish for her father to survive. I thought of a sentence that would represent that feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Yes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This world is the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A world created by the author, readers, and protagonist together.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A world where it is possible for dead people to come back to life, to go against time, and to be reborn as a different person.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At least in this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">-Yes, she is alive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is not a lie.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—For that to happen, you must survive first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Spores were spreading rapidly in the air. It will now take less than 30 seconds for spores to cover the entire area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;B-but how…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The voice of an impatient man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I possessed the man&#39;s body as if I would jump into the ocean behind him if I calmly took a breath.</p>
[Stage 3 of &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint&#39; is strongly activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The man’s eyes shone brightly. In the place where his eyes disappeared, pupils formed from clusters of light appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I can see it!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Run!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi and I ran to avoid the spores. I continued running, being careful not to step on the flower buds on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Coat!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man picked up the coat that had fallen on the floor. It was my white coat that fell off while dodging the attack of the poisonous species earlier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—There’s a brown bottle in my inner pocket!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man immediately found the item I mentioned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sidok Kobulo&#39;s Horn Powder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A consumable item with a poison neutralizing effect.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Spores ahead! Dodge to the right! Pick up a book next to it!</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was something that looked like a small booklet rolling around on the floor where I pointed. It was an item dropped by the men of the king who died earlier.</p>
[Item &#39;Donguibogam Miscellaneous Soldiers&#39; was acquired.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The groups gathered here are probably the ones who cleared the 5-person dungeon &#39;Donguibogam’s Field&#39;.</p>
[Item &#39;Donguibogam Bedding&#39; was acquired.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A total of 9 books by Donguibogam fell on the floor.</p>
[Item &#39;Donguibogam&#39;. The effect of &#39;incomplete version&#39; is in effect.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And Donguibogam is an item that activates the poison ability when you collect more than 8 pieces.</p>
[Your body temporarily develops its own poisoning ability.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel the man&#39;s breathing getting easier. But this is nothing more than buying time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if &#39;Sideuk Kobulo&#39;s Horn Powder&#39; and &#39;Donguibogam&#39; create synergy, not even 30 trillion will be able to be produced in these spores.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man&#39;s body was turning brown after being touched by the spores.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Grrrr…</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, the dragon, who sensed something unusual, also looked this way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An additional phase is triggered when the man does not die despite its attack.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The poisonous dragon species let out a harsh cry into the air and let out its breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey, Inho-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man&#39;s complexion turned pale as he watched his breath fall like acid rain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I reassured the man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It&#39;s okay. Run, hurry!</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Can I continue living?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—We must meet Jiyoon again!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man gasped without answering. That short silence was telling me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi already knows everything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Even if I survive, I will continue to be a burden to Inho-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A burden. Lee Dansu thought of himself that way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King looked at him with [eyes of sin].</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is said that Lee Dansu had a pure white soul, as if he were wearing a white coat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could read the footsteps of the pure white soul.</p>
「&quot;Could you please tell me how to catch bugs?&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A person who has completed &#39;Proof of Worth&#39; by killing bugs on the subway.</p>
「&quot;Do you really have to kill others?&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansu, alone, defended his beliefs in a scenario where everyone was killing each other.</p>
「&quot;I won’t kill you. I won’t kill you.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A person who ate the &#39;star jewel&#39; and became a monster, but did not kill anyone in the end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—None of us lived like you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this world, one person&#39;s life soon becomes a story.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Demon-like Judge of Fire&#39; looks at incarnation &#39;Lee Dansu&#39;.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Prisoner of the Golden Headband&#39; watches incarnation &#39;Lee Dansu&#39;.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Maritime War God&#39; supports the history of incarnation &#39;Lee Dansu&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, in order to prove the story, a &#39;qualification&#39; is needed.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Sneaky Schemer&#39; nods.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A &#39;qualification&#39; to prove that ahjussi’s story is worth recording.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That qualification was rolling around on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Run! Pick it up! Hurry!</p>
<p class="orv_line">With my shout, the man picked up the &#39;brown flag&#39; that had fallen on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A soft light shone all over Lee Dansu’s whole body.</p>
[Incarnation &#39;Lee Dansu&#39; took the &#39;brown flag&#39;.]</p></div>
[The King&#39;s Road begins!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Acidic liquid fell from the air and poured down on the man&#39;s head. An attack that cannot be neutralized even with &#39;Donguibogam&#39; or &#39;Sideuk Kobulo&#39;s Horn Powder&#39;.</p>
[The shield is activated by the effect of the &#39;brown flag&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A shield stretched out in the air blocked the acid breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly looked around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A total of eight flags fell to the ground. They were all dropped by dead kings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order to complete &#39;King’s Path&#39; in this world line, we must achieve the &#39;Black Flag&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Pick it all up!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Every time a new flag is picked up, the color of the man&#39;s flag starts to change.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dark brown, heat purple, purple, dark purple, and-</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man&#39;s body, caught on a stone, rolled on the floor. The sound of a flower bud bursting as it is crushed. The thick spores began to stick to the man&#39;s entire body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Flowers grew on the man&#39;s skin. The wildflowers were blooming continuously, giving off a strong scent. The man’s magic began to disappear rapidly.</p>
[Incarnation &#39;Lee Dansu&#39; achieved the &#39;Black Flag&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of breathing coming slowly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel the man’s fear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now even ahjussi knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What will happen from now on?</p>
<p class="orv_line">And what was my plan?</p>
[The key conditions for &#39;The King’s Road&#39; are unlocked.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know whether this operation will succeed or not.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man covered in red petals smiled as if he knew how I felt.</p>
「This is a path that only Lee Dansu can take in this world. And for this method to succeed, ahjussi must die once.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know what that is. Maybe I don&#39;t even want to know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is that something that can be &#39;experienced&#39;? What happens after you go through that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Ahjussi, don’t worry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No one knows that except Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I will be with you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We will soon find out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Friend.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With the man&#39;s last words, my vision darkened completely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A pitch-black void has arrived. A phrase with nothing written in it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I called ahjussi over and over again. But Lee Dansu had no answer.</p>
[Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint has an abnormal reaction!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Am I alive now or am I dead?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it&#39;s none of the two.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Am I just looking at a huge wall?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I fumbled along the endless wall, searching like a madman for print that I could read.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the next moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Black. With that feeling, the darkness sucked me in. The surroundings became brighter. I was in the labyrinth again.</p>
[A new king was born.]</p></div>
[You made a decisive contribution to the birth of a new king.]</p></div>
[The &lt;Star Stream&gt; reassesses your story.]</p></div>
[A new &#39;loss&#39; is recorded on the &#39;Final Wall&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A dazzling light was shining through the fluttering red flower petals.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Inside, the body of Lee Dansu was being reconstructed.</p>
「Now, it was the moment when a new &#39;King of No Killing&#39; was born.」</p></div>
