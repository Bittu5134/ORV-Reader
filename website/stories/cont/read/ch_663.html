<p class="orv_line">Noh Gyeonghwan moved forward one step at a time. Since he couldn't see in front of him, the world's scenery was complete darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Noh Gyeonghwan muttered as he stretched deeper into the darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What is the scene like now?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">He didn't ask expecting an answer. But someone answered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It’s a flower arrangement, ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound was so distant that he couldn't tell who it belonged to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Noh Gyeonghwan heard that voice and imagined an invisible landscape. Then, one by one, flowers bloomed in the darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Red marigolds blooming everywhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the flower that would kill him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Noh Gyeonghwan said:</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s beautiful."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Noh Gyeonghwan thought about his wife who died after being hit by a meteorite.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He thinks about his wife who died in the flower garden and he dies.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If his life were a novel, wouldn't this be the place where his last sentence would be written?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Noh Gyeonghwan recalled his daughter’s favorite novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He wishes this was also a story. He hopes someday his daughter reads this story and laughs. He wishes he could say something like that to his daughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">See, this dad also appears in your favorite novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Noh Gyeonghwan smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jiyoon was probably dead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He would have died in this life, just like his wife did.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He thought about his daughter's last days.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How painful was it? How lonely she must have been.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Noh Gyeonghwan gathered his strength once again and took his steps. Now he will soon be able to meet his wife and daughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To do so, he must end the story of Lee Dansu, not the human Noh Gyeonghwan.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I am Lee Dansu.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">The name he received in the new world. What kind of life did the original owner of this body live?</p>
<p class="orv_line">He does not know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, his body was now at its limits and his consciousness continued to blur. It must be because too much blood was shed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The power of the star gem strengthens your body!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If there weren't one star gem left, it wouldn't have been surprising if he didn’t collapse right away in this state.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of the Lesser Dragon's breathing was getting closer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A dizzying flowery scent reached the tip of his nose.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansu finally remembered the name of one man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Inho-ssi, I'm sorry.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">And that moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The voice became clearer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I see you can hear me now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The voice that said earlier that this place was a flower garden. Lee Dansu knew the owner of that voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I answered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Yes, it’s me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansu looked around even though he knew he was blind. The man’s voice was trembling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How did you wake up? You shouldn't be here. If you don't get back on the scaffolding-"</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I am safe. The important thing now is you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m done now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The voice of someone who has already let go of life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansu's eyes were blind, and every part of his body was necrotic. The muscles in his limbs fell into clumps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the reason he wants to give up on life may not be because of his crippled body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why is the world killing my family?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't know what to say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What would Yoo Jonghyuk have said?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "As soon as the scenario begins, there is a dead boy. Are you more unhappy? Or is the boy more unfortunate? What is the meaning of fighting over misfortune in this world?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What would Han Sooyoung say?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "All misfortunes are ordinary. It looks special because it was captured in a story." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But I couldn't talk like them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Those words weren't what he needed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don’t want to live anymore."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason I want Lee Dansu to live longer here is probably just my greed for liking him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know. Even if he survives here, his misfortune will not go away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He will have to endure life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He will have to live in a world without his wife and daughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What does it mean to him? Can I make that meaning? How dare I do something like that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though I was thinking about that, I couldn't suppress this greed.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I want to write a novel. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Sitting in an unknown theater, I wanted to show the next story to readers who, like me, were hoping that the man would survive. I started writing sentences.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 What kind of person was my father? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansu trembled with excitement and looked up into empty space.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 My mom died after being hit by a meteorite and my dad got cancer. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The man's lips closing again and again.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Are we a cursed family? 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even a man who can't see anything will hear that sentence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who just said that…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The uncle stuttered in disbelief and then he asked:</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is it Jiyoon?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Yes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Jiyoon, is she alive?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hesitated to answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I answer honestly, the truth will take away his last hope.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But if I tell a lie, is it a lie that can be forgiven?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I blinked slowly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And I thought about a person's heart, not about truth or lies.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Please save my father, Kim Dokja." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A daughter's wish for her father to survive. I thought of a sentence that would represent that feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Yes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This world is the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A world created by the author, readers, and protagonist together.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A world where it is possible for dead people to come back to life, to go against time, and to be reborn as a different person.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At least in this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">-Yes, she is alive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is not a lie.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—For that to happen, you must survive first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Spores were spreading rapidly in the air. It will now take less than 30 seconds for spores to cover the entire area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"B-but how…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The voice of an impatient man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I possessed the man's body as if I would jump into the ocean behind him if I calmly took a breath.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Stage 3 of 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' is strongly activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The man’s eyes shone brightly. In the place where his eyes disappeared, pupils formed from clusters of light appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I can see it!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Run!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi and I ran to avoid the spores. I continued running, being careful not to step on the flower buds on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Coat!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man picked up the coat that had fallen on the floor. It was my white coat that fell off while dodging the attack of the poisonous species earlier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—There’s a brown bottle in my inner pocket!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man immediately found the item I mentioned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sidok Kobulo's Horn Powder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A consumable item with a poison neutralizing effect.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Spores ahead! Dodge to the right! Pick up a book next to it!</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was something that looked like a small booklet rolling around on the floor where I pointed. It was an item dropped by the men of the king who died earlier.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Item 'Donguibogam Miscellaneous Soldiers' was acquired.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The groups gathered here are probably the ones who cleared the 5-person dungeon 'Donguibogam’s Field'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Item 'Donguibogam Bedding' was acquired.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A total of 9 books by Donguibogam fell on the floor.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Item 'Donguibogam'. The effect of 'incomplete version' is in effect.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And Donguibogam is an item that activates the poison ability when you collect more than 8 pieces.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your body temporarily develops its own poisoning ability.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel the man's breathing getting easier. But this is nothing more than buying time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if 'Sideuk Kobulo's Horn Powder' and 'Donguibogam' create synergy, not even 30 trillion will be able to be produced in these spores.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man's body was turning brown after being touched by the spores.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Grrrr…</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, the dragon, who sensed something unusual, also looked this way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An additional phase is triggered when the man does not die despite its attack.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The poisonous dragon species let out a harsh cry into the air and let out its breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey, Inho-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man's complexion turned pale as he watched his breath fall like acid rain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I reassured the man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It's okay. Run, hurry!</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Can I continue living?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">—We must meet Jiyoon again!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man gasped without answering. That short silence was telling me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi already knows everything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even if I survive, I will continue to be a burden to Inho-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A burden. Lee Dansu thought of himself that way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King looked at him with [eyes of sin].</p>
<p class="orv_line">It is said that Lee Dansu had a pure white soul, as if he were wearing a white coat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could read the footsteps of the pure white soul.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Could you please tell me how to catch bugs?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A person who has completed 'Proof of Worth' by killing bugs on the subway.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Do you really have to kill others?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansu, alone, defended his beliefs in a scenario where everyone was killing each other.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I won’t kill you. I won’t kill you." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A person who ate the 'star jewel' and became a monster, but did not kill anyone in the end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—None of us lived like you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this world, one person's life soon becomes a story.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' looks at incarnation 'Lee Dansu'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' watches incarnation 'Lee Dansu'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' supports the history of incarnation 'Lee Dansu'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, in order to prove the story, a 'qualification' is needed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaky Schemer' nods.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A 'qualification' to prove that ahjussi’s story is worth recording.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That qualification was rolling around on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Run! Pick it up! Hurry!</p>
<p class="orv_line">With my shout, the man picked up the 'brown flag' that had fallen on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A soft light shone all over Lee Dansu’s whole body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation 'Lee Dansu' took the 'brown flag'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The King's Road begins!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Acidic liquid fell from the air and poured down on the man's head. An attack that cannot be neutralized even with 'Donguibogam' or 'Sideuk Kobulo's Horn Powder'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The shield is activated by the effect of the 'brown flag'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A shield stretched out in the air blocked the acid breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly looked around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A total of eight flags fell to the ground. They were all dropped by dead kings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order to complete 'King’s Path' in this world line, we must achieve the 'Black Flag'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Pick it all up!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Every time a new flag is picked up, the color of the man's flag starts to change.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dark brown, heat purple, purple, dark purple, and-</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man's body, caught on a stone, rolled on the floor. The sound of a flower bud bursting as it is crushed. The thick spores began to stick to the man's entire body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Flowers grew on the man's skin. The wildflowers were blooming continuously, giving off a strong scent. The man’s magic began to disappear rapidly.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation 'Lee Dansu' achieved the 'Black Flag'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of breathing coming slowly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel the man’s fear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now even ahjussi knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What will happen from now on?</p>
<p class="orv_line">And what was my plan?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The key conditions for 'The King’s Road' are unlocked.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know whether this operation will succeed or not.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man covered in red petals smiled as if he knew how I felt.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 This is a path that only Lee Dansu can take in this world. And for this method to succeed, ahjussi must die once. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know what that is. Maybe I don't even want to know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is that something that can be 'experienced'? What happens after you go through that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Ahjussi, don’t worry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No one knows that except Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I will be with you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We will soon find out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Friend."</p>
<p class="orv_line">With the man's last words, my vision darkened completely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A pitch-black void has arrived. A phrase with nothing written in it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I called ahjussi over and over again. But Lee Dansu had no answer.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint has an abnormal reaction!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Am I alive now or am I dead?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it's none of the two.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Am I just looking at a huge wall?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I fumbled along the endless wall, searching like a madman for print that I could read.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the next moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Black. With that feeling, the darkness sucked me in. The surroundings became brighter. I was in the labyrinth again.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new king was born.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You made a decisive contribution to the birth of a new king.]</p></div>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new 'loss' is recorded on the 'Final Wall'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A dazzling light was shining through the fluttering red flower petals.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Inside, the body of Lee Dansu was being reconstructed.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Now, it was the moment when a new 'King of No Killing' was born. 」</p></div>
