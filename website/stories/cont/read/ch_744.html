<p class="orv_line">The possibility of a nebula.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I read the message over and over again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart was beating deeply. Even though there is no incarnation that has become a constellation yet, there is a &#39;possibility of a nebula&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps this is also the influence of the newly developed story?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The voices of the group rejoicing were heard from afar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They say a new story is sprouting?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This can’t be—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It was worth including a panda every time I repaired a story fragment.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is it really because of that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is a story that neither I nor Han Sooyoung can write.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a story that was not found in &#39;Ways of Survival&#39; or &#39;Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint&#39; and could only be created by those who read it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story was now slowly sprouting before our eyes.</p>
「People who wanted to see the story of a very &#39;big house&#39;.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt certain that it was fate.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someday I will transcribe their stories. The emotions and scenery of this moment will be sketched out in crude sentences.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I held on to &#39;Unbreakable Faith&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yoo Jonghyuk, please protect the brick house.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">For the story that will be written someday, I must hold the sword now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We must protect this moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I slowly blinked, the sound disappeared from my ears. Instead, all I could hear was the sound of stories talking.</p>
[Exclusive attribute effect activates!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Some stories were familiar and some were unfamiliar. There were disturbing stories, and there were also sad stories.</p>
「I hate pandas」</p></div>
「I want to be like a panda too」</p></div>
「All you have to do is defeat the southern guys and steal their stories.」</p></div>
「Actually, I don’t want to do that.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And there was a story floating around about bears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A story that incites the bears’ desires.</p>
[Story fragment &#39;Fanning&#39; continues its storytelling.]</p></div>
「Fanning.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was the identity of the story fragment that moved the bear beastmen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone must have used this story fragment to fuel the bears&#39; desire and lead them here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked closely at the way the fragments of the story had been spread.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While the constellation &#39;A bear that saves Ones life if Onepretends to be dead&#39; and other bear beastmen are all affected by this &#39;story fragment&#39;—</p>
「There was one bear that was unaffected by this &#39;story fragment&#39;.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment our eyes met, he turned his back to me and started running away.</p>
[The item &#39;Sylphid’s Leap Boots&#39; activates!]</p></div>
[The item’s performance is halved due to the scenario effect.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s halved.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Abyssal Black Flame Dragon&#39; opens its eyes!]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Reclining Dragon&#39; admires your judgment!]</p></div>

<p class="orv_line">Without hesitation, I swung my &#39;Unbreakable Faith&#39; at him. With a popping sound, the bear&#39;s appearance changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a &#39;rat&#39; the size of a small child.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39; is looking at you!]</p></div>
「The zodiac.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely true.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is a &#39;rat&#39;, one of the Chinese zodiac animals, belonging to the &#39;characters&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tensed and held the hilt of the sword tightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If that is really the &lt;Zodiac&gt;, it must be a constellation of at least great-grade level.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;bear that will come back to life if you pretend to be dead&#39; that was talking in the vacant lot was also a constellation, but it was not of the level of a proper great-grade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the &lt;Zodiac&gt; is different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A proper &#39;great-grade constellation&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a difficult opponent for me now. All kinds of thoughts flowed quickly through my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I expected that the &lt;Zodiac&gt; was related to this matter, but I had no idea that the constellations from the &lt;Zodiac&gt; would be there in person.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Should I run away?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Or should I give it my all and give it a shot before it shows its true power?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What if we use stories?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What if we use Kim Dokja’s story from 「Heir of the Eternal Name」?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Or-</p>
[Now, wait a minute—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Unexpectedly, it was the rat who spoke first.</p>
[Don’t hurt me! I didn&#39;t come to fight!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something was strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The use of mantras and indirect messages, as well as the sensations felt, were clearly from a constellation. But the constellation barely has this level of status?</p>
[I was just watching! I’m curious about what kind of guys you are—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If you think about it, it was strange that a proper constellation appeared with its incarnation in tow, but there was no repercussions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is the eighth scenario area. If a &#39;great-grade constellation&#39; had unleashed its true power, the scenario should have exploded a long time ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there were no signs of a probability aftermath in the surrounding area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don’t lie.&quot;</p>
[It-it’s true!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After buying some time by saying something, I observed the guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnation of the &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39; is a small, small rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much I tried to sharpen my senses, I could barely feel any fighting power. At this level, it was safe to say that it was almost below a symbolic body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What is his purpose? Why on earth did he appear here in such an incarnation?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I narrowed my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The scream of a brown bear was heard behind me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, the group began to herd the bears. I said, looking back at the bodies of the dead bears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That’s what you guys did. You used story fragments to control the bears. Are you going to act like a fool?&quot;</p>
[Well, that might be so! But I didn&#39;t order it! I swear!]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39; shouts that it is real!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A strangely fearful &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glared at that guy and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You didn’t do it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39; nodded enthusiastically.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then why were you here?&quot;</p>
[I told you earlier! I just want to see you in person—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Say it straight.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I took a step closer and aimed with &#39;Unbreakable Faith&#39;, the &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39; made a &#39;hissing&#39; sound and quickly continued speaking.</p>
[Yes, actually, I came to ask for an alliance. You guys are also going up to the next &#39;floor&#39;, right?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Alliance?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The eyes of the &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39; rolled to both sides.</p>
[You guys are planning to fight against the Zodiac. Right?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You are also part of the Chinese zodiac.&quot;</p>
[That&#39;s true, but I&#39;m a little different. So, I…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, I had a strange feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Rat eating fingernails.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, this constellation was one of the constellations that had been watching us from the beginning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A constellation that even appeared in my &#39;behind the scenes selection&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, this guy has been watching the story of me and my companions for a very long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That means.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You-&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A puzzle that slowly comes together in my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were several constellations that showed behavior patterns that were clearly different from &#39;Ways of Survival&#39; or &#39;Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint&#39; that I had suspected from the beginning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39; was one of them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39; must have found some hope in my tone of voice and shook his head fervently.</p>
[Yes, that’s right. I am also like you. Me too.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The guy with his eyes tightly closed seemed to have decided on something and started talking.</p>
[I am a reader like you—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I found you, Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A voice that flutters cold blood. Killer King was there, covered in bears&#39; blood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King spoke while aiming a bow gun filled with black magic power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Get out of the way. I’ll kill that rat.&quot;</p>
[Heeeeeeeeek!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The rat, startled, quickly hid behind me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued speaking while stopping Killer King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait a minute, Killer King-ssi. This is—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39;. He is from the zodiac.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know that, but he—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Possessed people like us.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if he already knew, Killer King did not withdraw his bowgun. An unusual anger was boiling all over his body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This guy is the &#39;Misreading Association&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Misreading Association?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Have you already forgotten what happened at the Edge of Darkness?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t forget. Of course I remembered it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The place where I first met the Killer King siblings. There, I fought against the incarnations sent by the constellations of the Misreading Association.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy who sent those incarnations back then was also a &#39;rat&#39;.</p>
[Oh, no. I am not a tyrant! Really!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s a lie. They know we can&#39;t use [Lie Detection] here, so they&#39;re deceiving us.&quot;</p>
[Because it’s not! It’s really unfair!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I saw you exchanging indirect messages with the Misreading Association constellations in the past.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At Killer King&#39;s words, the &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39; once again rolled its eyes.</p>
[Oh, no. is it so. I did talk to them a bit! But really, I’m not from the Misreading Association!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Questions and answers are useless. Die.&quot;</p>
[Eeeeeek!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I thought about whether I should stop Killer King, the white-faced &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39; crouched down and shouted.</p>
[Shit! It&#39;s ruined! The &#39;Misreading Association&#39; you know is already ruined!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">For the first time, Killer King stopped moving.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What does that mean?&quot;</p>
[After all, there is no such thing as the &#39;Misreading Association&#39; that you know! So, stop targeting us!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If you look at it that way, the constellations on the side of the &#39;Misreading Association&#39; have not been visible at all recently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King, who had been staring at the guy for a while, slowly lowered his bowgun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Explain.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The very excited &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39; started saying things like &quot;This is why I didn’t want to come&quot; and then started crying and screaming.</p>
[I feel really unfair. I didn&#39;t really do anything! I&#39;m not the one who moved the beastmen! I, I just want to let you guys know, how much I—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was at that time that I heard a thump and a vibration echoing from somewhere.</p>
[How much, how much, ah, ah, ugh—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39; that was licking its lips suddenly started violently eating its own fingernails.</p>
[Oh, it’s coming. Come. He&#39;s coming. The guy is coming.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What?</p>
[Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Nail-Eating Rat&#39;’s eyes turned white and he soon collapsed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King checked the guy’s pulse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He’s not dead. But—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Something is strange.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of weapons that filled the vacant lot until the end of the war could not be heard at all. The screams and shouts of the prisoners disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King and I ran toward the clearing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The prisoners waving their weapons at each other were still there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They all had their weapons laid down on the floor, their heads buried in the ground, and their palms turned toward the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if they were worshiping their god.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even the &#39;bear that saves One&#39;s life if One pretends to be dead&#39; was lying quietly on the floor as if he were dead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A disturbingly strange sight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King’s voice trembled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was looking at the sky and pointed at something with his finger. A swirling portal was visible high in the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The portal to the upper floor was open.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a portal that also appeared in 「The Three Little Pigs」. At that time, the symbolic body of the pig constellations came through that portal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So what happened this time?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I heard someone approaching from behind.</p>
【Student .】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lycaon, who had always been in the lotus position while maintaining a small incarnation, returned to his original form.</p>
【Run away right now.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And then, from somewhere, I started hearing a story.</p>
「…&quot;I won’t eat you.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A voice from a very old story.</p>
「...delicious.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a chill as if someone had grabbed my heart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So far I have met several constellations. I fought against an Outer God, and even saw &#39;Ares&#39;, a narrative-grade constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So, deep down, I thought I wasn’t afraid of things like the Chinese Zodiac.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However.</p>
「Give me a piece of rice cake.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I saw the shadow of a huge constellation that seemed to be about a hundred meters tall, I cursed my poor imagination.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Above the distant shadow that covered the ground, glowing red eyes were looking down at us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is that really a &lt;zodiac sign&gt;?</p>
「I won’t eat you.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Its pattern burns like a flame.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A story heard occasionally and intermittently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought I knew who this guy was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A shadowy pressureslowly raised its head towards me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sparks exploded violently in the air, and cold sweat formed on the back of my neck. I felt like my heart was being squeezed and blood was flowing from my nose.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew it instinctively.</p>
「That is God.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was a great-grade constellation that descended in a form close to its true body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But how?</p>
<p class="orv_line">How was it possible for that constellation to descend to this place, where even the pig constellations had to come as symbols?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was impossible without a probable cause.</p>
「Probability justification.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I raised my head, biting my lip. The guy&#39;s eyes were right in front of my nose.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The Tiger Eating Rice Cake…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did I realize.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason he was able to come here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you want to take me to the &#39;Zodiac Ball&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was because of me.</p>
