<p class="orv_line">The possibility of a nebula.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I read the message over and over again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart was beating deeply. Even though there is no incarnation that has become a constellation yet, there is a 'possibility of a nebula'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps this is also the influence of the newly developed story?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The voices of the group rejoicing were heard from afar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"They say a new story is sprouting?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This can’t be—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It was worth including a panda every time I repaired a story fragment."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is it really because of that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is a story that neither I nor Han Sooyoung can write.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a story that was not found in 'Ways of Survival' or 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' and could only be created by those who read it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story was now slowly sprouting before our eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「People who wanted to see the story of a very 'big house'.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt certain that it was fate.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someday I will transcribe their stories. The emotions and scenery of this moment will be sketched out in crude sentences.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I held on to 'Unbreakable Faith'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Jonghyuk, please protect the brick house."</p>
<p class="orv_line">For the story that will be written someday, I must hold the sword now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We must protect this moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I slowly blinked, the sound disappeared from my ears. Instead, all I could hear was the sound of stories talking.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive attribute effect activates!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Some stories were familiar and some were unfamiliar. There were disturbing stories, and there were also sad stories.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I hate pandas」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I want to be like a panda too」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「All you have to do is defeat the southern guys and steal their stories.」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Actually, I don’t want to do that.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And there was a story floating around about bears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A story that incites the bears’ desires.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story fragment 'Fanning' continues its storytelling.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Fanning.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was the identity of the story fragment that moved the bear beastmen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone must have used this story fragment to fuel the bears' desire and lead them here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked closely at the way the fragments of the story had been spread.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While the constellation 'A bear that saves Ones life if Onepretends to be dead' and other bear beastmen are all affected by this 'story fragment'—</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「There was one bear that was unaffected by this 'story fragment'.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment our eyes met, he turned his back to me and started running away.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The item 'Sylphid’s Leap Boots' activates!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The item’s performance is halved due to the scenario effect.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It doesn't matter if it's halved.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' opens its eyes!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Reclining Dragon' admires your judgment!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, he wasn't that fast.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dead end street.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Without hesitation, I swung my 'Unbreakable Faith' at him. With a popping sound, the bear's appearance changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a 'rat' the size of a small child.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' is looking at you!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The zodiac.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely true.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is a 'rat', one of the Chinese zodiac animals, belonging to the 'characters'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tensed and held the hilt of the sword tightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If that is really the <Zodiac>, it must be a constellation of at least great-grade level.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'bear that will come back to life if you pretend to be dead' that was talking in the vacant lot was also a constellation, but it was not of the level of a proper great-grade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the <Zodiac> is different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A proper 'great-grade constellation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a difficult opponent for me now. All kinds of thoughts flowed quickly through my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I expected that the <Zodiac> was related to this matter, but I had no idea that the constellations from the <Zodiac> would be there in person.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Should I run away?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Or should I give it my all and give it a shot before it shows its true power?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What if we use stories?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What if we use Kim Dokja’s story from 「Heir of the Eternal Name」?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Or-</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Now, wait a minute—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Unexpectedly, it was the rat who spoke first.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Don’t hurt me! I didn't come to fight!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something was strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The use of mantras and indirect messages, as well as the sensations felt, were clearly from a constellation. But the constellation barely has this level of status?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I was just watching! I’m curious about what kind of guys you are—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If you think about it, it was strange that a proper constellation appeared with its incarnation in tow, but there was no repercussions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is the eighth scenario area. If a 'great-grade constellation' had unleashed its true power, the scenario should have exploded a long time ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there were no signs of a probability aftermath in the surrounding area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don’t lie."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[It-it’s true!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After buying some time by saying something, I observed the guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnation of the 'Nail-Eating Rat' is a small, small rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much I tried to sharpen my senses, I could barely feel any fighting power. At this level, it was safe to say that it was almost below a symbolic body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What is his purpose? Why on earth did he appear here in such an incarnation?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I narrowed my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The scream of a brown bear was heard behind me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, the group began to herd the bears. I said, looking back at the bodies of the dead bears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That’s what you guys did. You used story fragments to control the bears. Are you going to act like a fool?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Well, that might be so! But I didn't order it! I swear!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' shouts that it is real!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A strangely fearful 'Nail-Eating Rat'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glared at that guy and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You didn’t do it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Nail-Eating Rat' nodded enthusiastically.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then why were you here?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I told you earlier! I just want to see you in person—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Say it straight."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I took a step closer and aimed with 'Unbreakable Faith', the 'Nail-Eating Rat' made a 'hissing' sound and quickly continued speaking.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Yes, actually, I came to ask for an alliance. You guys are also going up to the next 'floor', right?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Alliance?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The eyes of the 'Nail-Eating Rat' rolled to both sides.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You guys are planning to fight against the Zodiac. Right?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"You are also part of the Chinese zodiac."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[That's true, but I'm a little different. So, I…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, I had a strange feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Rat eating fingernails.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, this constellation was one of the constellations that had been watching us from the beginning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A constellation that even appeared in my 'behind the scenes selection'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, this guy has been watching the story of me and my companions for a very long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That means.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You-"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A puzzle that slowly comes together in my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were several constellations that showed behavior patterns that were clearly different from 'Ways of Survival' or 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' that I had suspected from the beginning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Nail-Eating Rat' was one of them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Nail-Eating Rat' must have found some hope in my tone of voice and shook his head fervently.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Yes, that’s right. I am also like you. Me too.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The guy with his eyes tightly closed seemed to have decided on something and started talking.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I am a reader like you—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I found you, Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A voice that flutters cold blood. Killer King was there, covered in bears' blood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King spoke while aiming a bow gun filled with black magic power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Get out of the way. I’ll kill that rat."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Heeeeeeeeek!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The rat, startled, quickly hid behind me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued speaking while stopping Killer King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait a minute, Killer King-ssi. This is—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The 'Nail-Eating Rat'. He is from the zodiac."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know that, but he—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Possessed people like us."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if he already knew, Killer King did not withdraw his bowgun. An unusual anger was boiling all over his body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This guy is the 'Misreading Association'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Misreading Association?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Have you already forgotten what happened at the Edge of Darkness?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't forget. Of course I remembered it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The place where I first met the Killer King siblings. There, I fought against the incarnations sent by the constellations of the Misreading Association.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy who sent those incarnations back then was also a 'rat'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Oh, no. I am not a tyrant! Really!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"It's a lie. They know we can't use [Lie Detection] here, so they're deceiving us."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Because it’s not! It’s really unfair!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I saw you exchanging indirect messages with the Misreading Association constellations in the past."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At Killer King's words, the 'Nail-Eating Rat' once again rolled its eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Oh, no. is it so. I did talk to them a bit! But really, I’m not from the Misreading Association!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Questions and answers are useless. Die."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Eeeeeek!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I thought about whether I should stop Killer King, the white-faced 'Nail-Eating Rat' crouched down and shouted.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Shit! It's ruined! The 'Misreading Association' you know is already ruined!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">For the first time, Killer King stopped moving.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What does that mean?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[After all, there is no such thing as the 'Misreading Association' that you know! So, stop targeting us!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If you look at it that way, the constellations on the side of the 'Misreading Association' have not been visible at all recently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King, who had been staring at the guy for a while, slowly lowered his bowgun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Explain."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The very excited 'Nail-Eating Rat' started saying things like "This is why I didn’t want to come" and then started crying and screaming.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I feel really unfair. I didn't really do anything! I'm not the one who moved the beastmen! I, I just want to let you guys know, how much I—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was at that time that I heard a thump and a vibration echoing from somewhere.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[How much, how much, ah, ah, ugh—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Nail-Eating Rat' that was licking its lips suddenly started violently eating its own fingernails.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Oh, it’s coming. Come. He's coming. The guy is coming.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Nail-Eating Rat'’s eyes turned white and he soon collapsed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King checked the guy’s pulse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He’s not dead. But—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Something is strange."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of weapons that filled the vacant lot until the end of the war could not be heard at all. The screams and shouts of the prisoners disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King and I ran toward the clearing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The prisoners waving their weapons at each other were still there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They all had their weapons laid down on the floor, their heads buried in the ground, and their palms turned toward the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if they were worshiping their god.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even the 'bear that saves One's life if One pretends to be dead' was lying quietly on the floor as if he were dead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A disturbingly strange sight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King’s voice trembled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was looking at the sky and pointed at something with his finger. A swirling portal was visible high in the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The portal to the upper floor was open.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a portal that also appeared in 「The Three Little Pigs」. At that time, the symbolic body of the pig constellations came through that portal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So what happened this time?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I heard someone approaching from behind.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Student .】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lycaon, who had always been in the lotus position while maintaining a small incarnation, returned to his original form.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Run away right now.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And then, from somewhere, I started hearing a story.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「…"I won’t eat you."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A voice from a very old story.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「...delicious.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a chill as if someone had grabbed my heart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So far I have met several constellations. I fought against an Outer God, and even saw 'Ares', a narrative-grade constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So, deep down, I thought I wasn’t afraid of things like the Chinese Zodiac.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Give me a piece of rice cake.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I saw the shadow of a huge constellation that seemed to be about a hundred meters tall, I cursed my poor imagination.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Above the distant shadow that covered the ground, glowing red eyes were looking down at us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is that really a <zodiac sign>?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I won’t eat you.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Its pattern burns like a flame.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A story heard occasionally and intermittently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought I knew who this guy was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A shadowy pressureslowly raised its head towards me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sparks exploded violently in the air, and cold sweat formed on the back of my neck. I felt like my heart was being squeezed and blood was flowing from my nose.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew it instinctively.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「That is God.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was a great-grade constellation that descended in a form close to its true body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But how?</p>
<p class="orv_line">How was it possible for that constellation to descend to this place, where even the pig constellations had to come as symbols?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was impossible without a probable cause.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Probability justification.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I raised my head, biting my lip. The guy's eyes were right in front of my nose.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The Tiger Eating Rice Cake…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did I realize.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason he was able to come here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you want to take me to the 'Zodiac Ball'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was because of me.</p>
