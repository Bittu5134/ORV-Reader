<p class="orv_line">An hour after Cheon Inho fainted, Yoo Jonghyuk went to Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The group that came with him was as follows.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Steel Emperor Lee Hyunsung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maritime Admiral Lee Jihye.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Delusional Demon Kim Namwoon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Doctor Lee Seolhwa.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Beast Tamer Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The five incarnations who have been by his side for the past dozens of rounds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you look closely, they were all people with at least one flaw.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung was too foolish, and Lee Jihye was too simple. Kim Namwoon was a crazy person, and Lee Seolhwa was often bitter. Shin Yoosoung was weak-hearted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He repeatedly changed the main members or formed new parties several times.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But in the end, these are the five that remain. They were the only ones who stayed by Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s side until the very end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ugh, this is my first time in America. Has Seolhwa ever been here?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Seolhwa answered Lee Jihye’s question with a faint smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;When I was young.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Tsk. I know a lot about America. Jihye, are you curious?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m nervous because the only time I ever deployed troops was to Iraq.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hyunsung, you’re always nervous.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Compared to the previous round, the mood among the group was brighter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk found Shin Yoosoung remaining silent alone in the midst of a lively conversation. Although she originally had a dark personality, the shadow that now fell on Shin Yoosoung&#39;s face was not just due to her personality.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Yoo Jonghyuk was about to approach Shin Yoosoung, a voice was heard from behind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That’s amazing. Is that the status of the &#39;Five Heavenly Emperors&#39; who protect the Supreme King?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk frowned and thought. Looking back, there was another &#39;party that came with him&#39;. He just didn&#39;t consider them his companions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Five Heavenly Emperors? Was there a nickname like that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I attached it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do not pollute the Book of Revelation.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A beautiful woman sighed lightly behind two bickering young men.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk knew who they were.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kang Ilhoon, although his tone is harsh, is believed to be the incarnation of an archangel.</p>
<p class="orv_line"> Ye Hyunwoo, the de facto leader of the Chungmuro Group and the teammate of Armed Castle Lord Gong Pildu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Seyeon who possesses strong interpersonal fighting skills and is armed with S-class or higher items.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were the incarnations who quickly emerged as new powerhouses in this round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although he never told anyone, Yoo Jonghyuk knew one thing the three had in common.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;They are past evildoers.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Their names remained in his memories of the last round that came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Small villains who were major thieves, betrayed their party, or became looters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">These little villains were proudly leading the incarnations to the forefront of the main scenario this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be exact, it wasn&#39;t just them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Dansu ahjussi, why are you sighing like that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Another man and woman followed behind them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk even knew their names.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As expected, I’m worried about Inho-ssi. I should have stayed too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although not as strong as Lee Hyunsung, Kyung Sein is the second-strongest tanker after Lee Hyunsung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although his fighting skills are not outstanding, Lee Dansu reminds him of &#39;Selena Kim&#39;, who was the Immortal King in the previous round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he remembers well, he also had a minor dispute with these incarnations in a certain round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Is it a coincidence? Or not…&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if it was a coincidence, there was nothing particularly strange about it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the countless rounds of his life, every human being, including Yoo Jonghyuk himself, became a villain at least once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What Yoo Jonghyuk learned through this was that humans are just empty vessels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All humans become completely different beings depending on what kind of &#39;tale&#39; they face and what kind of story they live.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He knows it&#39;s true.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, it was not easy to admit the truth that just one man instigated it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Cheon Inho.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">So far, without a single exception, &#39;Cheon Inho&#39; has been a villain in all rounds. Whether small or large, he became a villain and blocked Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s path.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if that was his absolute mission.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, &#39;Cheon Inho&#39; in this round has not yet become a villain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk found that fact very strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Mia, who was walking next to him, squeezed his left hand. Yoo Jonghyuk spoke without shaking her hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It is nothing.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You thought of the man with narrow eyes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He is dangerous.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He looks like that old swindler.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But if you listen to what people say, he seems to be a good swindler.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Good swindler.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">While Yoo Jonghyuk was surprised that young Yoo Mia knew such an expression, he wondered whether he should correct the contradiction in the expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But he couldn&#39;t think of anything to retort.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead, Yoo Jonghyuk decided to recall the memories of the last round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What a bad guy he was in the last round and how dangerous it is to trust him...</p>
[&#39;The Redemption of Truth&#39; controls your memory.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Redemption of Truth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One of the three stories he engraved.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This imprint seals some of the memories in exchange for great power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although he was a little concerned that this memory had been sealed, Yoo Jonghyuk didn&#39;t really care.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In any case, the &#39;memory&#39; that would be the key to clearing this round was remembered by someone other than him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s been a long time, King Yoo Jonghyuk.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Across from the casino hotel stood the person whose memories he wanted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Zarathustra&#39;s representative and his old enemy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Anna Croft.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">While heading to the Washington Dome, Yoo Jonghyuk tried to avoid eye contact with Anna Croft as much as possible.</p>
[&#39;Emotional restraint&#39; stirs.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This is because it was difficult to handle the growing excitement in real time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He wanted to bring Cheon Inho to prepare for this kind of situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it might be too late to turn back now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Prophet. There is a memory I need. Use [past tense].&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I exhausted all my reps today.&quot;</p>
[You are using &#39;Lie Detection&#39;.]</p></div>
[&#39;Lie Detection&#39; confirmed that the statement was true.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft&#39;s expression hardened at the message about using the skill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Lie Detection, do you not have the minimum level of trust?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’d rather trust a good swindler than trust you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who is the good swindler?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don’t pry into unnecessary things.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You brought it up first—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’ll tell you in advance, I don’t have much patience in this round.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead of answering, Anna Croft glared at him with disapproving eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, Yu Jonghyuk felt the urge to pull out his spear and hit her on the head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was because dozens of past tragedies caused by Anna Croft came to mind all at once.</p>
[Exclusive skill &#39;Redemption Lv.5&#39; is being activated.]</p></div>
[The influence of &#39;Redemption&#39; is temporarily weakened by the effect of &#39;Three Persons&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But he had to endure it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At least she&#39;ll be useful until all the constellations in this world run out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the moment Yoo Jonghyuk checked the local situation, he began to doubt Anna Croft&#39;s &#39;usefulness&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why did the scenario end up like this?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In only the fifth scenario, the entire Washington Dome was eroded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The surviving incarnations make up about 5% of the entire population of the dome.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was something that had never happened in any round before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;An unexpected situation occurred.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There’s always something like that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I had a plan.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;A plan that cannot be kept is useless. If you cannot come up with a convincing answer, you will die here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft let out a deep sigh at his threat. It was a strangely despondent sigh that he had never seen before in any round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yoo Jonghyuk. Have you ever heard of a group called &#39;Apostles&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk nodded his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As expected... it looks like they were in Korea too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judging by the way she spoke, it seemed that Washington&#39;s downfall had something to do with the &#39;Apostles&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Could it be that Korea also failed to kill the disasters?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I am in Korea.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Of course it is. I was just asking just in case.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk ended the fifth scenario in Korea.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A disaster that was different from his memories appeared and the method of dealing with it was a little different from the previous round, but the scenario itself went smoothly anyway.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It hasn’t been smooth sailing for us.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I guess I know roughly what the situation is.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk also heard something about the &#39;Apostles&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Beings who know the &#39;future&#39; of the world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That’s what happens because you rely too much on things like [future sight]. You probably know that there is no such thing as a fixed future.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The future was written. Until they showed up.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft has been clearing the scenarios by reading the future and preparing for it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, in this round, the variable &#39;Apostles&#39; intervened and all her plans went awry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you help me with this matter, I will definitely repay your debt, King.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I hope you can continue to be useful until the debt is paid.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment they entered the portal, the surrounding scenery changed into waves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk had his companions wait for a while and then went up to a nearby high-rise building to check the view.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was not his first time visiting the Washington Dome.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it was his first time seeing a scene like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed as if the entire city was buried in pitch-black ashes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no sight of living incarnations anywhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All the high-rise buildings that made up the skyscrapers were in ruins, and the sky was covered with fog that obscured even the light of the stars.</p>
<p class="orv_line">On the roof of the building, black roots reminiscent of a tree growing upside down were sprouting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk tore off the root without hesitation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, a roaring black ether poured out between the torn roots.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A &#39;dark root&#39; that vomits demonic energy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was definitely true.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;The Demon Realm.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He doesn&#39;t know what number this demon realm was, but the &#39;Washington Dome&#39; was invaded by a demon realm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk, who landed lightly on the ground, asked Anna.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Have you secured the parts of the Earth Dragon species?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m trying.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order to fight in an invaded demon world, [Purification] work is essential. Otherwise, you will be cursed.</p>
[Currently, the &#39;Washington Dome&#39; has been eroded by the demon realm.]</p></div>
[&#39;Local curse&#39; is activated!]</p></div>
[Spiritual power decreases slightly in the area!]</p></div>
[Comprehensive stats are partially reduced in that area!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Judging from the extent of the invasion, it was not yet at an irreversible level.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, if the scenario proceeds like this, leaving Washington alone, the city will truly become part of the &#39;Demon Realm&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As time goes by, the Demon Realm will expand and eventually the entire Earth will fall under the Demon King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That must be prevented at all costs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“What kind of demon king is it?”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now, let&#39;s go to the seventh scenario, the Washington Dome.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The demon king will not be able to descend in person.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Therefore, there was a high possibility that the owner of this dome was a subordinate of a specific demon king.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It was the first time I have ever heard this demon king.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Was it your first time hearing about it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk knew the true names of all the demon kings who ruled the 72 demon worlds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The same would apply to the prophet in front of him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, if a demon king with a name they had never heard of appeared, the implications of that fact were clear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Christina confirmed—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A new &#39;Demon King&#39; has appeared in the Demon Realm in this round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They called their master the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;.&quot;</p>
