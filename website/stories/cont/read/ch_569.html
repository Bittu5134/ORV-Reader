<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, this time it was a comment that could infer the context of the text.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, the content of the serialized excerpt was describing my current situation of possession.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My head was spinning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who is publishing this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is someone writing this story under my name instead of me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this is a novel, are my thoughts being described?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「If so, am I thinking, or am I being thought.」</div>「If so, am I thinking, or am I being thought.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was nothing I could tell for certain right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon came to me during a break after the food distribution was over.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Can I sit next to you for a while?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, sure.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon sat down on the bench I was sitting on. However, she didn&#x27;t speak to me right</p>
<p class="orv_line">away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hadn&#x27;t realized it before because I was too busy, but it felt strange to think that the character I</p>
<p class="orv_line">wrote was sitting next to me.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">This person is definitely not a type.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The white skin, long hair, and deep eyes looking at me are all real.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was indeed present in front of me now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m sorry about earlier, Sein told me it was a misunderstanding. She said it was because you</p>
<p class="orv_line">look so much like the person she hated.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, it was a misunderstanding. It&#x27;s fine.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s not that I looked alike, I am the one she hated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pulled a canned drink out of my pocket and handed it over.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Would you like some?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, thanks.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We sat side by side and drank our canned drinks, both of us staring out at the empty tracks, and I</p>
<p class="orv_line">remembered the text of Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, Kim Dokja also sat on the platform at Geumho Station with Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The train won&#x27;t come anymore, will it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how long we wait, the train won&#x27;t come. Neither will the next train, nor the one after</p>
<p class="orv_line">that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the lack of trains didn&#x27;t mean anyone was going to die right away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I guess I&#x27;ll just have to get used to walking.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon glanced at me and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;re so calm, Inho-ssi. I can&#x27;t do that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s because I usually have strange imaginations.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon smiled bitterly at the words &#x27;strange imaginations&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s funny, Sein said something similar.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to Jung Heewon, she and Kyung Sein were trapped in the same area in the first</p>
<p class="orv_line">scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew the gist of it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She told me that, as she panicked, Kyung Sein caught a bug for her, and that&#x27;s how they survived.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Luckily, there must have been a lot of bugs.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There was only one bug.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Thinking about it, we were lucky to have vending machines in our area, but I&#x27;m sure not all areas</p>
<p class="orv_line">had.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surely, there must have been areas with very few bugs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m the only one who survived with the bug.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And Sein-ssi.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It was self-defense. He had nothing to say even if he died.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The expression on Jung Heewon&#x27;s face as she said that, somehow reminded me of the &#x27;Judge of</p>
<p class="orv_line">Evil&#x27; from Omniscient Reader that I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But she killed a man? It didn&#x27;t look like it from the outside.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;By the way, Cheon Inho-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you happen to know me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And what you said earlier.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">What did I say earlier?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That...... No.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Heewon-nim... I love you... Surely...」</div>「Heewon-nim... I love you... Surely...」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Goosebumps suddenly rose on my forearms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thinking about it, it wasn&#x27;t a strange that Jung Heewon misunderstand me in that kind of</p>
<p class="orv_line">situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You should just forget about it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Shall we?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought I felt a strange gaze in the distance, but it was Kyung Sein who had stopped squatting</p>
<p class="orv_line">and was staring at us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thank God. I was actually worried that you were a strange person.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You don&#x27;t have to worry about that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#x27;m afraid of what Ji Eunyoo will say if she finds out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What kind of writer confesses to a character they created?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon scratched her cheek at my strong denial and smiled.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Anyway, keep up the good work. I was a little surprised to see you handing out food to people</p>
<p class="orv_line">earlier, I didn&#x27;t expect that.&quot;</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Character &#x27;Jung Heewon&#x27; has a faint sense of trust in you.]</div>[Character 'Jung Heewon' has a faint sense of trust in you.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">Wow, all these rewards?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho didn&#x27;t get to enjoy any of this and died right away in the main story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I have to be really nice to Kim Dokja when I meet him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yes, Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was time to go meet the real Kim Dokja.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is everyone ready to go?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Not yet, wait a bit.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi each held a pipe with a cloth tied around the handle. These were</p>
<p class="orv_line">our temporary weapons for the time being.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But are you going to leave the Cheoldoo Group here? I thought you made a group to lead the</p>
<p class="orv_line">way in times like this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">She wasn&#x27;t wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, if we were accompanied by the Cheoldoo Group unnecessarily and ran into Kim</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dokja or Yoo Joonghyuk, we might get into trouble.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein nodded in understanding.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I see. It would be easy to misunderstand, but if you put it that way, Cheon Inho-ssi&#x27;s existence is</p>
<p class="orv_line">a problem.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We&#x27;ll find an excuse somehow.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you going to say?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sein-ssi should say it, not me. Do you think Kim Dokja or Yoo Joonghyuk would listen to me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, yeah. Uh...... what should I say? I&#x27;m not good at talking. So where would they be by now?&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They&#x27;re probably just finishing up the &#x27;Even Bridge&#x27; scenario.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the main part of Omnscient Reader, Kim Dokja and the others are separated by the breaking of</p>
<p class="orv_line">the Dongho Bridge.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Since Kim Dokja would have been eaten by the ichthyousaur straight away, we&#x27;re likely to meet</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk, Lee Hyunsung, Yoo Sangah, Lee Gilyoung...... the other members first.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s what would be common sense.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, that&#x27;s assuming the scenario plays out in the same way as in the original.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We&#x27;ll probably meet Han Myungoh, too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Dansoo ahjussi who said that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed that he was finally ready to leave, too, and something was floating over his head. He</p>
<p class="orv_line">must have gotten some sort of privilage from his constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thank goodness, at least it wasn&#x27;t a very bad constellation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Sneaking Schemer&#x27; looks forward to incarnation &#x27;Lee Dansoo&#x27;.]</div>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' looks forward to incarnation 'Lee Dansoo'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So the three of us are going like this? Will that be okay?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi had a strangely worried face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Actually, I was worried too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Right now, we only had a man with a naturally muscular body and a girl with the soul of a</p>
<p class="orv_line">muscular man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you have any combat skills? Like [Weapon Training]?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In response to my question, Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi shook their heads at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We didn&#x27;t even have the basics.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Kyung Sein was confident.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Still, don&#x27;t you think we can handle a few ground rats? We&#x27;ve got some experience.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I agreed with that, too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is who we are.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s a party of Omniscient Reader writer (though Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi didn&#x27;t know yet)</p>
<p class="orv_line">and Omniscient Reader completionists.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, it&#x27;s a story where the author, reader, and protagonist work together to reach the ending,</p>
<p class="orv_line">so there&#x27;s nothing we can&#x27;t do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;By the way, can we just talk about the novel like this? The constellations—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;ll be fine. Even in Omniscient Reader, all the stuff about Ways of Survival is filtered out at</p>
<p class="orv_line">the beginning.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But there&#x27;s no guarantee that&#x27;ll be the case here—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">talking about.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">incorrectly.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein shook her head in admiration.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow, it&#x27;s true. As expected of Omniscient Reader.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was that an insult or a compliment?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t bother to ask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We stepped into the tunnel that led straight to Oksu Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the darkness of the claustrophobic tunnel enveloped us, I was suddenly aware of my heavy</p>
<p class="orv_line">breathing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One step, two steps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A chill seeping into my ankles with each step. The sensation of being in real danger was</p>
<p class="orv_line">palpable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All three of us seemed to be thinking the same thing, but none of us spoke up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, it was Kyung Sein, who had the soul of a muscular man, who spoke first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Should we just go back? I mean, we can wait at Geumho Station and still meet them, so why go</p>
<p class="orv_line">out of our way?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s better if we pick them up. You know, in case something happens.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sure...... the first scenario has changed.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s go, and if it looks like we&#x27;re in danger, we&#x27;ll run.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, I had no intention of running away. For my own safety, it was best to make contact</p>
<p class="orv_line">with the main characters at this timing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The worst that could happen was that Kim Dokja and the others were dead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But even if they were all dead, there would still be one person alive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The true protagonist of the &#x27;Ways of Survival&#x27; and the strongest incarnation of Omniscient</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If things were really going to go south, someone would have to confront him on Kim Dokja&#x27;s</p>
<p class="orv_line">behalf. Someone had to convince him, cajole him, and somehow see the end of this damned</p>
<p class="orv_line">scenario.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「But which one of us is up to the task?」</div>「But which one of us is up to the task?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was lost in thought for a second. As I returned to my thoughts, I could hear Kyung Sein and</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi talking. They were squatting together and had apparently become quite close.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you sign a sponsor contract too?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who did you sign with?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sneaking Schemer.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sneaking Schemer?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked him to stop talking, but he couldn&#x27;t help himself and bragged about it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For the record, Dansoo ahjussi still confuses &#x27;Sneaking Schemer&#x27; with &#x27;Secretive Plotter&#x27;, the most</p>
<p class="orv_line">powerful man in Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And just now,</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s not that constellation?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He realizes that&#x27;s not the right constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you just skim the novel?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi asked in a voice full of disbelief, and Kyung Sein frowned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you talking about? I&#x27;ve read it throughly. I&#x27;ve also read the &#x27;Encyclopedia of</p>
<p class="orv_line">Omniscient Reader&#x27; compiled by &#x27;RepresentativeKimDokja&#x27; at least ten times. How many times</p>
<p class="orv_line">have you seen it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What&#x27;s that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Forget it, the constellation you&#x27;re talking about is &#x27;Secretive Plotter&#x27;, not &#x27;Sneaking Schemer&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How could you get that mixed up?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No way.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi&#x27;s pupils twitched as if they were in an earthquake.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I-I&#x27;m sure Jiyoon said this constellation is the best...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because of Jiyoon or whatever you&#x27;re totally screwed. They look like a weird constellation.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Jiyoon is my daughter.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I watched the conversation with interest, I suddenly realized that I hadn&#x27;t heard any messages</p>
<p class="orv_line">from the &#x27;Sneaking Schemer&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If someone talked about you openly like this, wouldn&#x27;t you interrupt? Had he left the channel?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I became nervous. If we had made Bihyung&#x27;s channel less popular, the planned stream</p>
<p class="orv_line">contract talks could fall through.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Bihyung. Are you there?&#x27;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even when I tried talking to him, he didn&#x27;t reply.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did we lose communication?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A few constellations are talking about who is &#x27;Sneaking Schemer&#x27;.]</div>[A few constellations are talking about who is 'Sneaking Schemer'.]</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I realized that the channel wasn&#x27;t dead, as there still was a response from the constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could think about it later, now was the time to move.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s speed up a little bit.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s do it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">One minute later</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We&#x27;re slowing down.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi should lead the way. You&#x27;re the leader.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was not a powerful party of a writer and two completionists, it was just a party of wimps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this rate, we could walk all day to Oksu Station and still not make it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey, guys.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unexpectedly, it was Dansoo ahjussi who came to the rescue, looking like he was thinking about</p>
<p class="orv_line">something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you don&#x27;t mind, I&#x27;d like to do a little scouting on my own.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What? You&#x27;re going to get yourself killed, ahjussi. Your sponsor isn&#x27;t Secretive Plotter.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know. My sponsor is Sneaking Schemer.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">For some reason, at that moment, Dansoo ahjussi looked like a dashing Kim Dokja once again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So there&#x27;s something I can do.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahjussi stared at the floor and muttered something under his breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A moment later, dozens of cockroaches swarmed on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;U-uaak!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein clung onto me. I took a step back to avoid her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The cockroaches that had gathered near ahjussi moved their antennae as if to communicate with</p>
<p class="orv_line">him, and then they began to move in a single file line toward Oksu Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein shook her hand and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ahjussi. Isn&#x27;t that [Diverse Communication]? How did you learn that skill? Is your attribute</p>
<p class="orv_line">Insect Collector?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I recall correctly, there were only a few main characters in the original novel who had that</p>
<p class="orv_line">skill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He wiped the sweat from his forehead and said.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I got it from the constellation.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">From the constellation?</p>
<p class="orv_line">His sponsor gave him a skill like that?</p>

<p class="orv_line">Sing: The first boarding house I chose in college was very old, and there were a lot of</p>
<p class="orv_line">cockroaches. My older brother, who lived on the first floor, loved to tear off the legs of</p>
<p class="orv_line">cockroaches. From then on, I became afraid of people who were good at catching cockroaches.</p>
