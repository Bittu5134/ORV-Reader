<p class="orv_line">People from the ruined world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At my words, Carlton let out a light sigh and leaned against the wall, while Ryunard sat on a chair under the stone wall as if he was watching with interest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They seemed to agree with my expression, sad, and somehow amused.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And on the other hand, they seemed to have transcended all those emotions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Transcendents.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &lt;Star Stream&gt; granted them that title because they had overcome all the limitations of mortals, including emotions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, in the worldview they belonged to— 《Tree of Illusions 》, they were called by different names.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Awakened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Those who broke the limits of mortality and overcame the system. Those who live only in the time they set and understand the world with their own unique worldview.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A kind of god.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve met someone who remembers the 《Fantasy Tree》.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Do gods who have overcome emotions still have longing? As he spoke, a faint trace of emotion flashed through Cheongheo’s eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How do you know about that world?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s hard for me to explain in detail. I have some circumstances.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I see. If you know our true identities, then there’s no need to explain ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The three of them exchanged glances, their expressions relaxed for once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey, I feel good! Ask me anything you want! I’ll answer everything!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What called you here?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Um, I don’t know that either.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You said you’d answer anything.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How can you answer something you don’t know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheongheo smiled and answered instead of Ryunard, who bluntly stuck out his lips.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;When all three of us woke up, we were here. It was as if someone had called us, just like you said.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheongheo’s voice sounded somewhat floating, as if it still wasn’t quite real.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you create the Transcendent Alliance?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You mass-produced Transcendents?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, what can we do while we&#x27;re stuck here? We have special restrictions, so we can&#x27;t go outside the End Zone.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How long have you been here?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The three of them didn&#x27;t say anything. That must mean it&#x27;s been a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It was really boring at first. I took turns doing night watch with Uncle Carlton and Master Cheongheo, fighting those strange gods, and becoming friends...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then one day, people showed up.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The first one to come was Yoo Hosung. Next was Kyrgios, and then Minyoung and Junkyung came in.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were probably the only ones who could so casually call the Invincible One and the Paradoxical Baekcheong, the First Sword of Goryeo, and the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheongheo let out a hollow laugh for a moment, maybe having a special bond with the captains.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I didn&#x27;t know I&#x27;d be teaching stabbing here too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I listened to that story, something connected in my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, when Kyrgios first taught Kim Dokja, he also taught him &#x27;stabbing&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It was a little less boring back then, wasn&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. There&#x27;s also the reward of seeing the talented people grow.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The captains in particular are really no ordinary people. Even Captain Kyrgios is already stronger than me, right? You, a rookie, don&#x27;t know how great that is, but...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Chungheo whispered in a small voice, watching Ryunard talking nonsense.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ryunard is excited for the first time in a while.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Understand. He&#x27;s happy that you came.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He&#x27;s happy that I came?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;re special just by existing. You came all the way up to the &#x27;End of the World&#x27; on your own, you read all the prophecies as soon as you came, and you know about us. You&#x27;re already a huge incident here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">An incident.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why. Do you think we are acting too much like the constellations?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We have no choice but to live in the present. We need events. Events that occur in the time rift or events that occur here. Otherwise, we can&#x27;t stand it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There are questions that come up every time we are silent. Maybe my desire is not over yet. Why, I, we exist here now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Those simple and old questions drive us crazy.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought that maybe it was natural for them to become &#x27;managers of the time rift&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Have you found the answer to your question?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe. But I&#x27;m afraid to tell you the answer now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like I vaguely knew what the &#x27;answer&#x27; Cheongheo was thinking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead of guessing the answer, I said this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I have similar questions.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, really?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was just writing, and was dragged in, and suddenly became a villain character and lived here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s incredible when I think about it, but what can I do? It actually happened. Even now, I often ask myself. Why was it me? Because I am one of Kim Dokja’s reincarnations?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then why did I possess &#x27;Cheon Inho&#x27;?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I want to know the end of this world more than anyone else, but maybe I am afraid of knowing the secrets of this world.」</div>「I want to know the end of this world more than anyone else, but maybe I am afraid of knowing the secrets of this world.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe Cheongheo and I are a little similar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheongheo vaguely understood that fact and said,</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You are the type who asks questions &#x27;despite all that&#x27;. Isn’t that right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If I had to be specific, it would be that type of person.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;At this point, I think it wasn’t a coincidence that you read the &#x27;Prophecy of the End&#x27; all the way through.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, I apologize for that part.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No. You don’t have to feel sorry for us or the other transcendents for that. If there is a beginning to anything, there must be an end. All the transcendents here understand that fact well through the fault line. If the &#x27;end zone&#x27; ends here, then this is also the same story. Rather, everyone is interested.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Listening to Cheongheo&#x27;s words, I gradually came to understand why the Transcendents were so indifferent to the end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They must have already experienced the destruction of worlds big and small through the time rift.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s why they are no longer shaken or saddened by the destruction right before their eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is there no way to avoid the end?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No. The &#x27;end-level fear&#x27; is not something that can be avoided. For example, when the &#x27;end-level fear&#x27; opened last time—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;About half of the Transcendents were torn apart. The alliance almost collapsed once.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Carlton took out a book from his bosom and answered. He flipped through the pages of the book a few times and added briefly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Before that, when the &#x27;end-level fear&#x27; opened, a third of the entire time rift went wild.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, I remember that too. The commander-in-chief personally stepped in and stopped it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The reason it ended like that back then was because there was a &#x27;deal&#x27;…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Deal?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Chungheo smiled bitterly as he received my gaze.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There is no way to avoid the End, but it is not that there is no way to respond. There is a way to minimize the damage.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What is that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Dealing with the Recorders.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Speaking of the Recorders...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Have you heard of them? About the &#x27;Recorders of Fear&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I paused.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this story finally coming up?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;In the &#x27;lines&#x27; of this time fault, there is a place where the Recorders reside. However, not just anyone can meet them, and only those who possess a special &#x27;interpretation&#x27; of fear or are qualified can have a private conversation with them.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do they have the power to stop the End?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Even they cannot completely stop the End. However... &quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheongheo seemed very cautious about what he said next.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They can &#x27;rewrite&#x27; this world.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In an instant, goosebumps ran through my entire body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hurriedly asked back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Can I meet them too?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Unfortunately, it&#x27;s impossible for you. If you had come in a few months earlier, it would have been different...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Master, there&#x27;s a way.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ryunard, who had been watching the conversation with a smirk, said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Newbie. If you first resolve the natural disaster level or higher terror that appeared in the time gap, you will have one chance to face them.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ryunard, natural disaster level is not a level of terror that the current rookie can resolve.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know. But let&#x27;s tell the truth.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Natural disaster level terror.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was the level given to the &#x27;Dream Eater&#x27; I encountered when I entered here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The current rookie will have a hard time. If he trains here for at least a hundred years, I don&#x27;t know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Carlton was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As of now, no matter what I do, there is no way to solve the &#x27;natural disaster level horror&#x27; on my own.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I guess there is no other way. If this is the case, I think it would be better to use a desperate measure to get their help—</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Chief Commander! There&#x27;s something wrong with the time fault!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A transcendent that was inspecting the fault from the edge came running out of breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There&#x27;s something wrong with the fault that the captain of the third platoon entered.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, a hologram screen appeared before my eyes. Upon closer inspection, it was the very same time fault that Cheok Junkyeong and the third platoon had entered before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They had gone in to hunt the &#x27;dragon eater&#x27;, a terrifying disaster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But as far as I know, Cheok Junkyeong had already dealt with that Outer God...</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Kuaaaah!</p>
<p class="orv_line">A bloody wind blew through the screen, and I saw the heads of two members of the third platoon flying away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The swords that lightly sliced ​​off the heads of the transcendents and were wandering through the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were swords I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Excalibur?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Among them, I saw Arthur&#x27;s holy relic. However, the one holding that holy relic wasn&#x27;t King Arthur.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That guy.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wings spread across the sky. A body with a skeletal appearance, decorated with molds from various cultures. The moment I saw the white shining crown of the guy, I realized who he was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The founder of the absolute throne.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed that he was already a famous Outer God here, so the transcendents who had gathered in the fault line hurriedly exchanged opinions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;An Outer God of the level of a natural disaster. Among them, he is the top tier.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Damn, I didn&#x27;t see that guy for a while so I thought he disappeared—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">On the screen, Cheok Junkyeong was seen swinging his sword like a madman and fighting against the &#x27;Founder of the Absolute Throne&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Kuhahahaha! It&#x27;s fun! It&#x27;s fun!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just watching it made my whole body shiver. The first sword of Goryeo, who didn&#x27;t back down even in front of Outer Gods, was swinging his sword fiercely and going berserk. It felt like the unbelievable clash was being transmitted all the way here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The captain of the third division can&#x27;t fight him alone.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">But an Outer God is an Outer God.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even Cheok Junkyeong was slowly getting more and more wounds on his incarnation body. If things continued like this, it was obvious how the match would end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked Cheongheo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who are the captains who can go?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The captain of the 0th division hasn&#x27;t come out of the fault yet. The 1st division has just been dispatched. There are no captains available right now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The faces of the Transcendents were dark.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, it was Carlton, the deputy captain of the 0th division, who stepped forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Me and Ryunard will go in.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No. You have to guard this place.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But if we leave it like that, the captain of the 3rd division—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You don&#x27;t even have &#x27;appropriate clothes&#x27; for that worldview, do you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Appropriate clothes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, Cheok Junkyeong&#x27;s explanation came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I think he said that the time fault is a kind of possession, and that you can&#x27;t use your &#x27;incarnation&#x27; inside the fault except in special cases.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Even if you go in, you can&#x27;t stop him in your current state.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, Cheongheo, who had been worrying, made a decision.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We can&#x27;t lose the captain of the 3rd division here. This time, I&#x27;ll do it myself—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ll do it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In an instant, the eyes of the Transcendents were focused on one place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I have an incarnation that fits the &#x27;time fault&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There is an &#x27;incarnation&#x27; that fits you in that time fault.]</div>[There is an 'incarnation' that fits you in that time fault.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know which time fault it is, but it seemed that Cheon Inho was still alive in that time fault.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Runyard shook his head and tried to dissuade me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Newbie, no matter what, I can&#x27;t let you go. Even if there is a suitable incarnation, the level of fear that you can enter and block is...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I can block it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even now, when I close my eyes, the scene comes to mind vividly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The events of that day that I can&#x27;t forget even if I die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt the story inside me stir and opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I killed that guy once.&quot;</p>
