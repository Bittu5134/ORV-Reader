<p class="orv_line">—Recorder of Fear</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Belonging to the planet Kronos.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Prince of the Imyuntar race and the first wolf—&#39;Lycaon Isparang&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This wolf, who appears as a guide in the &#39;fifth scenario&#39; in the main story, was a character whose whereabouts were unknown after clashing with another guide, &#39;Antinus&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is it really that &#39;Lycaon&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">After the identity of the &#39;God of the Other World&#39; was revealed, the party members expressed their surprise in different ways.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi, who could not join in on the surprise, asked hesitantly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who is Lycaon?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You know, the guide from the &#39;Disaster Scenario&#39;. The wolf from the meteorite.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, that guy… wasn’t he dead?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There was no mention of his death. His whereabouts became unknown after that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. That’s true, but…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo, who was shaking his head at Killer King’s words, glanced at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Dokja-ssi, how did you know that &#39;Lycaon&#39; had become a god of another world?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Indeed, I  thought Ye Hyunwoo would ask. Even though he has read it less times than the other apostles, he is the most quick-witted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo even called me &#39;Dokja-ssi&#39;. That probably means that he expects this answer to be like &#39;Kim Dokja&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I wasn’t even sure. It was a gamble.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not surprisingly, there was no additional setting or follow-up story regarding Lycaon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are bound to be characters whose importance decreases as the scenario progresses, and Lycaon was also a character who naturally existed in that way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, I did not mention Lycaon as a candidate for &#39;God of the Other World&#39; without thinking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It just occurred to me. Perhaps among the people we know, there are individuals who have evolved into &#39;Outer Gods&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Many of the &#39;Gods of the Other World&#39; in the main story were left without seeing the &#39;end&#39; of the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Most of them lose their ego and become &#39;nameless&#39;, but sometimes there are those who maintain their ego outside the scenario and increase their power by becoming Outer Gods.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, &#39;Asmodeus&#39; who appeared in this round was of that type.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So that&#39;s what I thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps among the characters who are not fully described in the main story, there may be someone who has become a &#39;god from another world&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It was a gamble with very low odds.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The odds were low.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, this was the &#39;Recycling Center&#39;, and I thought there was a high possibility that that kind of probability would have a positive effect.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And above all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There were two alternatives besides Lycaon.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Three precautions. As expected of Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who were the other two?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As you know, among the gods of another world, there is another being related to &#39;wolves&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I said those words, I looked down at little Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this because the previous battle was too much?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Or did he get sick from eating dirt? Yoo Jonghyuk was lying on the floor, completely exhausted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I put a thin blanket over him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;&#39;Kkoma Yoo Jonghyuk&#39; also appeared in the main story.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The second &#39;Outer God&#39; I was going to call did not have a story related to &#39;wolves&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there was a scene in the main story where he was compared to a &#39;wolf&#39;, so I thought it might be possible to call him that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hmm. Do you mean &#39;King of the Lone Wolves&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But would the &#39;being&#39; respond to the summons?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The probability would have been low. In fact, we haven’t even seen him in this round.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The second &#39;Outer God&#39; I considered was a &#39;Secretive Plotter&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the &#39;Secretive Plotter&#39; had reached his ◾️◾️ and crossed into a completely different world, so there was no certainty that he would respond to the call.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then what about the third?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The third is...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked up at the sky. In fact, the third response probability was as low as the second.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The third one was even less related to &#39;wolves&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, this is a world where 「a man who eats eight meals a day」 is recognized as a &#39;pig&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wolf ears headband. Do you remember?&quot;</p>
「The man wearing the wolf ears headband may also be recognized as a &#39;wolf&#39;.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo, who was thinking about something, opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wolf ears? When they went to the amusement park in Oz…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, that’s right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a world where all of Kim Dokja&#39;s memories become stories, the story of going to the amusement park with Han Sooyoung would certainly     survive as fragments of stories.</p>
[A constellation whose modifier has not yet been revealed is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even if he is not a deity from another world,  Kim Dokja, who possesses that &#39;story fragment&#39;, exists.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Kim Dokja is a being with a modifier like the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;…</p>
[&#39;Sub-scenario—The Three Little Pigs&#39; has ended.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, a scenario ending message appeared.</p>
[500 recycled coins were obtained as a reward.]</p></div>
[You have cleared the scenario in a way no one has tried before!]</p></div>
[Your achievements will transform the very foundation of the scenario!]</p></div>
[The story &#39;The Three Little Pigs&#39; loses influence in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The surrounding scenery shimmered and the night began to fade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did my companions&#39; faces brighten one by one, as if they realized it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The event scenario has been lifted and &#39;wolves&#39; can no longer threaten us. Because the &#39;wolf&#39; has just joined our side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If we’re going to fight the &lt;Zodiac&gt; in the future, we’ll need that guy’s power.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked back at Lycaon, who was standing about ten steps away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein asked with a slightly frightened expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is it okay? He’s a god from another world.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There is nothing to be afraid of as a god from another world. Even in the main story, they negotiated with a god from another world.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">From earlier, Lycaon had been muttering something at the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps he is exchanging messages with the Management Bureau regarding the &#39;Otherworld Covenant&#39;, or perhaps he is negotiating with the &#39;Recycling Center&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sighed lightly and looked back at my companions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And here. These are the &#39;masks&#39; we recovered earlier.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">One of the main purposes of this &#39;scenario&#39; was to obtain new &#39;masks&#39; for the group to use.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah. When did this happen—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a mask obtained from previously deceased wolf incarnations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you sure you don’t mind if we take it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When Dansu ahjussi lowered his head as if he was sorry, the other party members also lowered their heads as if they were being shamed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein said in a trembling voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I-I really couldn’t be of any help.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, you all did well.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly looked back at my companions and spoke emphatically.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the party members who recovered the masks put them on one by one, their bodies, which had been transformed, began to return to their original state.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead, faces that reflected the characteristics of their time as prisoners appeared on the surface of the mask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein is a squirrel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi is a turtle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cha Yerin is a snail.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo is a panda.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, the &#39;mask&#39; seemed to reflect the user&#39;s original characteristics.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, why am I still thinking, &#39;I’m free from impunity&#39;? Is there any animal that looks similar?</p>
<p class="orv_line">While the group was breathing a sigh of relief, Killer King, the only one among them who had not lost his mask, approached me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;By the way, you were lucky this time. You know that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded and said,</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The &#39;original owner&#39; of the story did not intervene.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason why this 「staging」 collapsed faster than expected was because the original owner of the story, the 「Pig in the Brick House」, did not help us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the &#39;Pig In The Brick House&#39; had intervened on stage, the fight would not have ended so easily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, even if that happened, it wasn&#39;t the worst.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if the &#39;pig&#39; won and the existing narrative was strengthened, we were fighting on the &#39;pig&#39; side anyway. Even if I couldn&#39;t write a new story, I would have benefited from it in some way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, I was curious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why didn&#39;t the &#39;Pig in the Brick House&#39; intervene on stage? If I think about it, it was a constellation that had been watching me from the beginning of the scenarios.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah, ahhh… I know what you guys are doing!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We’re all going to die! We’re all going to die!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">After the scenario was over, the prisoners hiding under the table came out one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The other Zodiac signs will not forgive Zone 13.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why, why are you doing this—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled bitterly as I looked at the terrified prisoners.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since I couldn&#39;t fill up after the first drink, I didn&#39;t have high expectations. Because people who are stuck in this scenario are afraid of change.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But not all incarnations were like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The crane owner was looking at me with an expression of disbelief.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you say Kim Dokja…?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some stories are unchanging prisons.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A prison that restricts existence to a set frame, repeats the same schedule, and transforms it into mere material.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the prisoners saw with their own eyes that the prison could be broken.</p>
[Your new &#39;story&#39; begins to influence &#39;Zone 13&#39;.]</p></div>
[The name of &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; is starting to become known at the &#39;Recycling Center&#39;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s enough for now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stood side by side with Killer King and watched the beastmen for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The Demon World scenario would have been similar to this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I guess so.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s my favorite scenery.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before we knew it, Ye Hyunwoo, who had changed his mask, came towards us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Killer King opened his mouth, his eyes widened  as if he was dissatisfied with Hyunwoo standing next to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi. But is it okay? You can continue to work under &#39;that name&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;7th Apostle. This guy is Kim Dokja—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m asking Cheon Inho now, not Dokja-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked into Ye Hyunwoo’s clever eyes beyond the mask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, there was once a problem with Ye Hyunwoo over using the name Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you uncomfortable?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, not really. I admit it now. Inho-ssi is the one closest to that name among us. However.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I thought I knew what he was worried about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; is more sensitive to names than anything else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That is, if I were to impersonate Kim Dokja—</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If this continues, all the stories Inho-ssi builds will become &#39;Kim Dokja’s&#39; stories.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was a sharp point.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s okay. It was intentional.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You did that on purpose?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Actually, I had a crucial reason why I impersonated &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; when I entered the &#39;Recycling Center&#39;.</p>
[A new story begins to be recorded under the name of &#39;Kim Dokja&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Along with the message, the newly germinated power of the story floated within me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The name hasn&#39;t been decided yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A story that has not been lost.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, is it because I am also the &#39;youngest Kim Dokja&#39;? Part of the story was absorbed into me, but the rest slowly rose upward through the ceiling of the Recycling Center.</p>
[Your story will be shared with your sponsor.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a small sense of relief as I saw the tail of the story moving away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thank god. He&#39;s still there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;A similar thing happened in the demon world. Do you remember?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You mean when Kim Dokja impersonated Yoo Jonghyuk?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">All stories have a main character and are written around that main character.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While I am impersonating Kim Dokja, the stories I have accumulated will continue to raise Kim Dokja&#39;s status.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The created story will make Kim Dokja&#39;s name known, and people will call Kim Dokja&#39;s name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And Kim Dokja will also hear that name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait a minute, it can’t be—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I thought about it for a long time. But no matter how much I thought about it, it seemed like this was the only way.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I liked this 41st round. So I hope this world line does not perish.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, I know that if I protect this world line, other world lines may be destroyed. A much bigger disaster may occur than what happened in the main story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the tragedy has not yet been written and the story continues.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So I can do it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just what I need.</p>
「A being who can &#39;reread&#39; all the endings of this story.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Someone who can turn my &#39;square circle&#39; into reality.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I intend to  bring &#39;The Oldest Dream&#39; on this world line.&quot;</p>
