<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Belonging to the planet Kronos.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Prince of the Imyuntar race and the first wolf—'Lycaon Isparang'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This wolf, who appears as a guide in the 'fifth scenario' in the main story, was a character whose whereabouts were unknown after clashing with another guide, 'Antinus'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is it really that 'Lycaon'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">After the identity of the 'God of the Other World' was revealed, the party members expressed their surprise in different ways.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi, who could not join in on the surprise, asked hesitantly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who is Lycaon?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You know, the guide from the 'Disaster Scenario'. The wolf from the meteorite."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, that guy… wasn’t he dead?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There was no mention of his death. His whereabouts became unknown after that."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. That’s true, but…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo, who was shaking his head at Killer King’s words, glanced at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Dokja-ssi, how did you know that 'Lycaon' had become a God of Another World?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Indeed, I thought Ye Hyunwoo would ask. Even though he has read it less times than the other apostles, he is the most quick-witted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo even called me 'Dokja-ssi'. That probably means that he expects this answer to be like 'Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I wasn’t even sure. It was a gamble."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not surprisingly, there was no additional setting or follow-up story regarding Lycaon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are bound to be characters whose importance decreases as the scenario progresses, and Lycaon was also a character who naturally existed in that way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, I did not mention Lycaon as a candidate for 'God of the Other World' without thinking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It just occurred to me. Perhaps among the people we know, there are individuals who have evolved into 'Outer Gods'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Many of the 'Gods of the Other World' in the main story were left without seeing the 'end' of the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Most of them lose their ego and become 'nameless', but sometimes there are those who maintain their ego outside the scenario and increase their power by becoming Outer Gods.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, 'Asmodeus' who appeared in this round was of that type.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So that's what I thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps among the characters who are not fully described in the main story, there may be someone who has become a 'God from Another World'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It was a gamble with very low odds."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The odds were low.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, this was the 'Recycling Center', and I thought there was a high possibility that that kind of probability would have a positive effect.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And above all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There were two alternatives besides Lycaon."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Three precautions. As expected of Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who were the other two?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"As you know, among the gods of another world, there is another being related to 'wolves'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I said those words, I looked down at little Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this because the previous battle was too much?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Or did he get sick from eating dirt? Yoo Joonghyuk was lying on the floor, completely exhausted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I put a thin blanket over him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"'Kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk' also appeared in the main story."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The second 'Outer God' I was going to call did not have a story related to 'wolves'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there was a scene in the main story where he was compared to a 'wolf', so I thought it might be possible to call him that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hmm. Do you mean 'King of the Lone Wolves'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But would the 'being' respond to the summons?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The probability would have been low. In fact, we haven’t even seen him in this Round."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The second 'Outer God' I considered was a 'Secretive Plotter'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the 'Secretive Plotter' had reached his ◾️◾️ and crossed into a completely different world, so there was no certainty that he would respond to the call.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then what about the third?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The third is..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked up at the sky. In fact, the third response probability was as low as the second.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The third one was even less related to 'wolves'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, this is a world where「a man who eats eight meals a day」is recognized as a 'pig'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wolf ears headband. Do you remember?"</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The man wearing the wolf ears headband may also be recognized as a 'wolf'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo, who was thinking about something, opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wolf ears? When they went to the amusement park in Oz…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, that’s right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a world where all of Kim Dokja's memories become stories, the story of going to the amusement park with Han Sooyoung would certainly survive as fragments of stories.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A Constellation whose modifier has not yet been revealed is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even if he is not a deity from another world,  Kim Dokja, who possesses that 'story fragment', exists.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Kim Dokja is a being with a modifier like the 'Demon King of Salvation'…</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Sub-scenario—The Three Little Pigs' has ended.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, a scenario ending message appeared.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[500 recycled coins were obtained as a reward.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have cleared the scenario in a way no one has tried before!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your achievements will transform the very foundation of the scenario!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'The Three Little Pigs' loses influence in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The surrounding scenery shimmered and the night began to fade.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did my companions' faces brighten one by one, as if they realized it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The event scenario has been lifted and 'wolves' can no longer threaten us. Because the 'wolf' has just joined our side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If we’re going to fight the &lt;Zodiac&gt; in the future, we’ll need that guy’s power."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked back at Lycaon, who was standing about ten steps away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein asked with a slightly frightened expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is it okay? He’s a God from Another World."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There is nothing to be afraid of as a God from Another World. Even in the main story, they negotiated with a God from Another World."</p>
<p class="orv_line">From earlier, Lycaon had been muttering something at the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps he is exchanging messages with the Management Bureau regarding the 'Otherworld Covenant', or perhaps he is negotiating with the 'Recycling Center'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sighed lightly and looked back at my companions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"And here. These are the 'masks' we recovered earlier."</p>
<p class="orv_line">One of the main purposes of this 'scenario' was to obtain new 'masks' for the group to use.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah. When did this happen—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a mask obtained from previously deceased wolf incarnations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you sure you don’t mind if we take it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">When Dansu ahjussi lowered his head as if he was sorry, the other party members also lowered their heads as if they were being shamed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein said in a trembling voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I-I really couldn’t be of any help."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, you all did well."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly looked back at my companions and spoke emphatically.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the party members who recovered the masks put them on one by one, their bodies, which had been transformed, began to return to their original state.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead, faces that reflected the characteristics of their time as prisoners appeared on the surface of the mask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein is a squirrel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi is a turtle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cha Yerin is a snail.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo is a panda.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, the 'mask' seemed to reflect the user's original characteristics.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, why am I still thinking, 'I’m free from impunity'? Is there any animal that looks similar?</p>
<p class="orv_line">While the group was breathing a sigh of relief, Killer King, the only one among them who had not lost his mask, approached me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"By the way, you were lucky this time. You know that."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded and said,</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The 'original owner' of the story did not intervene."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason why this「staging」collapsed faster than expected was because the original owner of the story, the 「Pig in the Brick House」, did not help us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the 'Pig In The Brick House' had intervened on stage, the fight would not have ended so easily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, even if that happened, it wasn't the worst.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if the 'pig' won and the existing narrative was strengthened, we were fighting on the 'pig' side anyway. Even if I couldn't write a new story, I would have benefited from it in some way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, I was curious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why didn't the 'Pig in the Brick House' intervene on stage? If I think about it, it was a Constellation that had been watching me from the beginning of the scenarios.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah, ahhh… I know what you guys are doing!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We’re all going to die! We’re all going to die!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">After the scenario was over, the prisoners hiding under the table came out one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The other Zodiac signs will not forgive Zone 13."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why, why are you doing this—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled bitterly as I looked at the terrified prisoners.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since I couldn't fill up after the first drink, I didn't have high expectations. Because people who are stuck in this scenario are afraid of change.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But not all incarnations were like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The crane owner was looking at me with an expression of disbelief.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you say Kim Dokja…?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some stories are unchanging prisons.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A prison that restricts existence to a set frame, repeats the same schedule, and transforms it into mere material.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the prisoners saw with their own eyes that the prison could be broken.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your new 'story' begins to influence 'Zone 13'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The name of 'Kim Dokja' is starting to become known at the 'Recycling Center'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">That's enough for now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stood side by side with Killer King and watched the beastmen for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The Demon World scenario would have been similar to this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I guess so."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s my favorite scenery."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before we knew it, Ye Hyunwoo, who had changed his mask, came towards us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Killer King opened his mouth, his eyes widened  as if he was dissatisfied with Hyunwoo standing next to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi. But is it okay? You can continue to work under 'that name'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"7th Apostle. This guy is Kim Dokja—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m asking Cheon Inho now, not Dokja-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked into Ye Hyunwoo’s clever eyes beyond the mask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, there was once a problem with Ye Hyunwoo over using the name Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you uncomfortable?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, not really. I admit it now. Inho-ssi is the one closest to that name among us. However."</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I thought I knew what he was worried about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; is more sensitive to names than anything else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That is, if I were to impersonate Kim Dokja—</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If this continues, all the stories Inho-ssi builds will become 'Kim Dokja’s' stories."</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was a sharp point.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s okay. It was intentional."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You did that on purpose?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Actually, I had a crucial reason why I impersonated 'Kim Dokja' when I entered the 'Recycling Center'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new story begins to be recorded under the name of 'Kim Dokja'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Along with the message, the newly germinated power of the story floated within me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The name hasn't been decided yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A story that has not been lost.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, is it because I am also the 'youngest Kim Dokja'? Part of the story was absorbed into me, but the rest slowly rose upward through the ceiling of the Recycling Center.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your story will be shared with your sponsor.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a small sense of relief as I saw the tail of the story moving away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thank god. He's still there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A similar thing happened in the demon world. Do you remember?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You mean when Kim Dokja impersonated Yoo Joonghyuk?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">All stories have a main character and are written around that main character.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While I am impersonating Kim Dokja, the stories I have accumulated will continue to raise Kim Dokja's status.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The created story will make Kim Dokja's name known, and people will call Kim Dokja's name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And Kim Dokja will also hear that name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait a minute, it can’t be—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I thought about it for a long time. But no matter how much I thought about it, it seemed like this was the only way."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I liked this 41st round. So I hope this world line does not perish.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, I know that if I protect this world line, other world lines may be destroyed. A much bigger disaster may occur than what happened in the main story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the tragedy has not yet been written and the story continues.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So I can do it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just what I need.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 A being who can 'reread' all the endings of this story. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Someone who can turn my 'square circle' into reality.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I intend to bring 'The Oldest Dream' on this world line."</p>
