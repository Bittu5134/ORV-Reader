            <div class="orv_title"><h1>651 Episode 19 People of the Past (3)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">I thought about my parents.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I was young, I was given homework to draw a picture under the theme of &#39;family&#39; at school.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remember it as being a pretty embarrassing homework assignment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because at that time, I was not good at drawing people&#39;s faces. When I tried to think of someone&#39;s face, strangely, only a pale mosaic face came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So instead of my parents, I drew myself standing under the deep dark night sky.</p>
「&quot;Why did Hakhyun draw only himself?&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When the teacher asked me that, I replied that I drew my parents.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking back now, it might have been the manifestation of my literary talent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A deep, warm night sky with a few twinkling stars</p>
<p class="orv_line">A cozy darkness that seems to embrace me no matter what I do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although there are no detailed shapes or faces, the people who were clearly there and cared for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking back, I wonder if it wasn&#39;t because of my parents that I first started writing a novel.</p>
「&quot;Why do stories exist?&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">To that question, my mother replied:</p>
「&quot;Hmm. Stories are for world peace.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A story for world peace.</p>
「&quot;If everyone would read the stories and talk about the stories, there would be no wars or strife.&quot;」</p></div>
「&quot;Why?&quot;」</p></div>
「&quot;Because the story is fictional.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">For the world to be peaceful, everyone must read novels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first I didn&#39;t understand what that meant.</p>
「&quot;Lee Hakhyun. Don&#39;t play with your phone, come here.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But going to school and meeting my friends</p>
「&quot;Why do you keep talking to the dog?&quot;」</p></div>
「&quot;But isn’t Lee Hakhyun also a bit gloomy?&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Being bullied for not bullying someone else together.</p>
「&quot;Lee Hakhyun. I&#39;ll have to bring your parents tomorrow.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As I listened to the teacher&#39;s criticism for not clearing up the misunderstanding even though I hadn&#39;t done anything wrong, I understood my mother&#39;s words for the first time.</p>
「&quot;Hakhyun&#39;s parents are a bit peculiar.&quot;」</p></div>
「&quot;Tsk. Anyway, son and parents are the same.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">People really like stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a place where an incident does not exist, they create an incident, exaggerate it, and even distort it to develop a story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They are enjoying the process of someone in front of them getting hurt and falling apart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And all of that is quickly forgotten.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps it was at that time that I began to write novels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead of hating people, let&#39;s write novels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Let&#39;s write really interesting novels, and let the whole world talk about my novels all the time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wrote and wrote like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, around the age of 23, I made my debut.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I visited my parents with the news of my debut, the first expression my parents made.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My memories were hazy like a pale mosaic, but the emotion contained in that expression came to mind clearly.</p>
「&quot;Yes, that&#39;s how it happened.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Why?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The faces of my parents who read my novel looked somewhat sad.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Naturally, I knew they would be happy, but I was confused. What did I do wrong? Did something in my novel make them sad?</p>
<p class="orv_line">My parents hugged me silently. I couldn&#39;t understand that feeling, so I left the house that way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s funny when I think about it now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps my parents were worried about how I would make a living as a pure literature writer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As a result, I met Ji Eunyoo and became a web novel writer, so my parents&#39; concerns may have been correct.</p>
「&quot;Author-nim. You can&#39;t start the intro like this.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyoo was a patient editor.</p>
「&quot;What if you unravel the main character’s past for such a long time?&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The correction was basic, and she spared no criticism when the development was strange or when there was an utterance that did not suit the character.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hundreds of manuscripts were rejected, and dozens of other works were returned for thousands of reasons.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wrote it, and she edited it. So one or two works piled up.</p>
「&quot;Writer! It&#39;s done! It&#39;s a success!&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">One day, a story came to us.</p>
「&quot;Did you know? This is the first time! It&#39;s the first time in our management that we won a promotion like this!&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was her first successful work that she and I created together.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even Ji Eunyoo, who has been calm throughout the writing, couldn&#39;t hide her excitement in front of her sales index she had never seen before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">On the day the work began to be paid for, we sat side by side in the management chair with the lights off and read readers&#39; comments together.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not all of the comments were comments of support, but we were happy that day.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although I didn&#39;t know it, I must have been as trembling as Kim Dokja at the moment he first became a Constellation.</p>
「&quot;Editor-nim. By the way.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But why am I remembering the story of that day now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Ji Eunyoo advised, it would be difficult to talk about this for a long time.</p>
「&quot;People keep asking if Kim Dokja is me. What does that mean?&quot;」</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&quot;Huh!&quot;</p>
<p>When I jumped up with a strange scream, my surroundings were covered in pitch black darkness.</p>
<p>I had a strange dream.</p>
<p>I think it was a dream about my parents and Ji Eunyoo.</p>
<p>As I relaxed my shoulders lightly and looked around me, I felt a heavy sensation in my right thigh.</p>
<p>When I turned on the light on my smartphone, I saw Shin Yoosoung leaned over who fell asleep.</p>
<p>Several memories came one after another.</p>
<p>In order to collect Sangpyeong Tongbo, I entered the &#39;Field of Nagak&#39;, and met Shin Yoosoung there.</p>
<p>There, I helped Shin Yoosoung to deal with the Ancient Nagak.</p>
<p>I used [Enhance Sentence] to tame the Ancient Nagak. I even remember that I [incited] myself as Shin Yoosoung&#39;…</p>
<p>My memory after that wasn&#39;t clear.</p>
<p>Is it a side effect of [Incite]?</p>
<p>&quot;Shin Yoosoung, are you okay?&quot;</p>
<p>When I lightly shook Shin Yoosoung’s shoulder, the child quickly opened her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, you&#39;re awake...!&quot;</p>
<p>Looking at Shin Yoosoung&#39;s smiling expression, I felt chills.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Fortunately, that feeling quickly dissipated.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Are you uninjured?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, thank you!&quot;</p>
<p>Fortunately, it seems that we cleared the &#39;Field of Nagak&#39; without much trouble.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the message log was pushed back for a long time.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[You are the first to hunt more than 500 &#39;Nagaks&#39;!]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Cleared the 1-person dungeon.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[You have obtained 2 tokens as a basic reward.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[We have acquired 8 additional Sangpyeong Tongbo as a mass slaughter bonus for Nagak.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[As a special reward, you acquired the exclusive skill &#39;Breath&#39;.]</p>
<p>Exclusive Skill [Breath].</p>
<p>Although it is a full-time skill that makes you hold your breath for up to 30 minutes with a single breath, it is a useful skill when you have to go through a contaminated area or engage in underwater battles.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[You have succeeded in hunting down the &#39;Hidden Boss&#39; in the 1-person dungeon.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[You will receive an additional reward.]</p>
<p>Even got an additional reward by hunting the hidden boss of the &#39;one-person dungeon - Ancient Nargak&#39;</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Obtained the &#39;Provocation Fire Flute&#39;.]</p>
<p>The flute of provocation. An item that greatly reduces the enemy&#39;s mental strength when used, and gathers scattered enemies in one place.</p>
<p>I honestly don&#39;t know where to use this.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not like I&#39;m strong, and if I had to drive normal monsters to one place, I&#39;d die like a dog.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll have to give it to Kyung Sein later.</p>
<p>The messages weren&#39;t over.</p>
<p>There was still a bounty scenario left.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Sub scenario &#39;Precious Hair&#39; is done!]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[You have obtained 2,000 coins as a reward.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Additionally, when you offer &#39;Ancient Nagak’s Meat&#39;, &#39;Prisoner of the Golden Headband&#39; will give you a special reward.]</p>
<p>Come to think of it, this scenario ends when you give that constellation the ancient Nagak’s meat.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Prisoner of the Golden Headband&#39; is expecting the &#39;Ancient Nagak’s Meat&#39;.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Abyssal Black Flame Dragon&#39; looks at the &#39;Prisoner of the Golden Headband&#39; pathetically.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Prisoner of the Golden Headband&#39; says he would like you to cook it for him if possible.]</p>
<p>I hesitated for a moment, then muttered into the air.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s going to take a few days to do it. Is that  okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Prisoner of the Golden Headband&#39; says he can wait that long.]</p>
<p>This bought me some time.</p>
<p>By the way, when I got out of the dungeon, the Ancient Nagaks disappeared, so how do I consecrate the meat of the ancient horns?</p>
<p>While I was lost in my thoughts, Shin Yoosoung brushed her butt and stood up.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Ahjussi. Thanks to that, I can now do it for one person.&quot;</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung smiled brightly as she looked down at Sangpyeong Tongbo, which she had acquired herself.</p>
<p>But I couldn&#39;t laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you going back to your original group?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah yes… I decided to do that with the adults...&quot;</p>
<p>The reason Shin Yoosoung entered the &#39;One-Man Dungeon&#39; was to prove her worth to the adults in her group.</p>
<p>Now that the proof is complete, Shin Yoosoung will be able to become an official member of the group.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m not asking the grown-ups&#39; opinions, but Shin Yoosoung&#39;s intentions. Do you really want to be in that group?&quot;</p>
<p>A smart Shin Yoosoung would have understood the meaning of my question. However, some children are so smart that they come up with answers that others don&#39;t even have in mind.</p>
<p>&quot;The adults in the group said. They say that they don&#39;t discriminate based on their age, but if they have ability, they&#39;re people who treat them as much as they have ability-&quot;</p>
<p>I know what you want to say, but I don&#39;t need to hear more.</p>
<p>&quot;Shin Yoosoung.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would you like to come with me if it&#39;s okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung looked up at me with her eyes wide open. I gave the child enough time to think. After a while, Shin Yoosoung asked in a small voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, of course.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I won&#39;t be of much help.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If it wasn’t for Shin Yoosoung, I would be dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That helped me…&quot;</p>
<p>Shin Yoo-seung bit her lip and murmured while lowering her head.</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#39;t even know who I am...&quot;</p>
<p>What drove this child to this extent?</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「&quot;Something like a devil.&quot;」</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「&quot;These days, young children are more toxic. They are kids who survived after killing people in the first scenario.&quot;」</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「&quot;If you can’t trust her, she should be useful. Put her in the dungeon. If she survives, let&#39;s take her.&quot;」</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「&quot;Poisonous things should be caught properly from an early age.&quot;」</p>
<p>Even without [The Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint], I could read the words echoing in the child&#39;s head.</p>
<p>I opened my mouth as if in protest.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know what kind of person Shin Yoosoung is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How...&quot;</p>
<p>If you ask me how I know, there are no words to explain.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「&quot;Ahjussi.&quot;」</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「&quot;I will not give up. Just like Ahjussi saved me time and time again.&quot;」</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「&quot;My name is Shin Yoosung. Shin Yoosung from &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;.&quot;」</p>
<p>I&#39;ve read and rewrote a lot of sentences about you, I can answer that.</p>
<p>But that wouldn&#39;t be an appropriate thing for Shin Yoosung now.</p>
<p>Who is in front of me right now is not &#39;Shin Yoosung in the 3rd round&#39;, but &#39;Shin Yoosung in the 41st round&#39;.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「&quot;What were we to the captain?&quot;」</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「&quot;I hate you for living alone in the world.&quot;」</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「&quot;There is only one thing I can tell you now. The captain can&#39;t save anyone.&quot;」</p>
<p>She was the one who followed Yoo Joonghyuk more than anyone else.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why she couldn&#39;t stand the feeling of betrayal.</p>
<p>She is someone who has grown with hatred by wandering around the world lines for thousands of years.</p>
<p>A person who appeared as a disaster in the third round.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「&quot;Baat!&quot;」</p>
<p>The person who became Kim Dokja&#39;s daughter.</p>
<p>The person who was reincarnated as a dokkaebi and told the story of &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; to &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「However, it was a story that hadn&#39;t happened yet.」</p>
<p>That&#39;s why I know Shin Yoosung well, but I don&#39;t know much about Shin Yoosoung in front of me.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if I don&#39;t know who you are, I&#39;m going to trust you.&quot;</p>
<p>So that was all I could promise.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung looked up at me blankly, then she averted her gaze and said:</p>
<p>&quot;… I think I can trust you too.&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The character Shin Yoosoung shows strong trust in you.]</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung, who had been twitching her little hand for a while, asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Then… Do you have a group too?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would you like to join my group?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That, is that okay? But to join the group, you have to get permission from the king…&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am the king.&quot;</p>
<p>At my words, Shin Yoosoung sighed and took a small breath. Then she took a couple of steps away from me and started shaking her shoulders.</p>
<p>I know very well what kind of being the &#39;king&#39; of the last group was.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing to be nervous about. As you can see, I’m just an ordinary ahjussi. I just picked up a flag by accident.&quot;</p>
<p>If Cheon Inho looked a little nicer, my words would be more persuasive.</p>
<p>I used my narrow eyes to draw as good an arc as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;It’s scary because you smile like that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can I really join?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure.&quot;</p>
<p>When I agreed, Shin Yoosoung, who was briefly thinking about something, said in a determined voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Then I want to join.&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Incarnation &#39;Shin Yoosoung&#39; has become a member of your group.]</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t turn a blind eye to Shin Yoosoung…</p>
<p>I may be beaten to death by Yoo Jonghyuk of the 41st round later, but I believe this is the right decision for now.</p>
<p>&quot;The other group members haven&#39;t joined yet, so it looks like we&#39;ll both be four for the time being.&quot;</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung nodded her head vigorously as if she liked it.</p>
<p>After clearing the &#39;One-Man Dungeon&#39;, what&#39;s left is the &#39;Sangpyeong Tongbo&#39; we collected to enter the &#39;field of the Big Dipper&#39;.</p>
<p>Looking for a seat in the lobby, I thought for a moment about Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p>This is the 41st round not recorded in &#39;Ways of Survival&#39;.</p>
<p>In this round, Shin Yoosoung, the &#39;Disaster of Floods&#39; who went to Kronos won’t appear.</p>
<p>Then, who will be the disaster of the &#39;fifth scenario&#39;?</p>
<p>As soon as the 10 Sangpyeong Tonggi were inserted into the entrance of the lobby, a dim light began to permeate the lobby.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m going to enter the Hidden Dungeon. It could be dangerous, would you mind?&quot;</p>
<p>Since the entrance to the National Palace Museum had collapsed anyway, I couldn’t try to escape.</p>
<p>I had no choice but to clear the dungeon.</p>
<p>If even one person clears this dungeon, the remaining members will be automatically summoned out of the museum.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s okay. I was prepared for that much.&quot;</p>
<p>As I looked at the child who spoke resolutely, a corner of my chest was sore.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t wait any longer and used the Sangpyeong tongbos.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[You can advance to the hidden chapter by using 10 prize reports.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Would you like to enter the hidden chapter, &#39;Field of the Big Dipper&#39;?]</p>
<p>&quot;Enter.&quot;</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t find any traces of other kings either in the National Museum of Korea or in the &#39;Field of Nagaks&#39;.</p>
<p>In other words, other kings have already collected 10 pieces of Sangpyeong Tongbo and entered the field of the Big Dipper.</p>
<p>&quot;The culprit who destroyed the museum must also be in this dungeon.&quot;</p>
<p>I blinked and my vision wavered.</p>
<p>I imagined the scenery that would soon unfold.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「The white lobby has been transformed into a wide, open waiting room. There were seven doors at the end of the waiting room.」</p>
<p>After a while, an open waiting room appeared as explained in the main story when reading.</p>
<p>However, there was one thing that was different from the main story.</p>
<p>With a cool sense of tension, I narrowed my eyes even more.</p>
<p>In the &#39;Field of the Big Dipper&#39;, we have collect all the star jewels scattered across the seven gates to summon the &#39;Death Sword&#39;.</p>
<p>So the waiting room had to have a total of seven doors according to the number of star jewels.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「But now, there was only one door visible in the waiting room.」</p>
<p>The scenario had changed.</p>
<p></p>
