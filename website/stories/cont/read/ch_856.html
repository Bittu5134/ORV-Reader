        <article class="orv_main">
            <div class="orv_title"><h1>856 Episode 46 Big Joke (7)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho started turning the pages one by one. Even though it was his first story, he turned the pages easily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It couldn't be otherwise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because the story contained all the scenarios he had experienced.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「It's a dokkaebi. Someone said that the moment it first appeared.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The more he read, the more strange the feeling he had. Even though he knew that he had no choice but to read this story to the end, he felt like he would never be able to turn back once he finished it.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Are you going to keep reading?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Dokkaebi King seemed to know that fact as well.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[After you finish reading it, you will never be able to return to the world you knew.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I wonder if I have a choice."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho answered with his characteristically squinted eyes. And then he began to read the story with his eyes even narrowed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the story, a man he knew well appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A man who had been his rival throughout his life in this world. Only to kill him, to accomplish what he could not, Cheon Inho lived this life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He wanted to mock his splendid justice, and he also wanted to prove that he could see the end of this world without such a noble life.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's funny. How many worlds have you led to destruction just to see the ending you want?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">He turned the pages with trembling hands. Cheon Inho’s shoulders quietly shook as he watched the 'Supreme King' he knew speak, act, and live there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Next time, it wouldn't be bad to have the Ten Evils as colleagues.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because of Yoo Joonghyuk's words, he revived the Ten Evils and brought them in as his colleagues. He tried to prove that what was possible in the next round was possible in this round as well. He joined hands with the constellations, deceived and betrayed them. He endured life while enduring plausible nicknames like 'Evil Sophist' and 'The One Who Deceived the Stars.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's okay to be a coward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was okay to be called evil.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because that was him. He thought that if he could survive to the end and achieve the final victory, it wouldn’t matter, if he could prove himself that way, it would be good.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what is this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Am I in this story?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In front of the story with the seven-letter title, Cheon Inho felt like all his past stories were crumbling from the corners.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He didn’t need to hear the explanation from the Dokkaebi King. Because the moment he turned the page, his name appeared there.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"I see. My name is Cheon Inho."」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho laughed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this really 'me'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">What do you know about me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">How could you describe me like that, knowing who I am and what I’m thinking?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「I could see what was going on. Cheon Inho’s smiling face was visible behind the people. His lips were speaking.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'Choose.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will you share food and become a hero? Or will you monopolize food all by yourself and become a villain?」</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah, hahaha."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is such a sloppy villain really 'me'? He turned the page over and over again, thinking that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, his eyes stopped at one sentence.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Huh, huh… Yes, you…"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The guy couldn't finish his words. That was because Jung Heewon, who appeared from behind, pierced Cheon Inho's face from the crown down.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho read his own death over and over again. It was a proper and accurate death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho, who had been reading that sentence over and over with eyes full of disbelief, slowly raised his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is this all there is to my story?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Yes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"This is not me."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[But it is you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I am here."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[No, you are there.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Dokkaebi King spread his index and middle fingers toward the empty space. Then, a cigarette magically appeared between them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Dokkaebi King silently lit the cigarette and spoke.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[In this universe, only what is recorded becomes the truth. You here will not be recorded anywhere. No one wants your story, and no one wants to read it.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Dokkaebi King added, glancing at the book in Cheon Inho's hand.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[But that story is different. That story was chosen by the 'Oldest Dream' and was completed. Existing as a character written in that story is all the choices you have.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I decide how I will exist."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Dokkaebi King looked down at Cheon Inho for a moment as if he felt sorry for him.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Little incarnation. How much do you know about yourself? Do you remember your parents?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Of course, I know everything."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Do you remember your parents?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"You're asking the obvious. My parents—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho stopped talking until that point. Why on earth couldn't he? The words that seemed like they would flow out like a stream of water stopped inside him.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「He didn't remember his parents.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Following that, a shiver ran through his head like lightning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And after a while, a single sentence appeared on a wall far away.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Cheon Inho was an orphan.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Was that his thought? Or was it a setting someone had just made up?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho pursed his lips in confusion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't have parents. Because I was an orphan."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[That's right.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you know?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Yes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Because someone made me like that?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Yes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Who is that?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This universe.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho and the Dokkaebi King were silent for a moment. The two beings who lived different stories but were described in the same story stared at the darkness of the universe where the stars had gone out for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who is Kim Dokja?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The symbol of the 'Oldest Dream'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Is he the 'main character' of this story?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Now the entire universe was reorganized around him.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"What's the reason?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I don't know that either. I'm just a character in this story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Why isn't the Supreme King the main character? How many times has that guy regressed?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[1,864 times.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"He acted so great to me, and then he regressed so many times before he finally got to the end?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Dokkaebi King did not answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho started to giggle. His laughter sounded sad, resigned, and filled with terrifying anger. Then, at one moment, Cheon Inho's laughter suddenly stopped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I have decided on a wish."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho stood up, holding the page he was reading tightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will end this universe."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I will take revenge on the being who designed this universe, on that guy named Kim Dokja, and on the 'Oldest Dream' that dreams of this universe."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I can't do that.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Didn't you say you would grant me anything?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your request is beyond my ability to grant.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Is it okay to be just that?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Yes, that's all. All you and I can do is read the story to the end. And in that story, we can realize and accept how insignificant we are. You should be grateful that you have this opportunity. Most incarnations are not even given the chance to know the truth of the world.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you think I came all this way to know this truth?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[But that's all you can know.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I once had a similar conversation with Hermes."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Hermes?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"He said that even if I reached the 'end of everything', I would never be able to see the scenery of the world I wanted. Because—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The pages of the book were torn slightly by Cheon Inho's forceful hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm not 'Supreme King Yoo Joonghyuk'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A tale flowed out from the torn pages of the book.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A story not written in 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Cheon Inho's own tale.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Hermes, what does it mean that I can't see the end of the world?"」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">During the conquest of <Olympus>, Cheon Inho accidentally connected to the joint network created by <Olympus>.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There, he came face to face with the artificial intelligence that controlled the network built by <Olympus>—or perhaps a new intelligence, as it were—Hermes, the true form of the 'Master of Skywalk'.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「[That's exactly right. Evil sophist. According to my 'big data', you won't be able to reach the end of the world even if you clear the final scenario.]」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"So what does that mean?"」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"[Because it's just written that way.]"」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"It's written?"」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「[Have you heard of something called 'Revelation'?]」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Hermes told him about the true nature of the 'Revelation'. In this world, there is a huge 'wall' with all the sentences written on it, and all the Revelation flows out from that 'wall'.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「[But the Revelation has been cut off for a while now.]」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"It's cut off? Why?"」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「[Probably because there is no reason for the 'Revelation' to exist in this world anymore.]」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The timing of the Revelation's disappearance was after the death of the Supreme King Yoo Joonghyuk. As if there was no need for any more sentences in the world where he disappeared.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「[Cheon Inho, I think this way. The Revelation is actually a complete story, and at the center of that story is 'Supreme King Yoo Joonghyuk.]」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Hermes's reasoning was correct. The result was the book he was holding in his hands right now.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「"Hermes. If you help me, Olympus will be destroyed. Why did you decide to help me?"」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「[Well. Maybe… I also got bored with the 'Revelation'.]」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho laughed while holding the end of the world that Hermes had wanted to see so much in his hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I can't admit it."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[What are you talking about?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Instead of answering, Cheon Inho looked at the huge wall they had turned away from.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Final Wall' where all the Revelation was written.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What is beyond that 'wall'? I will go beyond the wall."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can't go. You are a being that 'can't' do that.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Dokkaebi King let out a deep sigh and said.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[I understand your feelings, but your story ends here. You are destined not to be recorded on the 'Final Wall'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Is that what you decided? Or is it what is written on the 'Final Wall'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho pulled out the sword at his waist with one arm. As the [Black Heavenly Sword] with its pitch-black blade let out a strange cry, the Dokkaebi King's expression hardened.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Do I really have to decide your end like that?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Dokkaebi King waved his hand lightly as if he had already read all of his stories. Then, Cheon Inho's knees magically gave up with a 'thud'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can't beat me.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho's specialty was 'information warfare'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Based on a tactical strategy. So it was natural that he couldn't use any force against the 'Dokkaebi King' he was seeing for the first time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, at that moment, with a slap, the 'Dokkaebi King's' finger was cut off.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[How—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When the Dokkaebi King hurriedly looked around, Cheon Inho was already gone. When he turned around, Cheon Inho was dragging his knees and had reached the 'Final Wall'. It was the application of the ability of the Ten Evils, Ye Hyunwoo, the 'Disappearing One'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You didn't see it properly. How did I clear the 'Final Chapter'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A golden light flowed out from Cheon Inho's half-opened eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive attribute, 'New Intelligence', is activating.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">New Intelligence. The sum of big data created by <Olympus>. Hermes's exclusive attribute, which collects all the data in this world and makes a kind of [Future Simulation] based on the data possible. Cheon Inho repeated countless 'simulations' using the data collected by 'new intelligence'. Just like Yoo Joonghyuk repeated regressions, he also repeated simulations a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand times in order to clear 'just once'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this way, Cheon Inho found the only way to clear the final chapter, and was now here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't need to fight you. Because what I want—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho's palm met the wall with a sound of tsutsutsu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's beyond this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">With sparks flying fiercely, Cheon Inho felt the wall pushing him away. If this continued, his entire body would be burned black. Even though he knew this fact well, Cheon Inho did not take his hand off the wall.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.???', is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Wall. I."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because, he was the best 'instigator' in this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The sentence written on the last wall."</p>
<p class="orv_line">With that declaration, Cheon Inho felt his body being sucked into the wall. The Dokkaebi King's screams faded away, and his body, which had turned into a story, instantly seeped into the wall.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「That's how 'Cheon Inho' became a part of the story.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When he came to his senses again, he realized that he had entered the wall. His heart pounded, and he was out of breath with an unknown joy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I have come, Supreme King."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He would finally be able to meet Yoo Joonghyuk again. Or maybe he would be able to meet the being who dreamed of this damned world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oldest Dream!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">But no one answered his voice. He slowly blinked his eyes and saw the surrounding scenery.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The endless snowfield spread out before his eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho hesitated and carefully took a step. He took one step, then two.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were no footprints left. As if he wasn’t even worthy of leaving footprints in this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho quietly looked down at the snowfield and began to laugh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is there really no one?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A world of nothingness. Trapped in the margins beyond the walls where time and space do not exist, he walked through the world. He walked for a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He walked for a day, two days.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Three days, four days. A week.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A month, two months.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A year. Two years. No, maybe,</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「How long have I walked?」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, isn’t all of this a mirage? This is a world between sentences. A place where a hundred or a thousand years can pass with a single sentence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thinking like that, Cheon Inho,</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Everything just felt like a big joke.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Was the Dokkaebi King right? Was this really his fate? Was this the end given to him, this terrible journey of quietly dying without being written down anywhere or remembered by anyone, just wandering around in search of a margin where he could be buried?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho opened his eyes and looked up at the sky. In the midst of his deep sense of humiliation, Cheon Inho tried to say something for the last time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Isn't it me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that was all he could say, and after saying those words, he realized that maybe that was really his desire.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe he wanted to be the main character. Maybe that's why he wanted to meet the Supreme King again and make fun of this world. Maybe he wanted someone to dream of him as a villain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So in fact.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Maybe he also had a story he wanted to leave behind.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sky of the white night. It was then that a star twinkled in the distance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The twinkling star exploded in a dazzling manner and scattered throughout the universe. How big must the star have been that the explosion could be seen from here?</p>
<p class="orv_line">But since it was so far away, that star must have exploded a long time ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was already seeing the end of a star that no longer existed in the world. With that thought in mind, he vaguely reached out to the sky, and saw a few meteors flying from the direction where the star had exploded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One of the meteors was flying straight towards Cheon Inho.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho was startled and took a step back. With a light noise, the meteor crashed not far from the snowfield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho hurriedly approached the place where the meteor had fallen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a small cradle there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho knelt down and put his hand into the cradle.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「There was a newborn baby who seemed to have been born in a story.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho slowly picked up the baby. Then the baby looked at him. He only received a glance, but at that moment, Cheon Inho felt his blurry self become clearer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did Cheon Inho realize who this baby was, and what he could give him.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Thus, the 'One Who Deceived the Stars' finally reached the reward of the scenarios.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho smiled and called the baby’s name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Your name is Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The baby smiled brightly.</p>
