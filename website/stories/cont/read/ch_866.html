            <div class="orv_title"><h1>866 Episode 47 King of Fear (10)</h1></div>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Kuaaaaat—!】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Along with Asmodeus's scream, a deafening roar echoed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I crouched down, grabbing the wrist of the guy who was trying to run away.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Let go of this! Damn it!】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus tried to shake me off and run away, but he realized it was too late and began to unfold his own story. The story he built up while living as the 'Recorder of Fear' and 'Outer God'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story, 'False Demon's Banquet', begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Surprisingly, it was a story I had read in 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 False Demon's Banquet. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The characteristics of this story, where the number of uses resets every time the full moon rises, were as follows.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Change all attacks that pour down on you for 1 minute into banquet fireworks. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Originally, it was a technique used by the Highest-Ranking Demon King 'Ruler of Eastern Hell' Agares in some rounds, but for some reason, it seemed that Asmodeus had inherited the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fierce blue that surged from the air was transformed into a splendid banquet fireworks. A vivid baptism of fireworks that dyed the white night of the Snowfield red and blue.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Kim Dokja.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus was glaring at me from the center of the fireworks.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Why did you call me in this situation?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I laughed, still not letting go of the guy's wrist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You were the one who asked me to call you when I meet the King of Fear."</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I met Asmodeus in the Recorder's Room a while ago, I had made a promise with Asmodeus in exchange for getting my brother back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'If I meet the King of Fear, I will call him.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">I simply kept that promise.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【It’s not just the King of Fear here!】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus looked around with bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">On one side was Kim Dokja of the Snowfield, who was spreading a cold air, and on the other side was the King of Fear, who was emitting an unreadable aura.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story, 'False Demon’s Banquet', stammers its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Sparks flew in the air, and the story’s power began to weaken.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was natural. Those two Kim Dokjas were among the strongest Transcendent beings I’ve ever encountered. At least in this 'Snowfield', even the Myth-grade Constellations wouldn’t be able to stop them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn’t even guess how much probability it would take to replace the attacks they were pouring out with firecrackers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Please stop the fight. Can’t you?"</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Why should I do that?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"If you don’t stop that, your plan will go awry."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don’t know, but Asmodeus must have been thinking of confronting the King of Fear directly and taking his power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, even for Asmodeus, it was impossible to deal with both of them at once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus must have noticed my intentions and let out a bitter smile.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【You’ve made quite a gamble, Kim Dokja.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus looked back and forth between the King of Fear and Snowfield Kim Dokja and said.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【It’s true that if the two 'big fragments' here merge, my position will be a bit awkward.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Will you stop them?"</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Even I can’t deal with them for long in this space.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The range of the firecrackers was shrinking in real time. Even for Asmodeus, it seemed too much to delay this situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Can’t you borrow the power of the kkoma Kim Dokjas in the theater?"</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Do you think it’s that easy to make the kkoma Kim Dokjas imagine the same thing?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Judging by the probability flowing through his body, it seems that the kkoma Kim Dokjas’ power was already being used right away.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【If you hand over your [Fourth wall] to me, that would be another matter.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">We smiled at each other. Both of us already knew that it was an impossible deal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, Asmodeus took a step back first.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【I can make it in a little while.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"How much in a little while?"</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Five minutes, more than that is impossible. So—】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With the sound of probability, the power of the story shattered. The firecrackers disappeared and the stories from both sides surged toward us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus kicked my chest with his foot and said.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【With that smart head, find a way quickly!】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I fell to the ground and was buried in the Snowfield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Almost at the same time, a pitch-black shadow appeared in the air.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Okay, everyone. It's intermission time.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The entire sky turned pitch black like a movie theater screen with the lights off, and soon a huge hexagonal black substance appeared.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Silver Screen Seal' begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus, Snowfield Kim Dokja, and the King of Fear were nowhere to be seen. It seemed like all three were inside that hexagonal object.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a story that reminded me of 'The Seal of the Apocalypse'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is that technique a desperate move that can buy me 5 minutes?</p>
<p class="orv_line">While the Outer Gods crawling on the floor howled like cats that had lost their owners, I desperately racked my brain to find a way to make the most of the time Asmodeus had given me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is the 'Snowfield'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All the resources I have can be put to the best use here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But in a situation where [Incite] doesn't work, what on earth can I do to stop them? I thought about borrowing the power of First Kim Dokja, the 'Demon King of Salvation', but there was no response, perhaps because there was a problem with the communication of the [Fourth Wall] since a while ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, it must mean that it is time to reveal the cards I have been saving up one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I let out a light sigh and started to receive the 'Fear Rewards' that I had been putting off.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Would you like to use the item 'Story Fragment Selection Ticket'?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Use it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Story Fragment Selection Ticket.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was the reward I received when I successfully interpreted the fear of 'Subway Home' when I entered the Transcendent Alliance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unfortunately, it was a flaw that it was called 'Story Fragment' instead of 'Story', but I was grateful for this now.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Prints a list of available story fragments.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>1. The Relationship Between Hands and Feet</p>
<p>2. The Friend of a Small Stone</p>
<p>3. The Bone That the Demon King Threw Away After Eating</p>
<p>4. A Piece of Starlight in the Water</p>
<p>5. A Dumpling That Someone Left Behind</p>
<p>…</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">However, I could not find any useful story fragments. It was the same no matter how many pages I turned. Most of the story fragments I could see were trashy story fragments.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, I did not give up hope.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How many compensation pages did I turn? Finally, a story fragment that seemed useful appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will choose story fragment number 214."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Acquired story fragment 'Graffiti on the Wall'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Graffiti on the wall. It was a story that seemed like nothing special just by hearing the name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But according to my thoughts, this story was related to 'that person'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Story fragment 'Graffiti on the wall' begins its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As if a warm match was lit on the Snowfield, the story began.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I'll be really sad if I tell everything and no one understands. Everyone has a wall and communication is impossible... It's obvious." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Still, we have to talk about anything. After all, there is someone on the other side of that wall."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Outer Gods who were wandering around gathered nearby one by one to watch the story.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "There's a wall, so what can you talk about?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"You can just write on the wall."」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I also stood in the gap between them and watched the old story. Even though it wasn't the story I lived, I somehow felt nostalgic. Maybe it's because I, too, used a part of my life to write this story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, like the conversation with Kim Dokja that day, this story remained as a story, and it is being read by someone now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know you're there."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I said this, I felt a small presence behind me. Then, a being appeared, tearing the space apart like a curtain. He was a warrior who protected the 'King of Fear'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A fiercely rippling shadow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I met the sadly shining eyes above the shadow's face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The King of Transcendents."</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was his nickname.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was the most perfect incarnation in this world. A person born into the world through Kim Dokja's comment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Jang Hayoung."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The shadow's appearance changed with my words. As if she were only revealing her veil to those who could recognize her, her hair changed to a swaying golden color.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, it was not a situation to be amazed. Because she immediately spoke in a sharp voice.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[How do you have that story?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Because I'm also Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't think it was a coincidence that this story fragment came to me. As Snowfield Kim Dokja said, all Kim Dokja fragments have the property of attracting each other. So perhaps this story fragment came to me too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Would you like to see more?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…Yes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">We listened to the story of the story fragment in silence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story contained in the fragment was short.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "The other person won’t know what’s happening on the other side of the wall anyway?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At most, it was a few words of conversation between Kim Dokja and Jang Hayoung.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "At least that wall has changed. Then, maybe someone will read it someday." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The scenery of the restaurant and the air of that day, which lingered like the sound of a broken music box. Like a lit match going out, the memories quickly dispersed into smoke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung urged.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[One more time.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I activated the story fragment once more. The story spoke and we listened. After a while, the story went out again.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[One more time.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"No."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Why?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"We don’t have much time. Instead, if you grant me a favor, I will show you the story again as many times as you want."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung looked at the story fragment with regretful eyes and asked.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What is your request?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't you already know?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung hesitated for a moment and shook her head.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[No.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I knew you would say that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, I asked in a shameless voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We must stop that fight. Isn't it your duty to protect the King of Fear?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung, the King of Transcendents.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If she had seen the end of the scenarios with &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; in the 1,864th round, she would definitely be able to mediate that fight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Even if that were my duty, I can't grant your request.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Why?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I can't interfere with the 'Kim Dokjas’' affairs.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed that she had some special restrictions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well. Unlike other members &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt;, the reason she was able to descend directly into the 'Fear Realm' was because she had placed such restrictions on herself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That fight could kill the King of Fear."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I know. But that's not 'real death' in the strict sense.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung seemed to have a vague idea about our situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A war to choose a single Kim Dokja. When Kim Dokja and Kim Dokja fight, the true side is absorbed into the other Kim Dokja. If we don’t recognize each fragment as a single entity, then this fight will only be seen as a journey to become a complete Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swallowed a light sigh and opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Okay. Then can I ask you something else?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What is it?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"The [Unidentified Wall] you have. Can you still use it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung tilted her head for a moment and said.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Well… I can still use some of its functions. But why?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If I remember correctly, the [Unidentified Wall] had several functions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then it would be possible to contact the Constellations."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Through the [Unidentified Wall], Jang Hayoung was able to communicate one-on-one with 'almost all beings' in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;. In fact, in the main story, Jang Hayoung used this ability to trade with various Constellations. I asked, looking at the rewards of the Fear Realm that I had not yet received.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Can I contact people from other worldlines through that 'wall'?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[That's not possible.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, even if it's the [Unidentified Wall], that would be difficult. I thought that if I could contact &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt;, or if I could contact a Transcendent being like the 'Secretive Plotter', that would be great.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then this is only possible for this worldline."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of the Constellations that could stop that confrontation in our worldline.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But no one came to mind easily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I really dealt with Zeus or Odin, then it would be different, but if I dealt with those guys, I would definitely lose all my stories and live as a slave to the giant nebula for hundreds of years.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought of other Constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Like Uriel, Breaking the Sky Sword sAINT, or the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon... Sure, they were all attractive choices, but strangely enough, I wasn't sure if they could stop the fight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While narrowing down my choices one by one, someone's name suddenly came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wait, could that person work too?</p>
