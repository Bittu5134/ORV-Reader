            <div class="orv_title"><h1>830 Episode 42 Destination (6)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Since that day, my nickname has become &#39;End&#39;. It makes sense, because the next day, a countdown started to appear above my head.</p>
[Time remaining: 28 days 3 hours]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This is the same no matter how you look at it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">28 days 3 hours later, this &#39;End of Terror Zone&#39; will be destroyed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey, that kid said he ended the end of the end of terror?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">And I&#39;m the crazy guy who pressed that destruction button.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is it true that you unlocked the end-level horror?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow, I really have to live long enough to see this. That paper was all read?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I feel wronged, too. What did I know? I just like reading.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I read it because I&#39;m a reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So that paper can&#39;t be used anymore?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What did you get in return? If you had interpreted it, you would have gotten a reward.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reward. Of course I got a reward.</p>
[Acquired the Story Fragment &#39;Murim Dumpling Recipe&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, I wondered if this was the reward for interpreting the &#39;Final Tale&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then on the other hand, I thought it might be a valuable Story Fragment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As far as I know, this recipe is now out of print.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#39;ll give it to Yoo Jonghyuk later when I meet him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kim End-nim.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned around to see who came to pick a fight again, Anna Croft was standing in front of me with two cups of coffee. It was a refreshing sight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, Kim Anna-nim.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You look free.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now, openly picking a fight, Kim Anna handed me the coffee.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The coffee I drink in the horror room tastes much more bitter than the coffee I knew.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course it is.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is &#39;horror coffee&#39;. It&#39;s black water with a strange setting that temporarily increases your immunity to fear when you drink it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, I&#39;m so free, my head&#39;s going to explode. Is the work worthwhile?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s been three days since I entered the terror zone. In those three days, Kim Anna, who entered the first unit, has already been deployed to five &#39;time faults&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. It was better than I thought.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although she is still a newbie and has never been deployed to a time fault alone, Anna Croft&#39;s recent activities have been a hot topic within this lonely &#39;end zone&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In particular, because her [Future Vision] worked accurately in some time faults, the reputation of the &#39;Prophet&#39; among the Transcendents is once again on the rise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You look happy. As if you got a job at the company you wanted.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re mistaken.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anna Croft added, her face hardening in a hurry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But Cheon Inho. You haven&#39;t been assigned to any missions yet.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, I&#39;m just so great.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before I was even assigned to the time rift, I unlocked one &#39;End-level Terror&#39;, so the Transcendents couldn&#39;t possibly be happy about me. If they were to assign it wrong and unlock another &#39;End-level Terror&#39;, it would be a big deal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So the fact that I&#39;m stuck in the restaurant right now is a kind of disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is what a new employee who got into trouble right after joining the company does.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#39;ll say it again, I&#39;m also wronged.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Who wanted to do that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the company I wanted to work for wasn&#39;t the &lt;Transcendent Alliance&gt;, but &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Our captain asks a lot about you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it&#39;s the captain of the first division, it&#39;s Kyrgios Roadgraim.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So you told him that I&#39;m the worst villain you know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a joke to make people laugh, but Anna&#39;s answer was unexpectedly serious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re the one who keeps destroying the common sense of &#39;future&#39; that I was certain of. I said that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I just touched the poor coffee cup, wondering what to say. Anna Croft really seemed to care about me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So come to your senses. You don&#39;t plan on letting the &#39;Apocalypse Zone&#39; be destroyed like this, do you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t plan on that either. The problem is that there is a lack of hints on what to do to prevent the end.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">After joining the &#39;Transcendent Alliance&#39;, I lost contact with the first Kim Dokja, so I couldn&#39;t ask him anything over the phone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well... It&#39;s not like there were no clues to interpret it at all.</p>
「When that day comes, the boundary of sleep will open, and the King of Terror will descend.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If my guess is correct, the &#39;King of Terror&#39; mentioned in the prophecy of the end refers to &#39;the second Kim Dokja.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">How do I know?</p>
「In the snowy field of incomprehensible dreams, the King of Terror will smile, neither light nor darkness.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;A smile that is neither light nor darkness.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyone can see that it is an expression meaning &#39;the Watcher of Light and Darkness&#39;, a modifier of the second Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My question starts here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then why does the &#39;second Kim Dokja&#39; appear in the prophecy as the &#39;King of Terror&#39;. And why does the prophecy refer to his appearance as the &#39;prophecy of the end&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Everything was full of questions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Would the world turn upside down just by the appearance of the second Kim Dokja?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Isn&#39;t that a little strange?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked back indifferently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What&#39;s strange?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If that prophecy is true, this &#39;end zone&#39; will be destroyed in exactly 28 days.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s what&#39;s strange.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So what is it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The countdown to the end has begun, but look at those people.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at where Kim Anna had pointed. The cheerful-looking Transcendents were standing in line, filling their plates with dumplings. In a way, it was quite a sight. The losers of a world that even those constellations couldn&#39;t touch were standing in line to receive their dumplings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even Cheok Jungyeong was shouting in a brazen voice, &quot;Master! One of these dumplings is smaller than the others!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The dumplings must be delicious.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheon Inho. Do they look like people who are about to end?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Those people are Transcendents.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Even if it&#39;s a Transcendent, it&#39;s an &#39;end-level fear&#39;. I asked the captain, but he said that the &#39;end-level fears&#39; that have appeared so far have never been properly resolved.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hasn&#39;t it ever been resolved?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He said that the end-level fears can only be accepted. That&#39;s why it&#39;s the &#39;end&#39;, and a fear that no one can avoid.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If it was Kyrgios, who had grown so tall, and not another Kyrgios, who said that, then it must be true.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then why are those people so cheerful?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The clever Kim Anna looked at me with pitiful eyes at my question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think that&#39;s something you should figure out.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why? Please help me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s something that I can&#39;t see even with my [Future Vision]. However...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, our Kim Anna seemed to have caught on to something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Anna, who was watching the steam rising from the restaurant, slowly opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;When I look at them, I feel like they&#39;ve already experienced &#39;destruction&#39; once.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I listened to Anna&#39;s words and blankly stared at the backs of the Transcendents.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Among them were the Goryeo&#39;s First Sword Cheok Jungyeong, who was more aggressive than I remembered, and Kyrgios, who had grown much bigger than I remembered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In addition, I saw the commander of the Despair God, Cheongheo, who was watching them from afar, and the Young Byeondae and Il Byeondae vice-captains guarding him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at them for a moment and then said,</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s good advice.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They&#39;ve already experienced &#39;destruction&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">To Anna Croft, who was wide-eyed, I smiled like Kim Dokja and added,</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think I&#39;ve found a clue.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Deep inside the first floor of the industrial complex where the Transcendent Alliance resides, there is a &#39;Time Fault Room&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The very room that Cheok Jungyeong had first guided me to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Young Byeondae vice-captain, who happened to be guarding the room, greeted me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;New recruit. Are you here again?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There are no &#39;tasks&#39; to give to the new recruit today either.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s okay. I just came to look around.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Transcendent Alliance has &#39;tasks to solve&#39; every week.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, it goes like this.</p>
「Eliminate the disaster-level horror &#39;Backstepper&#39; that appeared in [2-16 round] (incomplete).」</p></div>
「Eliminate the disaster-level horror &#39;Dragon Eater&#39; that appeared in [22-14 round] (currently in progress).」</p></div>
「Eliminate the natural disaster-level horror &#39;Founder of the Absolute Throne&#39; that appeared in [124-24 round] (currently on hold).」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">According to the Transcendents, these tasks were a kind of earthquake that occurred in the &#39;time fault&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The otherworldly deities, foreign gods, or horrors that were wandering around the &lt;Star Stream&gt; would wander around looking for a place to hide and become parasites in the &#39;time fault&#39;, and from there, problems would occur throughout the fault.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Transcendents of the Transcendent Alliance were in charge of eliminating such strange phenomena and managing the &#39;time fault&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Kuoooooo!</p>
<p class="orv_line">On the screen, I could see Cheok Jungyeong cutting off the head of the &#39;Dragon Eater&#39;. It was a refreshing swordsmanship worthy of Goryeo&#39;s First Sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—He&#39;s a guy who drank a lot of dragon&#39;s blood, everyone, take out your alcohol. Today, I&#39;m going to make a special Yonghwa wine and drink it!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since I&#39;m a member of the Third Squadron, I should have gone on that hunt. However, after the &#39;End of the Fear&#39; incident, I was restricted from entering the time fault, and thanks to that, all I could do was look at other faults here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well, there&#39;s nothing I can do. Since the Transcendents say I can&#39;t, I can&#39;t force myself into the fault.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So what have I been doing these past few days?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you trying to watch the video again?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You won&#39;t get stronger from watching it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m just a little interested.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this time fault room, you couldn&#39;t only see the &#39;time fault&#39; currently in progress. In short, I could also view the cases of the &#39;time fault&#39; that had already been resolved.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, the one I chose was,</p>
「[42-16th round] The genius-level horror &#39;Darkness that descends&#39; (Complete)」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Darkness that descends. It was an Outer God&#39;s name that I didn&#39;t know well. However, I knew very well who had defeated it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Baekcheong&#39;s swordsmanship that was dazzlingly displayed on the screen. Indeed, it was a skill that gave me goosebumps whenever I saw it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh? Rookie! Are you watching our captain&#39;s video?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned around at the noise, I saw familiar faces standing there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first platoon leader and the commander-in-chief—&#39;Despair God Cheongheo&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. I was watching it because it was on the viewing list.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first platoon leader asked with a bright face at my answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Isn&#39;t our captain incredibly strong?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He is incredibly strong.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The captain still talks about you a lot these days. How on earth did you possess our captain?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked up at the face of the chattering boy. Although he looked like a boy on the outside, it was clear that the first lieutenant was also a transcendent who had lived for a very long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy&#39;s name was Ryunard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was called the &#39;Naked Saint&#39; because he always fought naked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You shouldn&#39;t trouble a newbie, Ryunard.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The one who intervened was the one guarding the room.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The captain of the Young Brigade who was there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ryunard muttered with a frown.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Carlton-nim is only picky about me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No. According to Article 1, Section 8 of the Transcendent Alliance Residence Law...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">His name, Carlton Xavier, who was reciting laws one after another, was called &#39;Silver Binding&#39; because of the unique silver aura that shone from his entire body whenever he fought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re reading a good story.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The old man spoke to me instead of the two who were chatting away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The commander of the Transcendent Alliance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheongheo, the god of despair.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The old man who was known to be stronger than anyone else in this &#39;Transcendent Alliance&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first, I didn&#39;t know, but now I&#39;m starting to realize it. Just standing next to him makes me feel sick.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This old man is definitely strong. He&#39;s strong enough to compete with even the mythical-grade constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kyrgios is a great captain. If you refer to his videos, you&#39;ll definitely learn a lot.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Actually, it&#39;s a little strange. The Captain Kyrgios I knew wasn&#39;t that big.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, there&#39;s a story behind that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What&#39;s the story?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheongheo stared at me in response to my question. It was as if my inner thoughts were written in his eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I can tell you, but is that really why you came here?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He really isn&#39;t an ordinary old man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shook my head with a bitter smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No. I have something to ask the Commander-in-Chief.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I knew it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheongheo was silent for a moment. I also remained silent for a moment and followed Cheongheo&#39;s gaze. We looked up at the time-fault that had piled up for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is the world inside that fault perhaps a different &#39;worldline&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It may have been so at one time, but it&#39;s not anymore. Now, it&#39;s literally a &#39;fault.&#39; It&#39;s a cross-section of events that have already passed.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheongheo added, as if he knew what I was worried about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That means that even if we change something inside, actual history won&#39;t change. Well, there are special fault lines sometimes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s like a novel that&#39;s already finished.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Similar.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">What did the second Kim Dokja want to find in this world of countless completions?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe he wasn&#39;t looking for something, but just couldn&#39;t accept that this world was finished.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So maybe he was holding on to events that had already ended and continuing to cause earthquakes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I also know a novel that&#39;s already finished.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With that thought in mind, I slowly opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The novel begins with a giant tower appearing in the sky. People climb the tower to survive. They don&#39;t even realize that they&#39;re being redistributed as commodities while climbing the tower.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I started talking, the surroundings became quiet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued speaking in a quiet voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The protagonist of that novel is a man who has been stabbing for a very long time. He&#39;s a man who has stabbed more than anyone else in the world and has become stabbing itself.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Does silence have color? The moment the word 「stabbing」 came out, I felt as if the silence of the three people had changed to the same color at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When that color had spread enough, Ryunard asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Newbie, do you know who we are?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As he said, in fact, I already knew who Ryunard was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The same was true of Carlton standing there and Cheongheo who was looking at me right in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, the reason I didn’t recognize them from the beginning was probably because I was afraid of something. But now I had to accept it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You guys are.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">These were the characters in 「The World After The Fall」 written by Kiyeon and me—</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;People from a world that has already been destroyed.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before coming here, they were the colleagues of &#39;Master Jaehwan&#39; whom I had met.</p>
