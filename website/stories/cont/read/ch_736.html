            <div class="orv_title"><h1>736 Episode 29 Recorder of fear (3)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">From the next day, the party participated in the scenario again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As expected, wearing a mask makes me feel at ease.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansu ahjussi also nodded at Kyung Sein’s words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It feels like I was naked and then put on clothes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I may be wondering how they could feel that way when they only wore a mask, but after actually wearing a mask, the attitudes of my companions changed significantly.</p>
[The character &#39;Kyung Sein&#39; regains confidence.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I also felt fortunate that I was wearing a mask. Because I wasn&#39;t confident in hiding my expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">5I slowly turned my head and looked at Dansu ahjussi.</p>
[Character information regarding the character &#39;Lee Dansu&#39; is being updated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A cold sensation clung to my spine. I once received a message in Gwanghwamun that Ye Hyunwoo had become a &#39;character&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, following Kyung Sein, now there is even Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What are the standards for &#39;alternative </p>
<p class="orv_line">characterization&#39;? What is the difference between a &#39;character&#39; and a person who is not a &#39;character&#39;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cha Yerin said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hide in a small story to avoid being eaten by a huge story.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There are stories that can only be seen objectively if they are hidden.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A bit late, I realized that it was a story about &#39;masks&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see prisoners bustling around outside the window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was easy to read the facial expressions of all the maskless beastmen. Happy, sad, angry or tired faces.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now that they have become part of the Recycling Center, they can only make facial expressions enforced by &#39;Zone 13&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein muttered as if she was impressed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They said everything in the &lt;Star Stream&gt; is a story.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This &#39;mask&#39; is the minimum narrative that can protect us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Recycling Center was informing us now. In order not to be swept away by the big story, you have to keep your own story straight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just like Kim Dokja once did.</p>
[You understand the essence of the &#39;Recycling Center&#39;.]</p></div>
[Main scenario updated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The main scenario was updated as if it had been waiting for it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately checked the message.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Main Scenario #8 – Zone 13&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Main</p>
<p>Difficulty: S+</p>
<p>Clear conditions: Unite the beastmen of Zone 13 and challenge the throne of the &lt;Zodiac&gt;.</p>
<p>Time limit: 60 days</p>
<p>Reward: Obtain a ticket to attend the Chinese Zodiac Banquet, choose between 300,000 coins or 50,000 recycled coins and obtain  the story fragment &#39;Understanding of the Unemployed&#39;.</p>
<p>Failure: —</p>
<p>* There are &#39;additional clear conditions&#39; in this scenario.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein, who had confirmed the reward, opened her mouth with joy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Zodiac Banquet? Isn’t this something like the &#39;Constellation Banquet&#39;? I really enjoyed the &#39;Constellation Banquet&#39; episode.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Can we see Uriel and Jecheon Castle?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is in the name of the zodiac, so I think only people from the zodiac will come.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Chinese zodiac banquet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the very event that &#39;The Tiger Who Eats Rice Cake&#39; once mentioned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t know that it was an event that occurred at the &#39;Recycling Center&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you think about it, this round&#39;s &lt;Zodiac&gt; was a bit unusual. Originally, the constellation of the &lt;Zodiac&gt; was not a group with proper solidarity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, in this round, it even has a scenario through a stage called &#39;Recycling Center&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a situation where I don&#39;t know what kind of &lt;Zodiac&gt; I will face in the future, the reward for conquering this scenario was quite fascinating.</p>
「&#39;Understanding the Unemployed&#39; is a story fragment that must be acquired in order to confront the &lt;Zodiac&gt;.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A story fragment that is mentioned in Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s recollection in &#39;Ways of Survival&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I must clear this scenario at all costs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is the clear conditions.</p>
[Check additional clear conditions.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">—You must secure the support of prisoners to challenge the &#39;unification of Zone 13&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—When more than 80% of the population supports you, you will be elected as the &#39;representative&#39; of Zone 13.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—When elected as a district representative, you can form a committee responsible for Zone 13.</p>
[Currently, 9% of prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&quot;Have you all checked the additional clear conditions?&quot;</p>
<p>In response to Ye Hyunwoo’s question, the group members nodded one by one.</p>
<p>&quot;Should we each tell our approval ratings? It says 3 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I’m… zero percent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It’s one percent.&quot;</p>
<p>As Kyung Seun and Dansu ahjussi spoke, Cha Yerin also opened her mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;Two percent.&quot;</p>
<p>The last answer was Killer King, who was smiling meaningfully.</p>
<p>&quot;5%. Kim Dokja, what percentage do you have?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nine percent.&quot;</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo nodded his head.</p>
<p>&quot;The representative will be Dokja-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After 「The Three Little Pigs」, the inn’s crane owner changed his attitude towards us. Not only did he not charge us for meals, he even changed our accommodations.</p>
<p>&quot;I don’t have anything in particular to wish for.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#39;s what he said, but the crane owner seemed like he wanted to tell us something every time he saw us.</p>
<p>&quot;If there’s anything you want to ask for, please let me know anytime.&quot;</p>
<p>The crane owner said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you are very brave. Just don’t be too disappointed if not everyone is as brave as you.&quot;</p>
<p>At his unexpected honesty, I hesitated for a moment and then added.</p>
<p>&quot;It’s okay. That’s…&quot;</p>
<p>“It was truly an amazing sight when you slaughtered the pig. I’m sure some beastmen were impressed by your performance. There were also others whose hearts were boiling. But.&quot;</p>
<p>After a short pause, the owner continued his words.</p>
<p>&quot;Not everyone can do that. The beastmen here will be more afraid of you when they see you.&quot;</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t understand it at first, but when I thought about it carefully, it made sense.</p>
<p>&quot;Are they afraid of change?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It’s similar.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But they can’t live like this forever, right? Even with &#39;The Three Little Pigs&#39;—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The prisoners stayed here too long.&quot;</p>
<p>They stayed too long.</p>
<p>It was a bit of a feeling of déjà vu.</p>
<p>Was it the demon world? Or was it paradise?</p>
<p>I think Kim Dokja also heard something similar somewhere.</p>
<p>&quot;Not everyone wants to have their own &#39;mask&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p>The owner&#39;s voice conveys a strange sense of fatigue. A thought suddenly occurred to me.</p>
<p>Maybe the beastmen here are not afraid of the Zodiac.</p>
<p>Having a mask means building your own story.</p>
<p>They are now afraid of taking responsibility for their own stories.</p>
<p>After quickly devouring the omelet rice made by the chef, I went out to the vacant lot and checked the stories I had accumulated so far one by one.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[A new story is germinating within you.]</p>
<p>Excluding the &#39;Persistent Murim Master&#39; obtained from Dragon Head Ark, there were a total of four stories that I accumulated on my own.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「Recorder of things that will disappear obtained at Seoul Station.」</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「Heir to the Eternal Name obtained after defeating the Deity of the Other World together with Han Sooyoung.」</p>
<p>And 「The One Who Rewrites Fate」 obtained by dealing with the giant nebulae with the Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<p>Lastly, the new story I will get this time.</p>
<p>Since the sponsor contract has already been completed, completing five stories won&#39;t suddenly make me a constellation, but I felt that I had built up stories quite steadily, even compared to Kim Dokja in the main story.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[A new story awaits your new achievements.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Additional achievements are required to fully blossom the story.]</p>
<p>It was a message I had never heard before, but it wasn&#39;t a bad situation.</p>
<p>Rather good.</p>
<p>The longer it takes for blossoming to occur, the higher the level of the story I obtain. If high-level stories are successfully developed, the name of &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; will become even more widespread.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[A few constellations in the nebula &lt;Zodiac&gt; are showing hostility towards you.]</p>
<p>As if they knew that fact, the constellations of the Chinese zodiac seemed to be keeping me in check.</p>
<p>However, there were no constellations directly interfering with Zone 13.</p>
<p>I know why they are hesitant to intervene.</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【Student.】</p>
<p>It&#39;s because of this wolf.</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【That’s not how you do it.】</p>
<p>A god from another world who defeated the pig constellations that activated 「Staging」.</p>
<p>Since yesterday, I have been learning [The Way of the Wind] from him.</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【I&#39;ll show you again.】</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Way of the Wind  was Kim Dokja’s main skill.]</p>
<p>Kim Dokja also had a hard time learning this skill.</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【I don&#39;t understand why you can&#39;t do this.】</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm, maybe it’s because I don’t have a charm?&quot;</p>
<p>Originally, [Way of the Wind ] was a skill that only incarnations with the &#39;Imyuntar Charm&#39; could learn.</p>
<p>However, I have no luck as I did not participate in the &#39;disaster scenario&#39;.</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【Since I am no longer the &#39;guide&#39; of the scenario, I can teach [Way of the Wind ] regardless of whether the charm exists or not.】</p>
<p>&quot;The use of skills is blocked in Zone 13. Maybe that’s why I can’t learn it—&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【That&#39;s why it&#39;s being taught in the form of story fragments. Skills are stereotypical surnames, and surnames are refined tales. In other words, if you know how to handle stories, you can use [Way of the Wind ] without activating the skill.】</p>
<p>&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes. I am a talentless  piece of trash.</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【I&#39;ll show you again, so follow along carefully.】</p>
<p>Lycaon blinked slowly and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【A gale in my left hand, a storm in my right hand. Where straight lines and curves collide, the path of the wind will open.】</p>
<p>The fierce wind split before my eyes, truly opening the [Way of the Wind].</p>
<p>Once again, I was amazed.</p>
<p>That&#39;s the original [Way of the Wind].</p>
<p>It feels different from what the Demon King of Salvation used.</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【Now, try following along. A gale in my left hand.】</p>
<p>I hesitantly followed Lycaon.</p>
<p>&quot;Gale in the left hand.&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【Crung! Bigger! A storm in my right hand.】</p>
<p>&quot;In my right hand... a storm!&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【Where straight lines and curves collide, the path of the wind will open! Shout out with some confidence!】</p>
<p>The only people who are okay with reciting lines like this are probably Kim Namwoon or Yoo Jonghyuk. The former is that kind of guy, and the latter is a cool guy no matter what he says.</p>
<p>As neither of the two, I had to mumble like a small octopus.</p>
<p>&quot;Where straight lines and curves collide, the path of the wind will open...&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Abyssal Black Flame Dragon&#39; likes &#39;Way of the Wind&#39;.]</p>
<p>Naturally, [Way of the Wind] was not opened.</p>
<p>Lycaon looked at me blankly and asked.</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【Why can’t you doit? I told you everything. again! A gale in your left hand!】</p>
<p>Finally, I couldn&#39;t bear it anymore and answered.</p>
<p>&quot;That’s just shouting out words like that.&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【No. It is important to understand this &#39;enlightenment&#39;.】</p>
<p>What kind of enlightenment is there?</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【You must understand the meaning contained in the story.】</p>
<p>No, I mean, in a gale and storm, what great meaning does it have?</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【Look at them.】</p>
<p>Lycaon pointed to the group of people who, like me, were practicing [Way of the Wind] in an open space about a dozen steps away.</p>
<p>The first person that caught my eye was Cha Yerin.</p>
<p>&quot;Left hand. Gale. Right hand. Storm.&quot;</p>
<p>The energy of the wind was rushing from both her hands as she freely chanted the spell.</p>
<p>Although it was not as grand as Lycaon&#39;s, it was definitely the [Way of the Wind].</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Incredible! Oh, she is a very outstanding incarnation. She truly understands the nature of the wind.]</p>
<p>For reference, it only took 30 minutes for Cha Yerin to learn [Way of the Wind].</p>
<p>I was curious about the secret and asked, and Cha Yerin answered as follows.</p>
<p>&quot;I just… just did it and it worked.&quot;</p>
<p>There are just geniuses in this world.</p>
<p>I gave up trying to figure out the secret and looked back at the other group members.</p>
<p>The man who had been repeatedly clenching and unclenching his fist in a corner from earlier said with a light sigh.</p>
<p>&quot;As I get older, it’s not easy to learn new things.&quot;</p>
<p>For your reference, Dansu ahjussi succeeded in learning [Way of the Wind] in five hours.</p>
<p>Kyung Sein, who was practicing [Way of the Wind] next to him, also added a word.</p>
<p>&quot;You have too much humility. You learned an hour faster than me…&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm, that’s what Kim Dokja said. In this world, age and gender don’t matter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, you remember that too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I actually have a good memory.&quot;</p>
<p>I doubt whether that person is really Dansu ahjussi who mistook Sneaking Schemer for Secretive Plotter.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyway, Hyunwoo is late.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He went out scouting to test the Way of the Wind, so why not come back around evening?&quot;</p>
<p>Ye Hyunwoo, who had mastered [Way of the Wind] early</p>
<p> on, was also flying around Zone 13.</p>
<p>For reference, it took 3 hours for Ye Hyunwoo to get his first wind.</p>
<p>Among the group, he had the second best score after Cha Yerin.</p>
<p>&quot;Kim Dokja, could it be that you still haven’t mastered [Way of the Wind]?&quot;</p>
<p>I grinned at Killer King, who was approaching me sloppily. I never thought the day would come when I would be happy to see that face.</p>
<p>&quot;Killer King-ssi, didn’t you learn it too?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What nonsense? I mastered it right away.&quot;</p>
<p>Killer King, with a confident expression on his face, spread his hands wide and shouted loudly.</p>
<p>&quot;A gale in my left hand! A storm in my right hand!&quot;</p>
<p>When I thought about it, there were people other than Kim Namwoon and Yoo Jonghyuk who could confidently shout that spell.</p>
<p>&quot;…The way of the wind will open!&quot;</p>
<p>I felt a slight wind moving along with the spell.</p>
<p>I asked while looking at Killer King.</p>
<p>&quot;Isn’t that just clapping your hands quickly?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The training stops at this point, I have learned everything about [Way of the Wind].&quot;</p>
<p>No matter how you looked at it, it was the back of a person who had given up and was running away. Lycaon, who was watching Killer King from afar, muttered in admiration.</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【It was successful.】</p>
<p>&quot;That was a success?&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【It&#39;s faint, but I can feel the texture of the wind. You really are a great hard worker. That&#39;s impressive. But No matter how I look at it, I don&#39;t think you understand the gist of &#39;Way of the  Wind&#39; at all...】</p>
<p>Suddenly, I became the only person who couldn&#39;t learn [Way of the Wind].</p>
<p>Still, I didn&#39;t feel too bad.</p>
<p>I saw the group of people lined up laughing and talking, and then I saw little Yoo Jonghyuk sleeping leisurely on the bench.</p>
<p>Behind them stood our little brick house. Although it wasn&#39;t as big of a house as Kim Dokja Company wanted to live in, it was still our first house.</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【Student.】</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【Even if you are reincarnated, you are still the same.】</p>
<p>Shortly after being summoned, Lycaon realized that I was the reincarnation of Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>It was natural.</p>
<p>Because he is a &#39;god from another world&#39;.</p>
<p>Lycaon must have quickly realized that the story I had was different from the &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; he remembered.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Lycaon did not change his attitude toward me. Even though he didn&#39;t have a &#39;favorite friend&#39; and couldn&#39;t recall any memories with him, he still treated me as the &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; he knew.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was not me, but his courtesy to the story left behind by the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;I’m sorry. I thought it would be easy this time since I learned it in my previous life, but I guess I’m not talented.&quot;</p>
<p>Lycaon looked at me with strange eyes.</p>
<p>An expression that seems sympathetic, lonely, or quietly observing.</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【Even in your previous life, student never learned any skills. Even though you’ve  used it before.】</p>
<p>&quot;Well... I did.&quot;</p>
<p>I also want to steal it, but damn, I don&#39;t have [bookmark].</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【Does student know why he can&#39;t learn [Way of the Wind]?】</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm.&quot;</p>
<p>I thought of a sentence about [Way of the Wind] in my head.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「&#39;When one wind meets another wind, it forms Taegeuk, and when one wind meets another wind, it forms yin and yang.&#39;」</p>
<p>It is explained in &#39;Ways of Survival&#39;, and [Way of the Wind] read again by Kim</p>
<p>Dokja.</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;Four winds meet to form a direction, and then four more winds are added to form the Myo of the Eight Trigrams. As a result, the wind exists everywhere and nowhere.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>I remembered every single sentence about it.</p>
<p>Maybe that&#39;s where the problem lies.</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【You are  a being that cannot understand [Way of the Wind]. To be more precise—】</p>
<p>Some understanding comes only when you let go of what you know.</p>
<p>But I can&#39;t do that.</p>
<p>&lt;#&gt;【It seems that [Way of the Wind] has already been &#39;recorded&#39; in you .】</p>
