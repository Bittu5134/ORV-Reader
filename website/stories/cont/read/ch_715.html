            <div class="orv_title"><h1>715 Episode 26 Star Ladder (11)</h1></div>
「&quot;Die! Kill him somehow!&quot;」</p></div>
「&quot;This guy has already been managed. We can defeat him here!&quot;」</p></div>
「&quot;Defeat him and get the story!&quot;」</p></div>
「&quot;You crazy guy. Die! I’m telling you to stop and die!&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Great-grade constellations were shouting urgently on the pale screen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Every time the sword’s trajectory moved, someone&#39;s head was taken away.</p>
「&quot;That’s not enough to kill me, you bastards.&quot;」</p></div>
「&quot;Kaaaaaaak!&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Great-grade constellations that receive a terrible blow and exit every time their</p>
<p class="orv_line">incarnation bodies fall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;, who had defeated another constellation, looked up at the sky covered in blood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if he were aware of someone&#39;s gaze looking at him.</p>
【I don’t think he’s tired of it either.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus took a sip of the diet cola next to him and let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When he  took his  eyes off the screen for a moment and looked around, he saw kkomas Kim Dokjas looking at the screen with absorbed expressions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The little Kim Dokjas had different clothes, heights, and facial expressions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When he first brought them in, they definitely looked the same, but as time went by, they changed a little.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A kid wearing a brimmed hat with &#39;SSS&#39; written on it. A kid wearing a uniform from a martial arts novel. A kid recording something while wearing horn-rimmed glasses...</p>
<p class="orv_line">The kids, all with different tastes and favorite stories, were concentrating on the same story at this very moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus muttered with a light bitter smile.</p>
【Like you.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">An explosion sounded from the screen again. The sound of someone falling. Screams and screams. Asmodeus was a little amazed as he watched the rain of meteors fall.</p>
【By the way, this is my first time seeing something like that done in the seventh scenario area. The nebulae have really gone crazy. I don’t know if the follow-up will be done properly.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps the nebulae also know. Even though only great-grade constellations were being replaced, that level was almost catastrophic.</p>
【Well, when did those idiots think before moving?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Giant Nebula&#39;, which will be the main theme of this event, will probably suffer a huge blow of at least ten percent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, the nebulae carried out this operation. Even while resisting the probability of that terrifying &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
「For the first Kim Dokja, the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;, is worth it.」</p></div>
【I remember the day I first met him.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even before becoming the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;, the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39; was a bold personification.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He dared to touch the &#39;Dark Keeper&#39;, a member of the Demon King&#39;s family, and even used shallow sashimi to avoid Asmodeus&#39;s curse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though Asmodeus saw the entire process, he turned a blind eye.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because it was very interesting that a mere incarnation who did not have a single story did such a thing.</p>
[The story &#39;The One Who Watched the Demon King of Salvation&#39; nods.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">For the first time in a while, Asmodeus recognized the story stirring inside him and shook his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Long-term relationships sometimes become tales. Even if it was a bad relationship.</p>
[Some constellations that share stories with you have noticed your presence.]</p></div>
[Some constellations are displeased with your presence.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus burst into laughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just in case, he did it anyway.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seems that the constellations of &#39;that world line&#39; who like Kim Dokja were still alive.</p>
【There’s plenty of cola and popcorn, so why don’t you come here too?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The stars did not answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They wouldn&#39;t dare intervene either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because all the constellations from other world lines, including Asmodeus himself, are bound by special restrictions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then someone pulled his sleeve. When he turned around, a kkoma Kim Dokja was there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A particularly small individual among kkomas Kim Dokja.</p>
【Is there a problem?. Kkoma Kim Dokja.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kkoma Kim Dokja looked up at him with wide eyes. Then he looked at the screen once, then at Asmodeus, and again.</p>
【Hmm?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus&#39;s brow twitched greatly.</p>
【Are you really asking me to help you now?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He nodded his head vigorously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus gave a somewhat stern look.</p>
【Kkoma Kim Dokja. Have you forgotten who I am? I am &#39;Representative Kim Dokja&#39;. They are their enemies.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kkoma Kim Dokja tilted his head as if he didn&#39;t understand Asmodeus&#39;s words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus did not reply any further. Nevertheless, those clear eyes were looking at Asmodeus.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What kind of being is Kim Dokja?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although he had gathered quite a few of his fragments, Asmodeus still could not understand Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kkoma Kim Dokja&#39;s fingertips touched the back of Asmodeus&#39;s hand. Asmodeus, startled by the sudden warmth, shook his hand away and muttered as if it were bothersome.</p>
【Sorry, I can&#39;t help him. Have you forgotten that the theater suffered a huge blow due to your hasty intervention?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even though he knew that the kkoma Kim Dokja would not understand what he was saying, Asmodeus continued his speech.</p>
【At that time, some of the theater&#39;s functions were damaged, so aren&#39;t you unable to properly &#39;recover the fragments&#39; now? Why did I support Wonheung, who ruined my theater—】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus, who had been talking up to that point, closed his mouth. This is because the kkoma Kim Dokja did not look like he understood anything at all.</p>
【Why  am I talking about it when you can&#39;t understand what I&#39;m saying?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was no justification or reason for that, but if Asmodeus wanted to, he could have saved the Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is that if that happens, the story becomes complicated.</p>
[The Seongyoon Alliance is watching your intervention.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A message that seems to have been waiting for him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Due to the previous intervention, the giant nebulae also noticed his presence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he were to intervene in that scenario here, Asmodeus would have to suffer a significant amount of loss.</p>
【Anyway, his story won&#39;t end easily even if I don&#39;t come forward.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kkoma Kim Dokja&#39;s small hand, which hesitated, grabbed Asmodeus&#39;s cold hand again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus, who was tired of even shaking it off, did not avoid the hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He just stared at the screen with bored eyes.</p>
【The end of this world will be much crueler than he thinks.】</p></div>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">How many incarnations had he cut down? He even forgot to count.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fallen incarnations were piled up one after another under the lightly bouncing white and blue lightning.</p>
[Some constellations cannot withstand the shock of probability and fall into sleep.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As the constellations that had taken a huge hit due to unreasonable intervention in lower-level scenarios exited one after another, the number of those attacking them gradually decreased.</p>
[Your incarnation body has reached its limit.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Every time he swung his sword, he could taste the fishy taste of blood in his mouth. He can&#39;t remember the last time he fought like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’ve thought about it a lot.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation swung his sword, swung it, and swung it again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;After all, it’s a shame to die here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the decrease in the number of great-grade constellations entering, they are also tired.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this rate, there won&#39;t be any great-grade left who can touch the youngest, at least for the time being.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I haven’t been able to fully tell my youngest who &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; is yet.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you talking about? Stop and die! Please!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He cut down another incarnation of the charging great-grade constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I also want to read &#39;Ways of Survival&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Every Kim Dokja loves stories. The same was true for the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;. More than any other Kim Dokja, he loved &#39;Ways of Survival&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, in his opinion, the youngest was the best when it came to persistence in telling stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja just likes the &#39;story&#39; itself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja reads even the stories that all other Kim Dokja ignore. After reading all those stories, Kim Dokja now wants to write a new story.</p>
[The tale &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39; continues its storytelling.]</p></div>
[The &#39;Dark Keeper&#39; communicates with your tale.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Could it be possible to use something like &#39;Ways of Survival&#39;?&quot;</p>
[Some great fate is wishing for your death!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This is already the second message of fate he has heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Once three messages are filled, the power of [fate] becomes more powerful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He’s sure the nebulae guys will fill that number.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">An arrow flew and struck close to the heart. Blood poured out from the mouth of the Demon King of Salvation, who had stumbled greatly. Nevertheless, the Demon King of Salvation did not fall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If this continues, even if you catch me, you will all be doomed.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Forcing [fate] on an incarnation and forcing [fate] on a narrative-grade constellation have different levels of probability.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the giant nebula did not correct the error of [fate].</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, in order to force this [fate], the giant nebula would have sacrificed a huge amount of probability ´.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Forcing [fate] does not end. At least the minimum probability of executing that [fate] must be secured.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though he was stumbling, the Demon King of Salvation kept walking forward. One of the incarnations that was rushing towards him collapsed again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It means that you are far from being enough. Even our youngest knows that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blood-stained Demon King of Salvation grinned. Incarnations were scattered everywhere he walked. Without collapsing, he cut down the great-grade constellations again and again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Damn you, you crazy person. You are crazy!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How could it be like that—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">No one could stop him from swinging his sword with arrows stuck all over his body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They knew that if they pushed a little further he would collapse, but no one dared deal him the final blow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How could such a monster—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a fight with a decided outcome.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The probability of a huge nebula supported them, and the greatest incarnations of great-grade flocked to them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although it was not the power of their true bodies, the incarnation bodies with increased synchronization were dropped, and dropped, and dropped again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39; did not fall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Gatekeeper of Thebes&#39; muttered as if he were lost.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why don’t you fall down?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He began to grow shy, afraid that he might not be able to kill him. As his head became stained with fear, the tales surrounding him began to come into view little by little.</p>
[The tale &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39; continues its storytelling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Why do the &#39;mythical constellations&#39; covet the &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did they want a piece of him so much, even though they called him a &#39;discarded god&#39;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Gatekeeper of Thebes&#39; foolishly thought that he would finally understand everything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Everyone—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He couldn&#39;t bear to say anything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though he knows he just needs to push a little harder, he’s not sure.</p>
「I don’t think I can possibly kill that constellation.」</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Gatekeeper of Thebes&#39; is persuaded by the story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This was the power of stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason why a great-grade constellation cannot defeat a mythical-grade constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The great constellations whose fighting spirit was broken began to hesitate and retreat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But not all constellations were convinced.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As expected, it seems like great-grade idiots weren’t enough.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A long spear flew from somewhere and pierced the back of the Demon King of Salvation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One knee of the staggering &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39; broke for the first time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is not intimidated by such a powerful tale. </p>
<p class="orv_line">Likewise, only stars with great stories could do this.</p>
[The aftereffects of probability begin to blow.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A tailwind of probability that creeps in despite the rules of the &#39;scale&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Clearly, this was proof that this scenario did not allow the existence of that &#39;constellation&#39;.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Warlord of Ferocity&#39; increases the synchronization rate with his incarnation!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Ares, the god of ferocity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As many as 12 constellations of &lt;Olympus&gt;-grade entered the war with their own incarnations.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Warlord of Ferocity’ announces the end.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The great-grade constellations that had been intimidated by Ares&#39;s orders rushed forward again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation grinned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Youngest, are you watching?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The lightning striking from the sky became even stronger. Perhaps the giant nebula is sacrificing enormous probability for this transfer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You have to see a lot to write well.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cutting down the constellations that rush at him with one knee bent.</p>
[White Blue Steel, which had not been supplied with sufficient magical power, blinked. The Demon King of Salvation actually took advantage of the imbalance in magical power to cut down the incarnations as if performing acrobatics.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Every time the &#39;Blade of Faith&#39; flashed intermittently, a great-grade&#39;s incarnation fell.</p>
[The influence of the story &#39;Demon King of Salvation&#39; is gradually decreasing.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The ground in the area was set on fire by the heat wave wrapped in Ares&#39;s spear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation changed the mimicry form of &#39;Broken Faith&#39; to &#39;Unbreakable Faith&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He held his sword on the floor and took a deep breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A sentence for him was written above the [fourth wall].</p>
「The Demon King of Salvation had people he wanted to see.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When he lowered his head, he saw a cigarette on the floor. A lit cigarette smoking white smoke.</p>
「He won’t be able to see them anymore.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Smelling the acrid scent, the Demon King of Salvation read the sentence written on the wall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A story narrating his death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, it was a sentence for Kim Dokja who wanted to read the story as well.</p>
「Kim Dokja decided to accept the story.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation did not know who was writing the sentences on the wall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s like when he can&#39;t confirm whether the person behind that curtain is Yoo Jonghyuk or not.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, some people write, some read, and some live.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Together, they will complete this story, forever unable to touch each other.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation picked up the fallen cigarette and took a drag. Then, exactly one sip of the story seeped deep into his soul.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation said while looking down at his cigarette.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Keep writing, Han Sooyoung.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Seeing Ares approaching, the Demon King of Salvation mustered his last strength and held on to &#39;Unbreakable Faith.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because I can still read more.&quot; </p>
<p class="orv_line">He was still curious about the end of this story.</p>
