<p class="orv_line">Half an hour later, I hunted down the &#39;Giant Centipede&#39; and organized the items I obtained.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I managed to grab these two items in a hurry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t have any use for them right now, so I put them up for sale on the exchange through</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The centipede&#39;s core is used as an ingredient for the panacea, so there was a chance that Chinese</p>
<p class="orv_line">incarnations like Pei Hu would buy them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, I completely forgot about the overseas side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There are translations of &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39; in foreign languages, so maybe there are some</p>
<p class="orv_line">transmigrated foreign readers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi, we&#39;re ready.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I turned around to find Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi waiting for me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Okay. Let&#39;s go.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We went straight to Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When we told him what we wanted to do, he had the expected reaction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You want to go to the Theater Dungeon now?&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo thought for a moment, then asked Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi to leave for a</p>
<p class="orv_line">moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When they stepped back, Ye Hyunwoo asked in a low voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Does this have anything to do with Yoo Joonghyuk?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected of the 7th Apostle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I simply nodded and replied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because the only place Yoo Joonghyuk can go right now is the &#39;Theater Dungeon&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hmm, I guess so too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo&#39;s gaze drifted upward toward the top of the station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Somewhere up there, Yoo Joonghyuk, who had entered the theater, was probably slashing at</p>
<p class="orv_line">monsters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I heard from Sein-ssi last time. The Yoo Joonghyuk of this world is the 41st turn, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Which 41st turn?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you ask me which one.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There were two 41st turns. One before Shin Yooseung became the Disaster of Floods, and one</p>
<p class="orv_line">after.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled bitterly to myself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was no ordinary reader, indeed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My expression must have been serious, because Ye Hyunwoo laughed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You can pretend like you don&#39;t know, and I won&#39;t bother using Lie Detection.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a little numb as I watched him smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What a clever reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Probably the former.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then it&#39;s the &#39;41st turn&#39; from Omniscient Reader. The one where he failed the scenario and</p>
<p class="orv_line">turned Shin Yooseung into the &#39;Disaster of Floods&#39;...... and you&#39;re still going to the &#39;Theater</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dungeon&#39;?&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I was at a loss for words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You saw him yourself, Inho-ssi. He destroyed all the green zones and tried to kill us.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was true. We were almost wiped out in the Emergency Defense Battle because of Yoo</p>
<p class="orv_line">Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However.......</p>
「&quot;If you&#39;re really Cheon Inho, you can do this alone.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If I think he did it because he believed in me that much, I wonder if I&#39;m putting too much hope</p>
<p class="orv_line">into it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you go to the Theater Dungeon now, you might end up fighting Yoo Joonghyuk.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know, but I&#39;m going anyway.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo sighed and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Will the three of you be alright? Would you like some reinforcements?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you going to help me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We can&#39;t afford to lose Inho-ssi in a place like this. And.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo added hesitantly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I saw Inho-ssi talking to Yoo Joonghyuk on the railroad tracks. I don&#39;t know what happened</p>
<p class="orv_line">between you two, but Inho-ssi seemed to be on the same page with Yoo Joonghyuk.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#39;ve never thought about it like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We&#39;re okay. I&#39;m sorry if it seems like I&#39;m leaving you to do the finishing touches, since the</p>
<p class="orv_line">scenario isn&#39;t even finished yet.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, I was planning on passing on the Theater Dungeon anyway. It&#39;s hard enough to organize the</p>
<p class="orv_line">rewards here, and...... I&#39;ve already received enough support.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, Ye Hyunwoo has gotten quite a few coins with his new techtree, &#39;Infinite Uroboros&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">or something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, he hasn&#39;t even picked a sponsor yet, so he won&#39;t have to worry about sponsorship for</p>
<p class="orv_line">a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I can&#39;t wait to see what he picks the next time we meet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;By the way, I was surprised that Inho-ssi used the &#39;Poison Bomb&#39;.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t understand Ye Hyunwoo&#39;s words for a moment, as his voice lacked the slightest hint of</p>
<p class="orv_line">hostility.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I thought the recipe for that bomb was still only known to the Misreading Association.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo&#39;s eyes were calm as he looked at me. I answered, pretending to be calm too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I picked one up the last time I was with Killer King against the Misreading Association.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo smirked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s not that I think Inho-ssi is from the Misreading Association, I just.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was a little nervous.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did Ye Hyunwoo see me use the &#39;Idea of Almost Anything&#39;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though the &#39;Idea of Almost Everything&#39; wasn&#39;t an item that appeared in Omniscient Reader,</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo&#39;s perceptive mind could have picked up on something in that moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you don&#39;t mind, can you get me an item from the fifth floor of the Theater Dungeon? I&#39;ll buy</p>
<p class="orv_line">it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Look at this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What item do you want?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fifth floor of the Theater Dungeon is the [rewards room] where the replica items are located.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After thinking for a moment, Ye Hyunwoo said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s the &#39;Divine Weapon (神機箭)&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Amazing. I know what it is.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The question is.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But I don&#39;t know if that item is there.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m sure it does. It was in a movie too. It wasn&#39;t in Omniscient Reader, but there&#39;s no way it isn&#39;t</p>
<p class="orv_line">there, it must be there.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Speaking seriously, Ye Hyunwoo glanced at the &#39;Idea of Almost Anything&#39; wrapped in my arm</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">and added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because that&#39;s what I need for the &#39;5th stage of the Invincible Castellan techtree&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">What a clever reader.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What were you talking about with the Apostle?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Nothing much. We decided that instead of going to the Theater Dungeon by ourselves, we&#39;d</p>
<p class="orv_line">take care of some items for him.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aha.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I briefly recounted the story to Dansoo ahjussi and Kyung Sein.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You did well, it can&#39;t hurt to have a good relationship with the 7th ranked.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I agree.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">My thoughts were the same.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, Ye Hyunwoo didn&#39;t seem like a bad guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Okay, so now.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I turned to my last colleague, who was staring blankly into space.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Heewon-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who was sitting on a bench, looked up with difficulty. For some reason, her</p>
<p class="orv_line">expression was strangely grim.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sudden apology caught me off guard. The reason quickly became apparent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If only I was a little stronger.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon scratched the subway floor with the tip of her ground rat knife. She must have</p>
<p class="orv_line">been doing it for some time, the bottom of the bench was all scratched.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s vandalism.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a joke, but it didn&#39;t work very well.</p>
[The character &#39;Jung Heewon&#39; feels guilty about you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Guilt. Perhaps she was blaming herself for not being able to save me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Heewon-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knelt down on one knee and grabbed Jung Heewon&#39;s hand holding the sword with both hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her hand was rough and firm from who knows how many times she had swung the sword by</p>
<p class="orv_line">now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I carefully took the sword from her hand and began to draw on the subway floor. Using Jung</p>
<p class="orv_line">Heewon&#39;s scratches as a guide, I drew a human face. I also drew a small speech bubble next to it.</p>
「ᅲ ᅲ」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When I finished, you couldn&#39;t tell if it was a person or a dumpling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon stared down at the graffiti and muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You said it was vandalism.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at her and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re not the one who should feel sorry right now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon did her best.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was me who fell short.</p>
「All &#39;⬜⬜&#39; tells me about is &#39;my danger&#39;.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Looking back on it now, it was a dizzying situation. What if there had been a more powerful</p>
<p class="orv_line">beast than the giant centipede?</p>
「Jung Heewon could have died.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Just thinking about it made my heart go cold. Maybe I was getting too carried away by the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#39;m not Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#39;ll never be as lucky as he is, or as loved by the stars.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I have to keep living on this story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We&#39;re colleagues.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;ll be strong enough to not need you to protect me. I won&#39;t hide behind you forever.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon&#39;s eyes shook as she looked at me.</p>
[The character &#39;Jung Heewon&#39; is sad because of you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Sad?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly added as I handed her back the ground rat knife.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But this means that I&#39;m going to hide behind Heewon-ssi for a little while longer until I get</p>
<p class="orv_line">stronger.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon opened her mouth a little.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;.......&quot;</p>
[The character &#39;Jung Heewon&#39; is delighted by your words.]</p></div>
[Your understanding of the character &#39;Jung Heewon&#39; has increased.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I understood Jung Heewon&#39;s situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps this is how she can endure this crazy world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So, this is why I need your help again, Heewon-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Where else are you going?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked as she wiped her ground rat knife clean with a piece of cloth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She had just killed a giant centipede with that worn-out sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter where she is, Jung Heewon is Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, she had switched to a new weapon around this time in the &#39;Omniscient</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reader&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m going to the theater upstairs.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Theater? At this time?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You should change your weapon sooner or later. There are some good items upstairs, so why</p>
<p class="orv_line">don&#39;t you come with me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein interjected and quickly changed the subject.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, that&#39;s why you&#39;re going? But I&#39;m fine with my sword.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, that girl, Lee Jihye, was carrying a decent one too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As we headed upstairs, a figure stopped us at the ticket gate.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t have to ask who it was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Lee Jihye.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye, leaning against the vending machine, glared at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh. What.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thanks for earlier.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Her eyes shook, as if she hadn&#39;t expected to hear that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I was just doing you a favor.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then she turned away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A child will be a child.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You saved the others, too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw it clearly, even in my desperation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye, who acted as if she wouldn&#39;t do anything to help, was saving people from dying in the</p>
<p class="orv_line">meantime.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Times change, world lines change, but the essence of a person doesn&#39;t change much.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You should come with us.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Where?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Where your master is.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Master...... Do you know where he is?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye&#39;s eyes were filled with agitation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yoo Joonghyuk didn&#39;t tell you anything?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye didn&#39;t answer, but bit her lip hard.</p>
「Yoo Joonghyuk went to the Theater Dungeon, but he left Lee Jihye behind?」</p></div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s a decision I don&#39;t understand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye&#39;s sponsor is the &#39;Admiral Yi Sunsin&#39;, and there are many places in the Theater Dungeon</p>
<p class="orv_line">where naval battles are staged, but Yoo Joonghyuk left Lee Jihye alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s not the 3rd turn, but the 41st turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even when Lee Jihye died,</p>
「&quot;In the future, sea battles will be a bit difficult.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk said that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Just...... He told me to stay here and make sure you don&#39;t die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t know. Maybe because he trusts me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s what she said, but there was no conviction in her voice. I don&#39;t know the exact situation,</p>
<p class="orv_line">but it was an opportunity for me.</p>
[The exclusive skill &#39;Incite Lv.6&#39; is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I&#39;ll do my best villainous impression for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So your mission is over at the end of the &#39;Emergency Defense Battle&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s true, but.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yoo Joonghyuk is so selfish, right? Treating you like a child, doesn&#39;t he?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye tapped her tiptoes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Shut up. You don&#39;t know anything.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Come with us.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why would I.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I have information on top-grade items. When I get it, I&#39;ll give it to you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#39;t you want a new weapon? You&#39;ve been using a sword too, but if you get a new one, maybe</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk will take you with him.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The mention of a sword made Lee Jihye pause for a moment.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s the sword that&#39;s weak, not you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye bit her lip.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re just going out for a while. We&#39;ll be back before Yoo Joonghyuk comes back.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The innocent girl nodded slightly.</p>
[The character &#39;Lee Jihye&#39; has a slight affinity for you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe collecting &lt;Kim Dokja&#39;s Company&gt; is easier than I thought?</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">After a while, we arrived at the entrance of the theater.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Where did unni learn to use the sword?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The kendo club at school.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow, I&#39;m self-taught. What do you learn in a kendo club?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How to win, but not kill.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye, who had joined our group on a whim, was chatting with Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon mostly responded bluntly. Lee Jihye liked that bluntness and stuck by her side,</p>
<p class="orv_line">unable to let go.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, the two of them had gotten along well in Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We&#39;re almost there, everyone, get ready.&quot;</p>
[You are approaching the outside region. Be careful not to leave the scenario area.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The entrance to the dungeon, the first floor, appeared. Kyung Sein muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I didn&#39;t expect to come here again.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a strange feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This &#39;theater&#39; was the same theater where the real-life &#39;Kim Dokja&#39;s Banquet&#39; was held.</p>
[You have found a &#39;hidden dungeon&#39;!]</p></div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">[This dungeon has already been discovered by someone. You can&#39;t get the first discovery</p>
<p class="orv_line">achievement.]</p>
[A new hidden scenario has arrived!]</p></div>
<br>
<div class="orv_window">

<br>
[You have entered &#39;Theater Dungeon&#39;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The scenario message sounded like it had been waiting for us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We went straight to the dungeon entrance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the next moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Stop.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi stopped the group. The cockroach must have told him something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There&#39;s someone else besides us.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, my ears perked up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#39;t just the first basement floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I made my way upstairs.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I could hear people&#39;s voices on the first above ground floor as well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein and Dansoo ahjussi looked at me at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only Kim Dokja, Yoo Joonghyuk, and some of the prophets entered this &#39;hidden dungeon&#39; in</p>
<p class="orv_line">Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since the world we&#39;ve been transmigrated to isn&#39;t &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39;s&#39;, but &#39;Ways of Survival&#39;s&#39;,</p>

<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi, are those people.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first glance, there were more than a dozen people hiding on the first floor of the basement</p>
<p class="orv_line">alone. Counting the above ground floor, the number might be over thirty or forty.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hardened my expression and said.</p>
