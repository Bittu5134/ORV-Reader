<p class="orv_line">Just before I collided with the surface, I felt like I was going to lose my mind, even though I had increased my physique with coins.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[1,800 coins have been invested into 'Physique'.]</p></div>

<p class="orv_line">My body was numb from head to toe from the impact, and my ears were deafening. I could feel my body temperature dropping rapidly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a message from the constellations that held my fading consciousness together.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' appreciates your survivability.]</p></div>

<p class="orv_line">As I held my breath and calmly scanned my surroundings, I saw Jung Heewon's glimmering figure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Completely unconscious, her body was sinking deeper into the water.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I paddled toward her with all my might, but I couldn't save her with my ligament-torn arm. There was only one option.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I bit her arm hard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I choked as the river rushed into my mouth. I thought my eyeballs were going to fall out. Still, I couldn't give up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Jung Heewon died here, this round would be over.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Slowly, the strength drained from my body. Even as my breathing faded, I didn't let go of her arm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wake up, please.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that a strong splash of water came from somewhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As my breath caught in my throat, I saw a large monster coming toward us from the distance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An ichthyosaur (魚龍).</p>
<p class="orv_line">7th grade monsters species, sea serpent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sharp teeth flashed before my eyes. Then, a pitch-dark silence filled my senses.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>rlaehrwk25: Missed it</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi. Inho-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt something slap my cheek, and slowly came back to consciousness. The first thing I saw when I opened my eyes was the blinding flash of a cell phone, and then Jung Heewon's face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-ssi?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ha...... Really."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon breathed a sigh of relief. As I staggered to my feet, the ground suddenly tilted and shook.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon grabbed my shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Be careful, or we'll sink"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The river raged in the darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Upon closer inspection, I realized we were sitting on the remains of a small plastic structure. I wondered if it was the remains of a sailboat used by the Han River rescue team.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The air was strangely humid. I turned on my phone's flash and saw a wall of crimson above, below, and to the left.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the back of my mind, I remembered what happened before I lost consciousness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We had been eaten by an ichthyousaur.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You seem happy to have survived. We're about to die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I threw up water and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The light from my cell phone cast the shadows of the two of us against the crimson stomach of the ichthyosaur.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Never mind."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon spoke without looking in my direction, as if she already knew what I was going to say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi, you're a bit of a weirdo."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm kind of like that."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You always say weird things."</p>
<p class="orv_line">First I said I loved her, then I said she's not even my colleague.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon must be confused.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I had a friend like Cheon Inho, I would have cut him off immediately.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm sorry, though. I didn't mean it. I thought he would let Heewon-ssi go if I told him so."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He's a psychopath, isn't he?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a moment before answering.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A friend?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Not a friend."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I guess he's someone you know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded lightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was silent for a moment, as if she was thinking about something, and then she spoke up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"By the way, it hurts. How hard did you bite me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A human tooth mark was clearly visible on her right forearm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Embarrassed, I replied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm glad you did it, though. I woke up because it really hurt."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you hurt anywhere else? The wound from the fight earlier—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's fine, it's a really shallow cut."</p>
<p class="orv_line">......A shallow cut? From that 'Yoo Joonghyuk'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Anyway, what should we do now? We're trapped."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I measured the size of the stomach surrounding us. Fortunately, it didn't seem to be the sea commander that swallowed Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's for the best. We're safer here than in the Han River."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What if we melt with its digestive juices?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We need to escape before that happens."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How? We're not Pinocchio."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Pinocchio?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't you know?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Isn't she talking about the wooden puppet whose nose grows longer every time he lies?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, Pinocchio got eaten by a whale and escaped."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered reading that fairy tale a long time ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon seemed to think that we were in a similar situation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Long-Nosed Liar" nods.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at the message blankly, then snapped out of it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let me gather my thoughts for a moment, I think we need to come up with a plan."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Okay. What should I do?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Well..... If you remember how Pinocchio escaped from the whale's stomach, tell me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you think that will help?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Just in case."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, Pinocchio didn't tell us how to escape from an ichthyosaur.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 That will be Omniscient Reader. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">While Jung Heewon was seriously pondering, I closed my eyes and recalled the sequence of how</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja escaped from here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But in order to use this method, I needed someone's help.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Bihyung.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Soon, I felt the 'dokkaebi communication' connect.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Hoo...... So this is how it turned out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung sounded dejected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I don't know why so many strange things are happening this season.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Have you considered my offer?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I sent you a message saying I'm signing the contract, didn't you get it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, a window popped up in front of me.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>----&lt;Stream Contract Agreement&gt;</p>
<p>1. Incarnation Cheon Inho (hereinafter referred to as gap) will sign a exclusive contract with the</p>
<p>dokkaebi Bihyung (hereinafter referred to as eul) untill all scenarios are completed or until his</p>
<p>death.</p>
<p>......</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">----It felt strange to see this contract again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—This is really special, I wasn't going to do it originally.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't hard to figure out when Bihyung made up his mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Probably, right after seeing the confrontation between Yoo Joonghyuk and me. Judging by the coins that came in earlier, I guess the constellations watched the confrontation with interest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly checked Bihyung's contract, checking off the oddities and crossing off the concessions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You're pretty good at this, huh?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Because all contracts are similar.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, the 'Stream Contract Agreement' looked a lot like the 'Management Contract Agreement'</p>
<p class="orv_line">I always sign.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I remembered my days as a rookie writer, when I was a victim of contract scams.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The ratio is 8:2. You'll have 8 and I'll have 2.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'That's great by me, but isn't it supposed to be 7:3?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I saw how you did back then, so I thought it was okay to give you more.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was probably worried about losing me to another dokkaebi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A wise move, but it puts the hilt of the sword in my hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Well, while you're at it, I have one more favor to ask.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—No more ratio adjustments. This is the best I can do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Enough with the ratios, give me the scenario.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Scenario?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'There's a hidden scenario here.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung was speechless for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—How do you even know that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Does it matter?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung sighed again, and muttered something to himself about the Bureau, probability and sanctions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Well, yeah. There's a guy who already received this one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone already received this scenario?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new hidden scenario has arrived!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I checked the scenario window.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Hidden Scenario - Serpent Slayer&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Hidden</p>
<p>Difficulty: B</p>
<p>Clear Conditions: Kill the ichthyosaur 'sea serpent' and escape from its stomach.</p>
<p>Time Limit: 5 days</p>
<p>Reward: 4,000 coins</p>
<p>Failure: Death</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">The reward isn't as good as Kim Dokja's Hidden Scenario, but it's less challenging.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This should be enough to get the injured me and Jung Heewon through.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—No more objections to the contract? Do you need anything else?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'You'll have to give me the right to use the Dokkaebi Bag.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Dokkaebi Bag'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, this was the biggest benefit from the 'stream contract'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung immediately pulled up the 'Dokkaebi Bag's screen in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Don't you have to put up an advertisement?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Advertisement?</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Wouldn't you get in trouble if someone found out I was using the Dokkaebi Bag?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung spoke bitterly, as if he was worried about something like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It's not illegal, and you're not the only one who benefits from the Dokkaebi Bag, so it doesn't matter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, the constellations didn't seem to mind that I was using the Dokkaebi Bag.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Pig Living in a Brick House' wonders what you'll buy.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Instead, they seemed to be watching with interest to see what I would buy. It was definitely a change of pace from the original novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, I've got everything I need.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Let's sign then.'</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The stream contract has concluded.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have received 1,000 coins as a down payment.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Plus an unspoken down payment.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is Bihyung actually a good guy?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe Kim Dokja, who turned his back on such an honest dokkaebi, was a worse bastard?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I have to go to another area, so contact me if you need anything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed that Bihyung had many other areas to pay attention to besides mine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was rather relieved.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It could mean that there were many surviving readers in this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Be careful.'</p>
<p class="orv_line">After the 'dokkaebi communication' was cut off, I immediately opened the 'Dokkaebi Bag'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The product search function is activated.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The product search function is limited to 5 times a day. Any additional searches will cost 100 coins per search.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The benefits of the bag are the same as in the original novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I made a list in my head of items I wanted to get ahead of time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ancient Dragon's Heart, Great Demon' Eyes. There were a few other items I'd created as settings, but the first thing to search for was this item.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The related product search is completed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The first item Kim Dokja gets in the main novel.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>*Purest Sword Force (白淸罡氣) - Stock: 0</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">No, it's already sold out?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, another reader could open the 'Dokkaebi Bag' first and bought it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I think Pinocchio."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly I heard a voice, so I reflexively turned around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was muttering something to me with a serious face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I wonder if he lied so hard that he grew a very long nose and escaped by blowing a hole in the whale's stomach?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at her blankly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't believe she was still thinking about Pinocchio.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's a good idea."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon narrowed her eyes at my praise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's not."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, it's a really good idea. It's kind of what I was going to do."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened the 'Dokkaebi Bag' again and searched for the items.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Mucus of the Hammer Seahorse' and 'Stone Hog's Pointed Thorn'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Both were items that Kim Dokja purchased to escape from the ichthyosaur.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the main story, Kim Dokja buys four of each of these items.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I bought eight of each.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[1,600 coins have been consumed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I was tempted to look up the other items, but I didn't have the coins to do so right now anyway.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stuck one of the thorns into my waistband with my ungainly right hand, then handed the remaining seven thorns and eight mucus bags to Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Take these."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked in surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Where did you get all of this from all of a sudden?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This is the key to Operation Pinocchio."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Again, I can't carry out this operation alone.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' is looking at you with interest.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Both my arms are crippled right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Therefore, I need someone else to insert the thorns into the stomach wall like Kim Dokja did.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked up at the digestive juices throughout the stomach wall and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"From now on, think of this thorn as Pinocchio's nose."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, I could borrow Kim Dokja's wisdom this time.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">That night, I had a dream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wasn't really trying to sleep, more like I passed out for a bit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Usually, when I have a dream, I say something along the lines of 'what did I dream'. If a pig appeared, it's a dream of a pig. If a dragon appeared, it's a dream of a dragon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well, I suppose you could give this dream a name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This dream,</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Cheon Inho. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a dream of a Kim Dokja.</p>
