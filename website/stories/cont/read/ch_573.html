<p class="orv_line">As I held my breath and calmly scanned my surroundings, I saw Jung Heewon&#39;s glimmering</p>
<p class="orv_line">figure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Completely unconscious, her body was sinking deeper into the water.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I paddled toward her with all my might, but I couldn&#39;t save her with my ligament-torn arm. There</p>
<p class="orv_line">was only one option.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I bit her arm hard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I choked as the river rushed into my mouth. I thought my eyeballs were going to fall out. Still, I</p>
<p class="orv_line">couldn&#39;t give up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Jung Heewon died here, this round would be over.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Slowly, the strength drained from my body. Even as my breathing faded, I didn&#39;t let go of her</p>

<p class="orv_line">Wake up, please.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that a strong splash of water came from somewhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As my breath caught in my throat, I saw a large monster coming toward us from the distance.</p>

<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi. Inho-ssi!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt something slap my cheek, and slowly came back to consciousness. The first thing I saw</p>
<p class="orv_line">when I opened my eyes was the blinding flash of a cell phone, and then Jung Heewon&#39;s face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Heewon-ssi?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ha...... Really.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon breathed a sigh of relief. As I staggered to my feet, the ground suddenly tilted and</p>
<p class="orv_line">shook.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon grabbed my shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Be careful, or we&#39;ll sink&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The river raged in the darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Upon closer inspection, I realized we were sitting on the remains of a small plastic structure. I</p>
<p class="orv_line">wondered if it was the remains of a sailboat used by the Han River rescue team.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The air was strangely humid. I turned on my phone&#39;s flash and saw a wall of crimson above,</p>
<p class="orv_line">below, and to the left.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the back of my mind, I remembered what happened before I lost consciousness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We had been eaten by an ichthyousaur.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You seem happy to have survived. We&#39;re about to die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I threw up water and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The light from my cell phone cast the shadows of the two of us against the crimson stomach of</p>
<p class="orv_line">the ichthyosaur.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Heewon-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Never mind.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon spoke without looking in my direction, as if she already knew what I was going to</p>
<p class="orv_line">say.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi, you&#39;re a bit of a weirdo.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m kind of like that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You always say weird things.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">First I said I loved her, then I said she&#39;s not even my colleague.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon must be confused.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I had a friend like Cheon Inho, I would have cut him off immediately.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m sorry, though. I didn&#39;t mean it. I thought he would let Heewon-ssi go if I told him so.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He&#39;s a psychopath, isn&#39;t he?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought for a moment before answering.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;A friend?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Not a friend.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I guess he&#39;s someone you know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded lightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was silent for a moment, as if she was thinking about something, and then she spoke up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;By the way, it hurts. How hard did you bite me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A human tooth mark was clearly visible on her right forearm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Embarrassed, I replied.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m glad you did it, though. I woke up because it really hurt.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you hurt anywhere else? The wound from the fight earlier—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s fine, it&#39;s a really shallow cut.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">......A shallow cut? From that &#39;Yoo Joonghyuk&#39;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Anyway, what should we do now? We&#39;re trapped.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I measured the size of the stomach surrounding us. Fortunately, it didn&#39;t seem to be the sea</p>
<p class="orv_line">commander that swallowed Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s for the best. We&#39;re safer here than in the Han River.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What if we melt with its digestive juices?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We need to escape before that happens.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How? We&#39;re not Pinocchio.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Pinocchio?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#39;t you know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, I know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Isn&#39;t she talking about the wooden puppet whose nose grows longer every time he lies?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, Pinocchio got eaten by a whale and escaped.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered reading that fairy tale a long time ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon seemed to think that we were in a similar situation.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Long-Nosed Liar&quot; nods.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at the message blankly, then snapped out of it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let me gather my thoughts for a moment, I think we need to come up with a plan.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Okay. What should I do?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well..... If you remember how Pinocchio escaped from the whale&#39;s stomach, tell me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you think that will help?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Just in case.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, Pinocchio didn&#39;t tell us how to escape from an ichthyosaur.</p>
「That will be Omniscient Reader.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">While Jung Heewon was seriously pondering, I closed my eyes and recalled the sequence of how</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja escaped from here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But in order to use this method, I needed someone&#39;s help.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Bihyung.&#39;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Soon, I felt the &#39;dokkaebi communication&#39; connect.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Hoo...... So this is how it turned out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung sounded dejected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I don&#39;t know why so many strange things are happening this season.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Have you considered my offer?&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I sent you a message saying I&#39;m signing the contract, didn&#39;t you get it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, a window popped up in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">----&lt;Stream Contract Agreement&gt;</p>
<p class="orv_line">1. Incarnation Cheon Inho (hereinafter referred to as gap) will sign a exclusive contract with the</p>
<p class="orv_line">dokkaebi Bihyung (hereinafter referred to as eul) untill all scenarios are completed or until his</p>
<p class="orv_line">death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">......</p>
<p class="orv_line">----It felt strange to see this contract again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—This is really special, I wasn&#39;t going to do it originally.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#39;t hard to figure out when Bihyung made up his mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Probably, right after seeing the confrontation between Yoo Joonghyuk and me. Judging by the</p>
<p class="orv_line">coins that came in earlier, I guess the constellations watched the confrontation with interest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly checked Bihyung&#39;s contract, checking off the oddities and crossing off the concessions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—You&#39;re pretty good at this, huh?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Because all contracts are similar.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, the &#39;Stream Contract Agreement&#39; looked a lot like the &#39;Management Contract Agreement&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I always sign.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I remembered my days as a rookie writer, when I was a victim of contract scams.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—The ratio is 8:2. You&#39;ll have 8 and I&#39;ll have 2.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;That&#39;s great by me, but isn&#39;t it supposed to be 7:3?&#39;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">—I saw how you did back then, so I thought it was okay to give you more.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was probably worried about losing me to another dokkaebi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A wise move, but it puts the hilt of the sword in my hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Well, while you&#39;re at it, I have one more favor to ask.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—No more ratio adjustments. This is the best I can do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Enough with the ratios, give me the scenario.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Scenario?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;There&#39;s a hidden scenario here.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung was speechless for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—How do you even know that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Does it matter?&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung sighed again, and muttered something to himself about the Bureau, probability and</p>
<p class="orv_line">sanctions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Well, yeah. There&#39;s a guy who already received this one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone already received this scenario?</p>
[A new hidden scenario has arrived!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I checked the scenario window.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Hidden Scenario - Serpent Slayer&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Hidden</p>
<p>Difficulty: B</p>
<p>Clear Conditions: Kill the ichthyosaur &#39;sea serpent&#39; and escape from its stomach.</p>
<p>Time Limit: 5 days</p>
<p>Reward: 4,000 coins</p>
<p>Failure: Death</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">The reward isn&#39;t as good as Kim Dokja&#39;s Hidden Scenario, but it&#39;s less challenging.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">This should be enough to get the injured me and Jung Heewon through.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—No more objections to the contract? Do you need anything else?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;You&#39;ll have to give me the right to use the Dokkaebi Bag.&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;Dokkaebi Bag&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, this was the biggest benefit from the &#39;stream contract&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung immediately pulled up the &#39;Dokkaebi Bag&#39;s screen in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Don&#39;t you have to put up an advertisement?&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Advertisement?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Wouldn&#39;t you get in trouble if someone found out I was using the Dokkaebi Bag?&#39;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung spoke bitterly, as if he was worried about something like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—It&#39;s not illegal, and you&#39;re not the only one who benefits from the Dokkaebi Bag, so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p class="orv_line">matter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, the constellations didn&#39;t seem to mind that I was using the Dokkaebi Bag.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Pig Living in a Brick House&#39; wonders what you&#39;ll buy.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Instead, they seemed to be watching with interest to see what I would buy. It was definitely a</p>
<p class="orv_line">change of pace from the original novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, I&#39;ve got everything I need.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Let&#39;s sign then.&#39;</p>
[The stream contract has concluded.]</p></div>
[You have received 1,000 coins as a down payment.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Plus an unspoken down payment.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is Bihyung actually a good guy?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe Kim Dokja, who turned his back on such an honest dokkaebi, was a worse bastard?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—I have to go to another area, so contact me if you need anything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed that Bihyung had many other areas to pay attention to besides mine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was rather relieved.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It could mean that there were many surviving readers in this world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Be careful.&#39;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">After the &#39;dokkaebi communication&#39; was cut off, I immediately opened the &#39;Dokkaebi Bag&#39;.</p>
[The product search function is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">coins per search.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The benefits of the bag are the same as in the original novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I made a list in my head of items I wanted to get ahead of time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ancient Dragon&#39;s Heart, Great Demon&#39; Eyes. There were a few other items I&#39;d created as settings,</p>
<p class="orv_line">but the first thing to search for was this item.</p>
[The related product search is completed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The first item Kim Dokja gets in the main novel.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>*Purest Sword Force (白淸罡氣) - Stock: 0</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">No, it&#39;s already sold out?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, another reader could open the &#39;Dokkaebi Bag&#39; first and bought it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think Pinocchio.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly I heard a voice, so I reflexively turned around.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was muttering something to me with a serious face.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I wonder if he lied so hard that he grew a very long nose and escaped by blowing a hole in the</p>
<p class="orv_line">whale&#39;s stomach?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at her blankly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#39;t believe she was still thinking about Pinocchio.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s a good idea.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon narrowed her eyes at my praise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s not.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, it&#39;s a really good idea. It&#39;s kind of what I was going to do.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened the &#39;Dokkaebi Bag&#39; again and searched for the items.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Mucus of the Hammer Seahorse&#39; and &#39;Stone Hog&#39;s Pointed Thorn&#39;.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Both were items that Kim Dokja purchased to escape from the ichthyosaur.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the main story, Kim Dokja buys four of each of these items.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I bought eight of each.</p>
[1,600 coins have been consumed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I was tempted to look up the other items, but I didn&#39;t have the coins to do so right now anyway.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stuck one of the thorns into my waistband with my ungainly right hand, then handed the</p>
<p class="orv_line">remaining seven thorns and eight mucus bags to Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Take these.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon asked in surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Where did you get all of this from all of a sudden?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is the key to Operation Pinocchio.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Again, I can&#39;t carry out this operation alone.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Sneaking Schemer&#39; is looking at you with interest.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Both my arms are crippled right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Therefore, I need someone else to insert the thorns into the stomach wall like Kim Dokja did.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked up at the digestive juices throughout the stomach wall and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;From now on, think of this thorn as Pinocchio&#39;s nose.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Luckily, I could borrow Kim Dokja&#39;s wisdom this time.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">That night, I had a dream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wasn&#39;t really trying to sleep, more like I passed out for a bit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Usually, when I have a dream, I say something along the lines of &#39;what did I dream&#39;. If a pig</p>
<p class="orv_line">appeared, it&#39;s a dream of a pig. If a dragon appeared, it&#39;s a dream of a dragon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well, I suppose you could give this dream a name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This dream,</p>
「Cheon Inho.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a dream of a Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Author&#39;s Note</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Oldest Dream?</p>
