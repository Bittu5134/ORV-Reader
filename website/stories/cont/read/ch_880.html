<p class="orv_line">"No, wait a minute."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was unfair. Because it wasn’t me who left Han Sooyoung alone for the 1,863rd round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m not an [Avatar]."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then what?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hesitated. I couldn’t think of anything I could say to persuade her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, a brief temptation occurred to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What if I just used [Incite]? If I used [Incite] to persuade Han Sooyoung to do my bidding.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I can hear your head spinning."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard Han Sooyoung’s laughter, I realized. The opponent in front of me wasn’t someone who could do that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was nothing I could do. From here on out, I had no choice but to play fair.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Just as you’re not the avatar of 'Han Sooyoung in the 3rd round', I’m not just Kim Dokja’s avatar."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung smiled as if she found it interesting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Really? How much of your memories did you inherit?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I barely received any memories."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yeah. They call someone like you [Avatar]. But isn't that right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Does the amount of memories you have matter? It's not the amount of memories that proves who I am."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung nodded and wrote something in her notebook.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I added while looking at Han Sooyoung like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Just because Han Sooyoung did something wrong in the third round, you wouldn't blame her for it. It's a bit unfair to blame me for Kim Dokja's mistakes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you trying to say that you're not that Kim Dokja?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. I'm not the Kim Dokja you know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then there's no reason for me to help you? Because you're not that Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is that really the case? Damn it. I quickly changed my subject.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But there's something called joint responsibility in this world. Since I'm also using Kim Dokja's name, I think I'm qualified to atone for his mistakes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja's joint responsibility.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It feels a bit unfair. If there is a responsibility for the Kim Dokja Solidarity, shouldn’t there also be benefits for the Kim Dokja Solidarity? But I’ve never received anything like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, I couldn’t complain to Han Sooyoung right in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung stared at me blankly and chuckled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How are you going to atone for this?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I cleared my throat slightly and began to speak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s all my fault. I’m sorry for leaving you alone. But I didn’t do it on purpose either."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung’s eyes shook subtly. I didn’t miss that moment and continued to speak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I was curious about your story too. I was curious about how you were doing, what you were thinking, and if something big had happened in your world."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn’t intentionally avoid visiting. I was just scared."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you scared?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sometimes, when it’s a story you really like, it’s scary to know the ending."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung quietly watched me like that, then glanced at Lee Seolhwa who was peeking at her from behind and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If someone saw me, they'd think I was doing this because I wanted an apology."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You weren't?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What would I do accepting something like that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then why are you upset?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was that too direct? Han Sooyoung's expression cracked for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't miss the opportunity and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you by any chance like Kim Dokja?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If that's not the case, there's no reason for you to be so upset. Weren't you and Kim Dokja just in a business relationship? You gave and took. You broke up cleanly."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Or did you actually want to go back to the third round with Kim Dokja?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung belatedly asked with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You're talking about having a pierced mouth, but have you forgotten who's holding the knife?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know. You’re holding on to it. And very tightly. So please spare me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh my."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you spare me, I’ll help you meet Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung paused for a moment and asked back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why do you think I want to meet that kid?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If not, I’m sorry, but that kid would really want to see you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung’s expression once again showed embarrassment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you keep talking nonsense…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Han Sooyoung."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsk tsk, sparks colored my incarnation body along with the sound. I decided to settle the matter before the aftermath grew any bigger.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja is in danger. Only you can save him."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja is in danger. I clearly saw the blue that spread across Han Sooyoung’s expression at those words. I was a little envious, and a little sorry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Can you take responsibility for that statement?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, I can take responsibility."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew how cowardly my words were.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I didn’t do anything, she would meet Kim Dokja again. More precisely, the less I did anything, the higher the probability that she would meet Kim Dokja again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was destined to become tIs123, and she would definitely meet the young Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, it wouldn’t be the kind of reunion she wanted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How is Kim Dokja in danger?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That is…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If I save you, you will tell me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I nodded, Han Sooyoung glared at me with a disapproving look and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I need to know who you made a contract with to come here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Will you help me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will listen to your story."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, the atmosphere was not bad. I swallowed a light sigh and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn’t make a contract with anyone."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn’t make an 'Otherworldly Covenant' to come here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is a possibility that an 'Otherworldly Covenant' that I don't know about has been activated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Strictly speaking, I came here through the 'Fear Realm', and the owner of the 'Fear Realm' was the 'King of Fear'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'King of Fear' held numerous otherworldly deities, so it would be safe to say that the 'Fear Realm' itself was an 'Otherworldly Covenant'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the 'Fear Realm' has now been destroyed, and the 'King of Fear' has lost his power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, the 'contract' that sent me here has lost its effect. However, Han Sooyoung's expression upon hearing my words was strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait a minute, then you—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, thunder rang out from outside the window. Han Sooyoung's eyebrows furrowed and Lee Seolhwa opened the curtains by the window almost at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Captain, something is strange!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung's shout from outside. There was a huge portal swirling in the sky outside the window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I and Han Sooyoung knew what it was.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Great Hall. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A passageway to another world was about to open in the vast expanse of sky. A tremendous feast could be felt beyond the hall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung glared at me with a frown.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What on earth have you done?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked up at the sky in confusion.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Even if it was the 1,863rd round, there’s no way a 'god of another world' would suddenly descend in the clear sky. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The scale of probability eventually shifted toward offsetting its weight.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If a god of another world had appeared, it meant that there was a 'probability' that he would descend in this world line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart sank.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 It’s because of me. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Up until now, my existence had been protected by a 'scenario'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Management Bureau does not accept your existence.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, there was no scenario assigned to me in this worldline. In other words, the current me was an existence that was not needed in the 'scenario'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsut!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The spark that was immediately felt in my incarnation body was the proof.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This worldline does not consider my existence 'probable'. Therefore, in order to protect the probability of this world, my existence must disappear.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Ooooooooooo.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Therefore, the guy coming over from the 'Great Hall' right now was a kind of grim reaper that came to erase me from this world.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【IwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantit.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung didn't panic and just flicked her fingers in the air.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['True Word Defense System' is activating!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt something like a transparent membrane surrounding the headquarters. Surprisingly, the defense barrier was withstanding the true words of that distant outer god.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kugugugugu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But as the size of the 'Great Hall' growing in the sky grew, the shaking of the defense barrier also increased.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung glared at me and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you know what you did?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You're apologizing for bringing something like that? Lee Seolhwa, did you finish measuring its level?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Seolhwa, who was waiting nearby, shook her head and answered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The story measuring device is broken."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It was fine until the last time you measured the 'Dream Eater', right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's level is higher than that time."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then it's at least 'Old Existence' level or higher. What's its true name?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn't figure it out."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hmm."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung's expression became very serious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The final scenario is right around the corner, and because of this kid, the Earth could be destroyed."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded calmly and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm really sorry. So please help me, Han Sooyoung."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung grumbled as if she was dumbfounded by my words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This is really shameless."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You don't have a choice anyway. If you don't help me, your worldline will be destroyed."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What do you want me to help you with?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Please help me return to the 41st round."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I said before, there are several conditions needed to 'move worldlines' in this world. However, I wasn't Yoo Joonghyuk, and I didn't have an 'ark' to cross worldlines like the constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So now, the only thing left for me is the last method.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will make an Otherworldly Covenant."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Will that work now?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why not?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"With that kind of thing targeting you right now, do you think there would be an Outer God that wants to make an 'Otherwordly Covenant' with you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The otherworldly deity that is making an 'Otherworldly Covenant' right now will definitely clash with the outer god targeting me from beyond the 'Great Hall'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, only a being stronger than the 'otherworldly deity' targeting me would accept my offer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If the guy over there is stronger than the 'old being', then there is a possibility that he is at the level of the 'great old being'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Great old being.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I kept my mouth shut at that expression that I had finally heard. Han Sooyoung added, how she had taken my silence unknown.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If the guy over there is at the 'great old being' level, then there will be no outer god that will help you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew it too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The outer god that reaches the 'great old being' level is a kind of 'mythical constellation' among the outer gods.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, I shook my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, it's not like there's no one."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if the being that covets me from beyond is a 'Great Old Being', it's not like there's no Outer Deity that can stand against it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You, really."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung's expression as she looked at me was strangely hardened. Perhaps she had realized it too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The being that brought you to this 'worldline'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only being that can stand against a 'Great Old Being' is a 'Great Old Being'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took a deep breath and opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Han Sooyoung, please call 'Secretive Plotter'."</p>
