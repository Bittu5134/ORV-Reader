<p class="orv_line">A full level 5 Armed Zone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With Gong Pildu&#x27;s cool artillery barrage, all the ground rats in front of him were silenced.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dududududu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ground rats stepped on the corpses of their comrades and continued to push forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We&#x27;re being pushed! Watch out!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Less than ten minutes later, the front row of the fort collapsed. As the ground rats squeezed in</p>
<p class="orv_line">through the gap, several panicked people screamed and broke ranks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No! Keep your place! Don&#x27;t run!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">One man was bitten on the arm and dragged forward like a fish on a hook.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Uaaaagh!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He reached out belatedly, but was sucked into the mischief of ground rats. The screams didn&#x27;t</p>
<p class="orv_line">last long.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein&#x27;s shoulders shook slightly as he[1] stood in the front row.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">She said, watching as someone else filled the dead man&#x27;s place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;To be honest, it didn&#x27;t feel real until now.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was blood spattered and screams everywhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">People were still dying as we spoke. People who hadn&#x27;t even been properly named.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I couldn&#x27;t believe it even when I saw people die after coming into the novel. In fact, I kept</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">thinking maybe I was dreaming, and by the time I woke up, I would open my eyes again in my</p>
<p class="orv_line">bed. That&#x27;s what I thought.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Another person died, and another filled the void.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But now I realize.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein said, shaking off a charging ground rat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I really don&#x27;t want to die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought I knew why he had suddenly changed his mind. Perhaps it was because things had</p>
<p class="orv_line">changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I want to survive...... I want to survive and I want to go back home.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was because he had such hope that he could return to the original world.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Prevent its predestined destruction and develop a new story.」</div>「Prevent its predestined destruction and develop a new story.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m going to break all the scenarios somehow and go home.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He stabbed a ground rat to death with a thorn after it crossed the line of fire.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killing, killing, killing again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know how many he&#x27;s already killed in that short time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Catching his breath, Kyung Sein said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As soon as I get back, I&#x27;m going to turn on my computer. I&#x27;m going to write on the bulletin</p>
<p class="orv_line">board. I&#x27;m going to brag about it. In fact, I was transmigrated into Omniscient Reader.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;......That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going to do as soon as you get back?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s where I saw Jung Heewon, I saw Cheon Inho, I met Yoo Joonghyuk. No one will believe</p>
<p class="orv_line">me, but one day I&#x27;ll definitely tell them.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">While he was still trying to figure out what to say, the man in front of him died. He didn&#x27;t</p>
<p class="orv_line">hesitate to fill the void.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And I&#x27;ll definitely read Omniscient Reader&#x27;s extrastoo. The author-nim said he was going to</p>
<p class="orv_line">publish a series.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I might be the first one to turn on the computer when I get back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We&#x27;re being pushed again! Molotov cocktails ready!&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">As the second column of the fort began to gradually push back, Ye Hyunwoo gave the first</p>
<p class="orv_line">signal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Several men in the rear fished out empty soju bottles from their pockets.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Throw them!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At Ye Hyunwoo&#x27;s command, Molotov cocktails flew through the air. Gasoline sprayed from the</p>
<p class="orv_line">broken soju bottles and set the center of the platform ablaze.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kieeee!</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the panicked ground rats scrambled around, Gong Pildu&#x27;s shells rained down on them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He had prepared Molotov cocktails in such a short time. Indeed, the 7th Apostle wasn&#x27;t a joke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#x27;t be pushed back! It will take a long time to rebuild the [Armed Zone]!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The core of this siege is Gong Pildu&#x27;s [Armed Zone].</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the line collapsed further, [Armed Zone] would have to be dismantled, but the current power</p>
<p class="orv_line">was not enough to fill the firepower gap.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the ground rats slowed their advance, albeit slightly, the man guarding the front fort looked</p>
<p class="orv_line">back and shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;More Molotov cocktails! We&#x27;ll push the line and burn them all to a crisp!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something burst through the man&#x27;s stomach.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the horn of an 8th grade underground species, a groll.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Keok, Keoheook! Kuaaaak!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;P-pull it out! Quickly!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Elder Pildu! Help!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Everyone out of the way!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dududududu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The groll, who had the man on its head, was shot and began to fly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From the 8th grade species onwards, they were hardly knocked down by Gong Pildu&#x27;s bullets.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A monster that needed at least four or five shots to fall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There wasn&#x27;t just one such monster. They were popping up all over the platform, racing toward</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">the fort like heavy tanks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To make matters worse, Gong Pildu&#x27;s artillery stopped firing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Shit, I have to reload! Everyone, hold on for time!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The line was about to collapse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sein-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was finally our turn to move forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Kyung Sein, who had the OP skill [Average Correction] and went all in on physique, held his</p>
<p class="orv_line">fire with a cheer, Dansoo ahjussi sent a flurry of cockroaches over the groll&#x27;s eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kuooo?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon&#x27;s sword sliced through its back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The groll&#x27;s head snapped off.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As three or four grolls fell in quick succession, the reloaded bullets of Gong Pildu swept across</p>
<p class="orv_line">the platform.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dududududu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The monsters in front of them were swept away by the firepower of the [mini turrets]. The</p>
<p class="orv_line">people cheered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Those guys are pretty good, huh?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Everyone, protect Pildu hyung-nim!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We can do it. Hold on!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The crisis had been averted for now, but the situation was far from optimistic.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only thirty minutes had passed. Gong Pildu&#x27;s face was already exhausted. He was running out of</p>
<p class="orv_line">energy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the Omniscient Reader, Kim Dokja gave him a large amount of Intermediate Magic Power</p>
<p class="orv_line">Recovery Potion to replenish his magic power, but now.......</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Defense Master&#x27; is making a worried face.]</div>[The constellation 'Defense Master' is making a worried face.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">A little more time passed, the number of ground rats getting back to their feet after being hit by</p>
<p class="orv_line">shells begins to increase.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder if I should open the &#x27;dokkaebi bag&#x27; now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kid.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu wiped the sweat from his forehead and called out to Ye Hyunwoo. Without a word,</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo walked up behind Gong Pildu and stood with his hands clasped together, his small</p>
<p class="orv_line">body enveloped in a brilliant blue light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately recognized the skill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Instead of restricting one&#x27;s movement, it speeds up the magic power recovery.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Immediately, I could feel the magic power boiling up from Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uuuung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first glance, that&#x27;s a lot of magic power, well over level 30.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#x27;s a lot of magic power for just the third scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was clear that he had put aside all his strength, agility, and physique and went all in on magic</p>
<p class="orv_line">power. It was a choice no one in their right mind would make.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Here we go. Ahjussi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Ye Hyunwoo&#x27;s small hand touched Gong Pildu&#x27;s back, a faint string of magic</p>
<p class="orv_line">formed between him and Gong Pildu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the same way that Yoo Joonghyuk transferred his magic power to Kim Dokja when he</p>
<p class="orv_line">fought the &#x27;Disaster of Questions&#x27; Myung Ilsang in the original.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Soon, an abundance of magic power began to flow throughout Gong Pildu&#x27;s Private Property.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The speed of the [mini turrets], which had been slowed down, returned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dududududu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo was now using himself as a &#x27;magic power tank&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is the fourth stage of the &#x27;Armed Castellan at Home&#x27; Techtree.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">After locking eyes with me, Ye Hyunwoo wiped the sweat from his brow and said in a confident</p>
<p class="orv_line">voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is the &#x27;Infinite Uroboros&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">A combination of high-level magic power, [Magic Power Recharge], [Magic Power Sharing],</p>
<p class="orv_line">and [Armed Zone].</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was amazed at the precision of the mechanics, but I was also stunned that a human being could</p>
<p class="orv_line">actually do this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#x27;m sure Kim Dokja would have been just as surprised if he were here.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation who hasn&#x27;t revealed their modifier is amazed.]</div>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is amazed.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye, who was watching us from the back stairwell, whistled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wow, that&#x27;s awesome? I wish I had one like that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the firing rate of the [mini turrets] increased, the battle gained momentum.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon and Kyung Sein were enough to fight the occasional grolls, leaving the remaining</p>
<p class="orv_line">hands free to rebuild the collapsed fort.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The men working on the new molotov cocktails muttered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is better than I thought?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yeah, if it goes like this, it&#x27;ll be a smooth-&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, wait.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[&#x27;Emergency Defense Battle&#x27; has entered a new phase.]</div>['Emergency Defense Battle' has entered a new phase.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The message echoed in the air as if it had been waiting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if the word &#x27;smooth&#x27; should be filtered out from Omniscient Reader.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new monster species has appeared in &#x27;Emergency Defense Battle&#x27;!]</div>[A new monster species has appeared in 'Emergency Defense Battle'!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">A message that never appeared in the original. In the first place, the Emergency Defense Battle is</p>
<p class="orv_line">not a scenario that had different phases.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A 7th grade monster species has appeared!]</div>[A 7th grade monster species has appeared!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">A huge shadow flickered from the railroad tracks. The sound of a subway car scraping across the</p>
<p class="orv_line">ground. I could feel the ground shaking under my feet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What, what, what is that!&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#x27;t the subway that had emerged from the tunnel. It was a large monster, at least 15 meters</p>
<p class="orv_line">long.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Giant Centipede&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the sight of the hundreds of legs beneath its five-colored carapace, the men lost their fighting</p>
<p class="orv_line">spirit and rushed toward Gong Pildu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Uaaaak! Crazy!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;H-how are I supposed to catch that thing—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It can be caught. Yoo Joonghyuk would be able to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only problem is, he&#x27;s not here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced over and saw that Ye Hyunwoo&#x27;s expression was also stony. It was natural to panic.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It must mean he was out of tricks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stepped forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We&#x27;ll take it from here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Do you have a plan?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We&#x27;ll have to fight it head on and kill it, I guess.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Like that? How?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#x27;t know...... By stabbing it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I...... Inho-ssi. I don&#x27;t know how many times you&#x27;ve read it, but that&#x27;s not just a 7th grade</p>
<p class="orv_line">monster species, it&#x27;s a &#x27;king&#x27;. It&#x27;s a monster that even the 4th stage of my Invincible Castellan</p>
<p class="orv_line">techtree can&#x27;t handle. I&#x27;m telling you as someone who read it 50 times—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced to the side instead of answering. Jung Heewon, who had just decapitated a monster,</p>
<p class="orv_line">was approaching.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Heewon-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wiping the blood from her ground rat knife, Jung Heewon nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hide well, I can&#x27;t protect you this time.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">She tapped me on the shoulder and walked away.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo, who was looking at her blankly, smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Jung Heewon, I know, she&#x27;s the best in Kimcom in terms of combat power, but even she can&#x27;t</p>
<p class="orv_line">do it now—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, I also have a techtree that I&#x27;ve prepared.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Actually, I didn&#x27;t have anything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But things don&#x27;t always go well when you have something prepared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the same when I was writing novels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sometimes the episodes I&#x27;ve written with ideas I had in the spur of the moment were way more</p>
<p class="orv_line">interesting than the ones I&#x27;ve planned a hundred days in advance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s see.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was such an &#x27;idea&#x27; for me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[All of the constellations in the channel agree to the use of &#x27;Hour of Judgment&#x27;.]</div>[All of the constellations in the channel agree to the use of 'Hour of Judgment'.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">Scattering dazzling brilliance, Jung Heewon rushed towards the centipede.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at Jung Heewon like that, I thought to myself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this whole scenario were to end and I could return to reality.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Maybe I would be writing about this moment.」</div>「Maybe I would be writing about this moment.」</p>
