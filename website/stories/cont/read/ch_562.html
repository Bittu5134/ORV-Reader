            <div class="orv_title"><h1>562 Episode 2. Rewrite (7)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">While writing Omniscient Reader, there were a few times when the plot would break down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A character would suddenly speak in a historical drama style, or they would forget a skill (or more accurately, I would forget it).</p>
<p class="orv_line">I apologized to my readers and made changes to save the day.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what I did this time was impossible to fix.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's praise the germs who made a significant sacrifice for us."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's not enough that I've had a profound impact on the cult's religious views, but I'm also involved in the re-emergence of the Ten Evils.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh— germs, germs, bacterias."</p>
<p class="orv_line">What the hell have you done, Lee Hakhyun?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reader ahjussi next to me was clapping his hands with the wrong beat, unaware of what was going on.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your influence in this scenario area is significant.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'view of life' you spread dominates the religious views in the area.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if I'd rather be on the wrong side of the tracks and be a villain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was not a wise idea.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh— the great sacrifice of the germs."</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I ran into Yoo Joonghyuk while doing something like this, I would be decapitated with a single blow.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Lee Hyunjoo' believes in you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Im Baekhoon' believes in you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Yeom Youngcheol' believes in you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Still, I didn't feel too bad that everyone believed in me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I've never had so many people believe in me in my life.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Most of the incarnations in the area are moved by your words.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After one hymn, the tension eased, and people sat around the campfire in a circle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A few people sipped canned drinks from the vending machine, talked, and prayed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Isn't this supposed to kill germs? Lactobacillus acidophilus is also a bacterium. I hear no one makes it to the intestines alive."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Where were you going, ahjumma?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I was just on my way to pick up my son's yogurt. What about you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I had dinner plans with my girlfriend."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, that's funny, because I was just on my way to go to see the chicken restaurant I opened with my wife, and then this tragedy......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Others handed me a canned drink and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Bacteria are also living things, this is the first time I've realized it. Wow, young people are so smart."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You should study well. Where did you go to college?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't answer, just smiled meaninglessly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a speech by Life Leader Kim Cheolyang, both religious and non-religious people had a strange look on their faces.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They say that religion is a drug to overcome death, and maybe that's true.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, not everyone was high on it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you all crazy? There's a surefire way to live, but you're going to let it go?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not surprisingly, it was the big guy. He had something like a pipe in his hand; I didn't know where he got it from.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't see him for a moment, then I realized he'd been searching through the station for it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you want to get fucked, get fucked alone."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The people's faces tensed as the weaponized big guy approached.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait a minute, what's wrong with you? You burned your socks earlier."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Naive assholes. You really believe it's killing if you kill something you can't even see or tell if it's dead or not?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, so what?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Have you forgotten what that monster showed us earlier? The surest way to get out of here alive."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The big pipe pointed at the people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kill someone here, and you'll be sure to live."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' is chuckling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I think I know what's going on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, one of the constellations encouraged him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at the big guy and activated [Character List.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Character List' is activated!]</p></div>

</div>
<p class="orv_line">The boss of the 'Cheoldoo Group', Lee Cheoldoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't until I read the description that I realized who this guy was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, there was a group called 'Cheoldoo' at Geumho Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Cheoldoo Group's boss wasn't in the original story of 'Omniscient Reader', but I had created a setting for it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took a step forward and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't panic. We're in a group, and he's alone."</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how many weapons Lee Cheoldoo had, or whether he was the Cheoldoo Group's boss, he couldn't fight against twenty-one people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Lee Cheoldoo didn't let up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Whoa, wait a minute. Kill you all? I only have to kill one of you. From these 27..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As he scanned the faces of the people, one by one, as if he was picking out the weakest bug, he glanced in my direction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's be honest with each other, you're all scared to death of believing that bastard too, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Cheoldoo laughed lightly and slapped his pipe with his palm as if he understood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"First ten people. Stick to my side, and I'll take responsibility and save you no matter what."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He took another step forward, adding.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The rest of you, be prepared to die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Everyone took a step back as Lee Cheoldoo approached.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Cheolyang panicked and shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't listen to him, everyone. We've already won the right to survive! There's no need to fight unnecessarily!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, the enraged people shouted in unison.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's right, you killed the germs too! You can live if you stay still, why are you doing this?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Maybe you don't get it yet, but it's okay now? You can live because you killed the germs."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, killing bugs and germs together created a sense of camaraderie, and the unity of the people wasn't bad.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The incarnations in the area are united.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The influence of the religious view is growing stronger.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Cheoldoo scratched his ears in disbelief and became irritated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You're really crazy. Then let's just have one of you die to me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"D-don't panic, if we all fight togetherᅳ"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't care how many of you there are."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Cheoldoo's pipe hissed and scraped the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You'll die in the order you come."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The people backed away in horror.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If everyone pitched in, they might be able to subdue him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, no one was willing to step forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As he searched for a target, Lee Cheoldoo's eyes landed on the man closest to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Realizing that he had been targeted, he called out to the surrounding area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"H-help me, please! Help me!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">But no one tried to help him. The crowd quickly backed away like a swarm of bugs that had been discovered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Cheoldoo raised his pipe as if he knew that would happen.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Kim Haemoon' is panicking!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"S-save me! I'll stick with you!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Character Kim Haemoon. He had been passive ever since he killed the bug.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Cheoldoo said fiercely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, I don't need you anymore."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Please, please! I'll give you 100 million if we get out of here, I can even send you the money right now!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Cheoldoo frowned as he thought for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"100 million. Then you decide who to kill."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Haemoon looked at the others with trembling eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first person he looked at was the ahjumma who said she was going to give her son yogurt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was the first to run away when Lee Cheoldoo turned toward Kim Haemoon.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Lee Hyekyung' is terrified.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"W-why are you looking at me! I have to live, my child is waiting for me!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Haemoon's head turned to look at the man next to her. It was the young man who had dinner plans with his girlfriend.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Jeong Hancheol' is looking around.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jeong Hancheol quickly looked back and forth between Kim Haemoon and Lee Cheoldoo, and gave a small, friendly smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Can I be on your side?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Haemoon's head snapped back to the middle-aged man beside him.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Ji Hyungdong' is freaking out.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This time, it was the man who said he opened a chicken restaurant with his wife.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I walked over to him, thinking it was a bad idea. The time limit was about to expire, so I had to drag it out somehow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But when he saw me, Ji Hyungdong pointed at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I-If you're going to kill someone, kill him! He made this whole thing happen!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first, I thought I had misheard him, but then people started chattering around me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's right. He made the situation like situation, he should be held accountable."</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were obviously friendly people until a while ago.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"W-why are you looking at us like that? He's not wrong."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What's wrong with you, young man? Fight. Fight and win."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"At times like these, you step up like a man!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">My breathing became stifled, as if I were the bug trapped in my pocket.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Cheoldoo smiled at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Okay, you'll work."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In an instant, the surroundings became silent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned around, people began to avoid my eyes as if they had made a promise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even without [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint], it was obvious what they were thinking.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 As long as it's not me. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I wasn't surprised.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I already knew this was their nature.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at the approaching Lee Cheoldoo and thought to myself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Avarage physique, strength and agility of 7.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder if I can beat him.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There are 5 minutes remaining.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Let's just hold on for five minutes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at Kim Cheolyang for the last time. He looked at my pupils and made a complicated expression.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Kim Cheolyang' is very troubled.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Kim Cheolyang' is a person whose 'sentence' you wrote yourself.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have a very good understanding of the character.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't have [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint], but Kim Cheolyang's internal thoughts echoed in my ears.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 There are three people who have influence in this station right now. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Me, the narrow eyes man, and the big guy. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Cheolyang's eyes quickly switched between me and the big guy.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 If I don't stop him, he'll die. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I don't think he's going to listen to me. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 If I don't succeed, I'll....... 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Quickly changing his posture, Kim Cheolyang took a step away from me with the people and shouted loudly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't move rashly, everyone, stand back. God's emissary is about to get redemption(代贖) for us."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Cheolyang is a man who fears his power being threatened. If he can't stop the beast anyway, he'd rather take advantage of the situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A way to strengthen his position and justify my death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No matter how insignificant, a life is a life. Right now, God's emissary is going to sacrifice himself to atone for killing the bacterial brothers. Let's all say thank you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was ridiculous, but the people's eyes were already filled with madness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They, too, had agreed to sacrifice me for their own survival.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jeong Hancheol and Ji Hyungdong whispered as they retreated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Germs are living beings, you could have just looked it up on the Internet. It's not like it's a big deal. You'd have figured it out eventually, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's not get into this, let's stay neutral. There's a reason he's so upset."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was still calm.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 No writer is ever surprised by their own words. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Cheoldoo's shadow was cast on the spot where the others had retreated. The feet that had been relentlessly trampling on the bug turned toward me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If it's decided, the rest of you get lost. I'm only going to kill this asshole, as promised. Hey, get out of my way."</p>
<p class="orv_line">People at a short distance were beaten on the arms and legs with the pipe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aaaak! My arm!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't be stupid, come over here quickly! Only one person needs to die!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The terrified people quickly ran to the scenario barrier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just like that, everyone was far away from my side.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There are 3 minutes remaining.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Only one person, the one person who hadn't run away, was still with me for this ending.</p>
