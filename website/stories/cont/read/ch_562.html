<p class="orv_line">While writing Omniscient Reader, there were a few times when the plot would break down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A character would suddenly speak in a historical drama style, or they would forget a skill (or</p>
<p class="orv_line">more accurately, I would forget it).</p>
<p class="orv_line">I apologized to my readers and made changes to save the day.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But what I did this time was impossible to fix.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#39;s praise the germs who made a significant sacrifice for us.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s not enough that I&#39;ve had a profound impact on the cult&#39;s religious views, but I&#39;m also involved</p>
<p class="orv_line">in the re-emergence of the Ten Evils.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh— germs, germs, bacterias.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">What the hell have you done, Lee Hakhyun?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reader ahjussi next to me was clapping his hands with the wrong beat, unaware of what was</p>
<p class="orv_line">going on.</p>
[Your influence in this scenario area is significant.]</p></div>
[The &#39;view of life&#39; you spread dominates the religious views in the area.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I wondered if I&#39;d rather be on the wrong side of the tracks and be a villain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was not a wise idea.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh— the great sacrifice of the germs.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I ran into Yoo Joonghyuk while doing something like this, I would be decapitated with a single</p>
<p class="orv_line">blow.</p>
[The character &#39;Lee Hyunjoo&#39; believes in you.]</p></div>
[The character &#39;Im Baekhoon&#39; believes in you.]</p></div>
[The character &#39;Yeom Youngcheol&#39; believes in you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Still, I didn&#39;t feel too bad that everyone believed in me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#39;ve never had so many people believe in me in my life.</p>
[Most of the incarnations in the area are moved by your words.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After one hymn, the tension eased, and people sat around the campfire in a circle.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">A few people sipped canned drinks from the vending machine, talked, and prayed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Isn&#39;t this supposed to kill germs? Lactobacillus acidophilus is also a bacterium. I hear no one</p>
<p class="orv_line">makes it to the intestines alive.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Where were you going, ahjumma?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I was just on my way to pick up my son&#39;s yogurt. What about you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I had dinner plans with my girlfriend.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, that&#39;s funny, because I was just on my way to go to see the chicken restaurant I opened</p>
<p class="orv_line">with my wife, and then this tragedy.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Others handed me a canned drink and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Bacteria are also living things, this is the first time I&#39;ve realized it. Wow, young people are so</p>
<p class="orv_line">smart.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You should study well. Where did you go to college?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t answer, just smiled meaninglessly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a speech by Life Leader Kim Cheolyang, both religious and non-religious people had a</p>
<p class="orv_line">strange look on their faces.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They say that religion is a drug to overcome death, and maybe that&#39;s true.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, not everyone was high on it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you all crazy? There&#39;s a surefire way to live, but you&#39;re going to let it go?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Not surprisingly, it was the big guy. He had something like a pipe in his hand; I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p class="orv_line">where he got it from.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#39;t see him for a moment, then I realized he&#39;d been searching through the station for it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you want to get fucked, get fucked alone.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The people&#39;s faces tensed as the weaponized big guy approached.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait a minute, what&#39;s wrong with you? You burned your socks earlier.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Naive assholes. You really believe it&#39;s killing if you kill something you can&#39;t even see or tell if</p>
<p class="orv_line">it&#39;s dead or not?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, so what?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Have you forgotten what that monster showed us earlier? The surest way to get out of here</p>
<p class="orv_line">alive.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The big pipe pointed at the people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Kill someone here, and you&#39;ll be sure to live.&quot;</p>
[The constellation &#39;Monarch of the Small Fries&#39; is chuckling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I think I know what&#39;s going on.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, one of the constellations encouraged him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at the big guy and activated [Character List.]</p>

<p>a powerful headbutting technique.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">The boss of the &#39;Cheoldoo Group&#39;, Lee Cheoldoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#39;t until I read the description that I realized who this guy was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come to think of it, there was a group called &#39;Cheoldoo&#39; at Geumho Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Cheoldoo Group&#39;s boss wasn&#39;t in the original story of &#39;Omniscient Reader&#39;, but I had created</p>
<p class="orv_line">a setting for it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took a step forward and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#39;t panic. We&#39;re in a group, and he&#39;s alone.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how many weapons Lee Cheoldoo had, or whether he was the Cheoldoo Group&#39;s boss,</p>
<p class="orv_line">he couldn&#39;t fight against twenty-one people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Lee Cheoldoo didn&#39;t let up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Whoa, wait a minute. Kill you all? I only have to kill one of you. From these 27...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As he scanned the faces of the people, one by one, as if he was picking out the weakest bug, he</p>
<p class="orv_line">glanced in my direction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#39;s be honest with each other, you&#39;re all scared to death of believing that bastard too, aren&#39;t</p>
<p class="orv_line">you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Cheoldoo laughed lightly and slapped his pipe with his palm as if he understood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;First ten people. Stick to my side, and I&#39;ll take responsibility and save you no matter what.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">He took another step forward, adding.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The rest of you, be prepared to die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Everyone took a step back as Lee Cheoldoo approached.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Cheolyang panicked and shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#39;t listen to him, everyone. We&#39;ve already won the right to survive! There&#39;s no need to fight</p>
<p class="orv_line">unnecessarily!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then, the enraged people shouted in unison.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s right, you killed the germs too! You can live if you stay still, why are you doing this?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe you don&#39;t get it yet, but it&#39;s okay now? You can live because you killed the germs.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, killing bugs and germs together created a sense of camaraderie, and the unity of the people</p>
<p class="orv_line">wasn&#39;t bad.</p>
[The incarnations in the area are united.]</p></div>
[The influence of the religious view is growing stronger.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Cheoldoo scratched his ears in disbelief and became irritated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;re really crazy. Then let&#39;s just have one of you die to me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;D-don&#39;t panic, if we all fight togetherᅳ&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t care how many of you there are.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Cheoldoo&#39;s pipe hissed and scraped the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;ll die in the order you come.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The people backed away in horror.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If everyone pitched in, they might be able to subdue him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, no one was willing to step forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As he searched for a target, Lee Cheoldoo&#39;s eyes landed on the man closest to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Realizing that he had been targeted, he called out to the surrounding area.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;H-help me, please! Help me!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">But no one tried to help him. The crowd quickly backed away like a swarm of bugs that had been</p>
<p class="orv_line">discovered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Cheoldoo raised his pipe as if he knew that would happen.</p>
[The character &#39;Kim Haemoon&#39; is panicking!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;S-save me! I&#39;ll stick with you!&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Character Kim Haemoon. He had been passive ever since he killed the bug.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Cheoldoo said fiercely.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, I don&#39;t need you anymore.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Please, please! I&#39;ll give you 100 million if we get out of here, I can even send you the money</p>
<p class="orv_line">right now!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Cheoldoo frowned as he thought for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;100 million. Then you decide who to kill.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Haemoon looked at the others with trembling eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first person he looked at was the ahjumma who said she was going to give her son yogurt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was the first to run away when Lee Cheoldoo turned toward Kim Haemoon.</p>
[The character &#39;Lee Hyekyung&#39; is terrified.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;W-why are you looking at me! I have to live, my child is waiting for me!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Haemoon&#39;s head turned to look at the man next to her. It was the young man who had dinner</p>
<p class="orv_line">plans with his girlfriend.</p>
[The character &#39;Jeong Hancheol&#39; is looking around.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jeong Hancheol quickly looked back and forth between Kim Haemoon and Lee Cheoldoo, and</p>
<p class="orv_line">gave a small, friendly smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Can I be on your side?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Haemoon&#39;s head snapped back to the middle-aged man beside him.</p>
[The character &#39;Ji Hyungdong&#39; is freaking out.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This time, it was the man who said he opened a chicken restaurant with his wife.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I walked over to him, thinking it was a bad idea. The time limit was about to expire, so I had to</p>
<p class="orv_line">drag it out somehow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But when he saw me, Ji Hyungdong pointed at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I-If you&#39;re going to kill someone, kill him! He made this whole thing happen!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At first, I thought I had misheard him, but then people started chattering around me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s right. He made the situation like situation, he should be held accountable.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were obviously friendly people until a while ago.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;W-why are you looking at us like that? He&#39;s not wrong.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you, young man? Fight. Fight and win.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;At times like these, you step up like a man!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">My breathing became stifled, as if I were the bug trapped in my pocket.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Cheoldoo smiled at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Okay, you&#39;ll work.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In an instant, the surroundings became silent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned around, people began to avoid my eyes as if they had made a promise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even without [Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint], it was obvious what they were thinking.</p>
「As long as it&#39;s not me.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I wasn&#39;t surprised.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I already knew this was their nature.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at the approaching Lee Cheoldoo and thought to myself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Avarage physique, strength and agility of 7.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder if I can beat him.</p>
[There are 5 minutes remaining.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Let&#39;s just hold on for five minutes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at Kim Cheolyang for the last time. He looked at my pupils and made a complicated</p>
<p class="orv_line">expression.</p>
[The character &#39;Kim Cheolyang&#39; is very troubled.]</p></div>
[The character &#39;Kim Cheolyang&#39; is a person whose &#39;sentence&#39; you wrote yourself.]</p></div>
[You have a very good understanding of the character.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t have [Omniscient Reader&#39;s Viewpoint], but Kim Cheolyang&#39;s internal thoughts echoed in</p>
<p class="orv_line">my ears.</p>
「There are three people who have influence in this station right now.」</p></div>
「Me, the narrow eyes man, and the big guy.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Cheolyang&#39;s eyes quickly switched between me and the big guy.</p>
「If I don&#39;t stop him, he&#39;ll die.」</p></div>
「I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to listen to me.」</p></div>
「If I don&#39;t succeed, I&#39;ll.......」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Quickly changing his posture, Kim Cheolyang took a step away from me with the people and</p>
<p class="orv_line">shouted loudly.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#39;t move rashly, everyone, stand back. God&#39;s emissary is about to get redemption(代贖) for</p>
<p class="orv_line">us.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Cheolyang is a man who fears his power being threatened. If he can&#39;t stop the beast anyway,</p>
<p class="orv_line">he&#39;d rather take advantage of the situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A way to strengthen his position and justify my death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No matter how insignificant, a life is a life. Right now, God&#39;s emissary is going to sacrifice</p>
<p class="orv_line">himself to atone for killing the bacterial brothers. Let&#39;s all say thank you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was ridiculous, but the people&#39;s eyes were already filled with madness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They, too, had agreed to sacrifice me for their own survival.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jeong Hancheol and Ji Hyungdong whispered as they retreated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Germs are living beings, you could have just looked it up on the Internet. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s a big</p>
<p class="orv_line">deal. You&#39;d have figured it out eventually, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#39;s not get into this, let&#39;s stay neutral. There&#39;s a reason he&#39;s so upset.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was still calm.</p>
「No writer is ever surprised by their own words.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Cheoldoo&#39;s shadow was cast on the spot where the others had retreated. The feet that had</p>
<p class="orv_line">been relentlessly trampling on the bug turned toward me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If it&#39;s decided, the rest of you get lost. I&#39;m only going to kill this asshole, as promised. Hey, get</p>
<p class="orv_line">out of my way.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">People at a short distance were beaten on the arms and legs with the pipe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aaaak! My arm!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#39;t be stupid, come over here quickly! Only one person needs to die!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The terrified people quickly ran to the scenario barrier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just like that, everyone was far away from my side.</p>
[There are 3 minutes remaining.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Only one person, the one person who hadn&#39;t run away, was still with me for this ending.</p>
