            <div class="orv_title"><h1>842 Episode 44 Evil Sophist (5)</h1>842 Episode 44 Evil Sophist (5)</div>
<p class="orv_line">The so-called &#x27;Supreme King Resurrection Plan&#x27; was steadily progressing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk and resurrection. If the first Kim Dokja, the Demon King of Salvation, had heard about it, then even he would have said that there was no such thing as a connection, but...</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The &#x27;King of Fear&#x27;, is watching the fault at that time.]</div>[The 'King of Fear', is watching the fault at that time.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seems that our second Kim Dokja likes this kind of story better.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It made sense. It is said that the second Kim Dokja likes sad and desolate stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just the setting that Yoo Joonghyuk was resurrected as a zombie by his worst enemy, Cheon Inho, and lived like a slave in a world that had already been destroyed would have made even the most desolate maniacs shed tears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know how much of a maniac the second was, but in any case, the operation went smoothly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheon Inho?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Preparations are complete.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein placed the &#x27;body&#x27; that Yoo Joonghyuk would use in the center of the empty lot. I looked down at Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s body in the drum and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But do I really have to work here? Isn&#x27;t there a safer place?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;re talking like you&#x27;re full again. You know it&#x27;s fortunate that we can use it here, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, we were currently inside the subway station &#x27;Geumho Station&#x27;. I wondered why it had to be &#x27;Geumho Station&#x27; out of all the places, but on the other hand, I also thought that this was a fate of its own.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Geumho Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The place where Cheon Inho became an &#x27;Instigator&#x27; and the place where I first possessed him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was ironic that the only safe place in the last scenario where the Korean Peninsula was destroyed was the station where the &#x27;first scenario&#x27; began.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you done recharging your skills?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, [Deceased Summoning] is my skill. I&#x27;m the one using it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, I was surprised when I looked at the incarnation body that I took out from the drum room.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait a minute. This incarnation body...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A body that was trained to fit the scenario. Muscles that are normally not overly swollen, but hide explosive power in between.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is only one incarnation that trains its body this effectively in the entire &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It’s Yoo Joonghyuk himself.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That’s right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It must have been destroyed, so how did you save it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;When [Preservation] was used in &lt;Olympus&gt;, the skill was applied to some parts of the incarnation body.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seems that the skill used to preserve Yoo Joonghyuk’s head was also applied to some parts of Yoo Joonghyuk’s body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were traces of the incarnation body being torn and patched up here and there. It seems that it wandered around the &lt;Star Stream&gt; with its major parts torn apart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I happened to know a story expert in the Demon Realm, so I asked them. Unfortunately, they also lost their life when they were attacked by the Blood Demon…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A story expert in the Demon Realm.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it might be Aileen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Etica’s store owner, the watchmaker Aileen. She died while mending someone&#x27;s story until the end of the 40th round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, are the materials ready to summon the perfect Yoo Joonghyuk with this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took a light breath and opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;[Deceased Summoning] takes at least 30 minutes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know. I&#x27;ve finished preparing in case.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Preparing in case?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before I could ask what that meant, I saw Lee Dansu stretching his body as he went out toward the passage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, a strange cry began to be heard as it opened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I became a little anxious and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What&#x27;s the situation?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Evil spirits will swarm.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Deceased Summoning is a technique that borrows dead souls and implants them into the body. And since you destroyed the underworld, there are spirits wandering around here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If a body capable of being possessed were to appear in the meantime, what do you think would happen among the evil spirits?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly broke out in a cold sweat. So now, the evil spirits were going to come in droves to take over this empty body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But don&#x27;t worry. We have Lee Dansu.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Eighth Evil Lee Dansu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I also knew about the Lee Dansu of the 40th round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was the vice-regent of the &#x27;Salvation Church&#x27; that followed Nirvana in this round, but he betrayed the Salvation Church and became a pseudo-exorcist after being hit by Cheon Inho&#x27;s &#x27;Incite Escalation&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansu, who was dancing roughly as if possessed by an animal, suddenly stuck a cane into the railroad tracks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The bamboo spear of the missionary.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wow, wait a minute. That&#x27;s the one I gave you as a gift. You have it here too?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I felt a strange sense of foreboding, a sacred aura burst out from the spear.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Character Lee Dansu activates &#x27;Absolute Divine Barrier Lv.???&#x27;!]</div>[Character Lee Dansu activates 'Absolute Divine Barrier Lv.???'!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Absolute Divine Barrier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was really surprised. A member of the Ten Evils was using the ultimate magic that only constellations of the absolute good lineage—at least the Archangel’s throne—could use.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo nodded meaningfully.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That’s the &#x27;Ghost Exterminator&#x27;—the Eighth Evil, Lee Dansu.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded in admiration.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#x27;Ten Evils&#x27; suddenly seemed amazing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the main story, they only appeared meaningfully, but they were all small villains, but here, they were really amazing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the [Absolute Divine Barrier] reached its limit and activated, the evil spirits that had been pouring in from outside began to scream and burn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe among the evil spirits burning there was Ms. Kim Anna, who had failed to possess them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tried hard to forget that fact.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Dansu approached me with sweat dripping from his forehead and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We can’t drag this on for too long. Get started quickly, Evil Sophist. The future of humanity depends on your decision.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded and cast [Deceased Summoning]. After a while, Yoo Joonghyuk’s head was stuck to Yoo Joonghyuk’s torso with a dazzling light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo, who was watching the scene from the side, muttered in a trembling voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;To witness the resurrection of that &#x27;Supreme King&#x27; in person.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Now I can even try out a scenario.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If Yoo Joonghyuk is here, there’s no problem.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled bitterly because the three of them seemed to be expecting too much.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don’t expect too much. Honestly, adding Yoo Joonghyuk won’t break the last scenario all at once.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you talking about? It’s that &#x27;Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;. The savior of the world, the strongest incarnation on earth. I can definitely expect it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Aren’t the Ten Evils praising the main character too much?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tried to make a pointless comment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Even so, it’s just a joke to me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The three of them looked at each other at the same time at my words. Then, a loud laughter filled Geumho Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked with a slightly strange feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why are you laughing?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Tsk tsk. If that&#x27;s a win, then it&#x27;s a win.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheon Inho definitely defeated Yoo Joonghyuk. I confirmed it in Anna&#x27;s [Past Sight]. But Ye Hyunwoo was acting as if I was bragging.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You really seem to have forgotten everything.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You set up curse traps everywhere Yoo Joonghyuk went, and you poisoned the food he ate without fail.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You installed [propaganda loudspeakers] everywhere and repeated the gaslighting in stages, and whenever you had the chance, you brought up the dead comrades of the tyrant to erode his mental power. For half a year.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued to listen to Ye Hyunwoo&#x27;s words with my mouth open.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;When he fought you, the tyrant was barely able to use about twenty percent of his maximum power. And you fought him in peak condition.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s what he was like?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then how did you defeat that tyrant?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was ridiculous.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That kind of secret happened in the 40th round&#x27;s battle I saw?</p>
<p class="orv_line">My shoulders, reflected on the broken screen door, looked so narrow that I couldn&#x27;t help but ask.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Am I weak?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo thought for a moment and then said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s a difficult question.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Be honest.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure any of us could win a one-on-one fight with you...&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Can you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sighed deeply, and Ye Hyunwoo added.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you didn&#x27;t prepare at all.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Prepare?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you prepare properly, none of us will be able to deal with you. When you&#x27;re ready, you&#x27;re stronger than any constellation in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;. You even defeated Poseidon.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Speaking of Poseidon, did I happen to catch him like I caught Yoo Joonghyuk?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;ve been infiltrating &lt;Olympus&gt; for a year to catch Poseidon.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t have the strength to be surprised anymore.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What on earth have you done to Poseidon in a year, Cheon Inho?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did you feed him dirt?</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was when the feeling of the dazzling light flowing out of Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;s body changed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Call the soul to use for the &#x27;Deceased Summoning Technique&#x27;.]</div>[Call the soul to use for the 'Deceased Summoning Technique'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The full-scale summoning was finally about to begin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth nervously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The incarnation I&#x27;m going to summon is the Demon King Yoo Joonghyuk.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The skill didn&#x27;t respond for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Please, please.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The spirit you summoned is nearby.]</div>[The spirit you summoned is nearby.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I almost cheered.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The spirit is suitable for the incarnation.]</div>[The spirit is suitable for the incarnation.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Deceased Summoning.]</div>[Deceased Summoning.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">There it is! As expected!</p>
<p class="orv_line">I held back tears that were about to well up and continued the summoning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo muttered while watching me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Honestly, I’m impressed.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don’t talk to me since this is an important part.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The tyrant will definitely kill you as soon as he wakes up.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hesitated for a moment and looked at Ye Hyunwoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was clear why Ye Hyunwoo was saying that. Right now, Ye Hyunwoo didn’t know that the target I was summoning was not the 40th round&#x27;s Yoo Joonghyuk, but the 41st round&#x27;s Yoo Joonghyuk’s soul.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And yet, you planned to summon the tyrant again in order to clear the last scenario. You’re probably the only incarnation in the world who can do that. So… I respect you a little.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You can do it a lot.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ll do it a little.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled bitterly, receiving the respect of the Ten Evils, but a new message appeared above my head.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[From now on, you can grant new characteristics to the summoned deceased&#x27;s body.]</div>[From now on, you can grant new characteristics to the summoned deceased's body.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Huh?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Please choose three characteristics to grant.]</div>[Please choose three characteristics to grant.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wait a minute. You can&#x27;t just summon it, but grant it three new characteristics?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「...So, when your mastery of the deceased summoning technique reaches the ultimate, you can &#x27;grant additional characteristics&#x27; to the summoned deceased.」</div>「...So, when your mastery of the deceased summoning technique reaches the ultimate, you can 'grant additional characteristics' to the summoned deceased.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve read about that before in &#x27;Ways of Survival&#x27;...</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wow, is this okay?</p>
<p class="orv_line">My heart suddenly raced.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk is already strong, but how much stronger will he be if he gains new characteristics as well?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The level of the incarnation is too high, so you cannot choose to grant attributes.]</div>[The level of the incarnation is too high, so you cannot choose to grant attributes.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, luck didn&#x27;t always go as I expected.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The incarnation randomly acquires three characteristics!]</div>[The incarnation randomly acquires three characteristics!]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The random roulette activates!]</div>[The random roulette activates!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn, is this random too?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It doesn&#x27;t matter. Since it&#x27;s a free trait anyway, I&#x27;ll be grateful if you give me anything.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The incarnation &#x27;Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;, has acquired a new trait!]</div>[The incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk', has acquired a new trait!]</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[The skull of the corresponding incarnation becomes very hard.]</div>[The skull of the corresponding incarnation becomes very hard.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Stone Head&quot;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheon Inho. What is that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I thought about it, it might not have been such a bad thing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wouldn&#x27;t be good for the already dangerous Yoo Joonghyuk to be smart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now there are two randomly granted traits left.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The roulette moves!]</div>[The roulette moves!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I prayed inwardly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Please. Demon King of Salvation. Great King of Fear. Demon-like Judge of Fire. Please help me. Depending on what trait Yoo Joonghyuk gains here, the last scenario could be pretty fun, or it could be hell.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By any chance, if he really gets a trait like [Life of Power]—</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation, &#x27;Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;, has gained a new trait!]</div>[Incarnation, 'Yoo Joonghyuk', has gained a new trait!]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive trait, &#x27;Eating Bias&#x27;, is gained!]</div>[Exclusive trait, 'Eating Bias', is gained!]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The incarnation can only eat &#x27;one&#x27; type of food.]</div>[The incarnation can only eat 'one' type of food.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Eating Bias. It was a trait that was neither good nor bad.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A trait where the incarnation&#x27;s abilities would decrease significantly if he ate food other than the designated food.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it was fortunate. After all, that bastard Yoo Joonghyuk only eats things he makes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Please, if only the last trait would come out well…</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation, &#x27;Yoo Joonghyuk&#x27;, has gained a new trait!]</div>[Incarnation, 'Yoo Joonghyuk', has gained a new trait!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">And after a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I rubbed my eyes and thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wait a minute.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this really what came out?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at the trait name quietly. And thought.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive trait, &#x27;Uncookable&#x27;, is gained!]</div>[Exclusive trait, 'Uncookable', is gained!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Oh my god.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This incarnation can&#x27;t cook.]</div>[This incarnation can't cook.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was the moment when Yoo Joonghyuk, who was the first version unable to cook throughout Ways of Survival, was born.</p>
