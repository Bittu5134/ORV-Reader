        <article class="orv_main">
            <div class="orv_title"><h1>653 Episode 19 People of the Past (5)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Finally got a new attribute.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Acquisition of a legendary Attribute!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was even a legendary attribute.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I muttered 'attribute window' in my mind, and almost simultaneously.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Attribute window cannot be activated due to current system error.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It reminded me of the fact that I, like Kim Dokja, have limited access to my system window.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Acquired the attribute 'Record Repairer'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But fortunately, this time the name of the acquired attribute immediately came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Record repaired'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a feature I had never seen before.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The attribute 'Record Repairer' is activated!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Record Repairer' is affected by the losses you have acquired'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Record Repairer' begins mending your lost records.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Mend my missing records?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[1 hour and 30 minutes to complete record repair.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know what it means, but after an hour and thirty minutes, something will change.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Someone noticed that a new record-repairer was born.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Recorders of Fear' have recognized your existence.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then came a suspicious message.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As far as I know, a 'Recorder of Fear' is a writer who left a record of the divinity of the other world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was their common name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But did they recognize me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Could it be that the 'Recorders of Fear' can also see incarnations like the constellations?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some 'Recorders of Fear' consider your existence a threat.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Am I a threat?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The information available at this time was too limited.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All I can know now is that the people of Geumho Station who died in the third round survived here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi! Were you alive?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Keuheuk! Brother!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung, whose golden eyes disappeared before I knew it, asked me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are these people you know?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded lightly</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, Bang Cheolsoo, this bastard, has been grossly attached to me for too long.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I lightly smacked the back of the head of the water-proof man who had buried his head in my arm.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Lord of Mischief' sponsored 100 coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It's still there.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Have there been many things accumulated in the past? Bang Cheolsoo grabbed me and talked about what had been going on all along.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"So suddenly the tunnel collapsed and my brother couldn't go to Chungmuro, Gaesin. Ugh, I thought I was really dying at that time-"</p>
<p class="orv_line">From tunnel collapse accidents to sudden scenario changes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I listened roughly, it sounded painful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because it's a round with so many variables. It was only a matter of luck that they survived.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I listened to Bang Cheolsoo's story and observed the people of Geumho Station looking this way from a distance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first thing that caught my eye was Dayoung and her daughter, who were called Moojung mother-daughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dayoung's mother. In the third round, she struggles to save her daughter, but in the end she is the one who became the nutrient of  Paradise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What is your overall ability level?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't tell me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You look lower than me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dayoung and Shin Yoosoung were talking about their skills.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked back at Bang Cheolsoo, who was still talking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Brother, that’s why I sent them to-"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Lord of Mischief' wants you to hang out with his incarnation again.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I said, looking at the flag affixed to his waist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Bang Cheolsoo."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You've become a king."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo, who opened his mouth slightly, scratched the back of his head and laughed shyly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Whoa, I'll give you the flag if you want. I had it for you anyway."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at the flag Bang Cheolsoo had outstretched.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was lighter in color than mine, but it was a purple flag.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I have that flag, I will achieve 'Black Flag' right away, then I can complete the 'King's Road' scenario and formally receive the 'King''s traits.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, that was the easy way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's yours."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't like it.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' asks why you don't accept it.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' nods to your judgment.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' admires your camaraderie.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[500 coins were sponsored.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know why, but I didn't want to take that flag.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It might be because Dayoung, who is looking at Bang Cheolsoo from a distance with her mother, and other people's eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it's a selfish wish as a writer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The desire to see Bang Cheolsoo and the people's stories a little longer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Bro."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo's eyes widened.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Lord of Mischief' is impressed by your spirit.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[300 coins were sponsored.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I said with a quick wave of my hand before the atmosphere got more serious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Rather than that, I'd like to hear something about the dungeon."</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Thirty minutes after that, I stood at the entrance to the dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Do you want to enter the [Labyrinth]?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was different from the dungeon in the main story, starting with the entry notification sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If we go in here, there must be a star jewel, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo nodded his head at my question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, sure. I also saw those who collected star jewels."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"They must be the 7 kings of Seoul."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, how did you know?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was obvious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in the main story, only the 7 kings of Seoul were able to obtain the 'star jewels' here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No matter how strong my bro is, if you run into the 7 kings, you should avoid them. They really aren't normal guys."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I guess so. Anyway, because they’re kings."</p>
<p class="orv_line">This  turn is the 41st, not the 3rd. It was seldom possible to know how high the level of the 7 kings would have been.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, I can't back down from here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Whether it's the 7 kings or the Misreading association, if I can collect 'star jewels', then I should go in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because the star jewel is an essential material for summoning the 'Sword of Death'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Brother, can’t you really wait? In three hours, we can go back in."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Three hours is too long. See you later."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, in this dungeon, once you exit, there is a waiting time for re-entry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It would be nice to wait for the group at Geumho Station and enter together, but now was not the time to do that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to my thoughts, it is because the readers and Dansu ahjussi are definitely in that dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm ready, ahjussi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">And fortunately. I wasn't even going alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you really okay?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. I'll go too."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung said that and looked back at Dayoung, who was about ten steps away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw Dayoung, who had opened her eyes, slashing her hand menacingly towards me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Dayoung, you can’t do that."</p>
<p class="orv_line">When Dayoung's mother opened her mouth in a tone of admonition, Dayoung licked her lips. Shin Yoosoung looked at Dayoung and continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You have to become stronger, so you won’t be afraid even if you meet scary adults."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder if she was stimulated by seeing a child her age. There was a certain determination in Shin Yoosoung's voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a determination that somehow made me a little sad.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There are also ways to meet good adults."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Good adults die quickly."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I was listening to those words that gave me a strange sense of déjà vu, a headache arose again deep inside my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I advised, rubbing my temples lightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If it seems dangerous, we will escape immediately. You know?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It hurts my heart, but it was also true that Shin Yoosoung's help was essential to clear the final chapter of the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was Kim Dokja always with Shin Yoosoung in this mood?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Please be careful, brother!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Leaving behind the group of Geumho Station, who bowed their heads in unison, I entered the labyrinth with Shin Yooyoung.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have entered the 'Star Labyrinth'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as I opened the door and entered, what I saw was a dark hallway reminiscent of a dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, there seemed to be no 'new hunter' like before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just in case, I continued to be vigilant and looked around, but a series of system messages flew in.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new sub-scenario has arrived!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Sub Scenario - Star Labyrinth&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Sub</p>
<p>Difficulty: A++</p>
<p>Clear Condition: Explore the Star Labyrinth and acquire the hidden 'Star Jewel'</p>
<p>Time limit: —</p>
<p>Reward: 3,000 Coins</p>
<p>Failure: There is no failure penalty for this scenario.</p>
<p>* There are special rules for this scenario.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">It's a star labyrinth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I checked the 'Special Rules' that followed.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>1. The Labyrinth Keeper appears in the Labyrinth.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Keeper?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Are there even minotaurs?</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>2. The labyrinth is relocated every 3 hours, and when relocated, the entire labyrinth is engulfed in flames and the internal structure is changed.</p>
<p>3. You can avoid the flames by entering the nearby 'Safe Area' when 'relocating'. You can choose to escape the labyrinth when entering the 'Safe Area'.</p>
<p>Then, a timer appeared in front of my eyes.</p>
<p><!>[1 hour and 54 minutes left until relocation.]</p>
<p><!>[Look for a 'Safe Area'.]</p>
<p>Although this was tricky, the pattern itself wasn't difficult.</p>
<p>You can survive if you somehow find a 'safe area' within the time limit.</p>
<p>The question is, how many more of these rules are there?</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">4. 'Dust Man' is provided to all incarnations who have entered the Labyrinth.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>Then a small lump of dust appeared in the air above my head.</p>
<p>The lump of dust with small eyes looked around, then opened its small mouth and made a sound.</p>
<p>ㅡByeolbyeol</p>
<p>As it was, it circled over my head and started to devour the shiny pieces of gold that were scattered on the floor.</p>
<p><!>[Your 'Dust Man' has acquired 1 Star Powder.]</p>
<p>Only then did I feel like I was getting a little bit of a sense of what the rules of this dungeon were.</p>
<p>"Wow, ahjussi! Look at this!"</p>
<p>Before I knew it, a small dust man had been created beside Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p>The dustman, who was circling around us with a 'byeolbyeol' sound, greedily opened his mouth whenever he saw gold dust glittering on the floor.</p>
<p><!>[Your 'Dust Man' has acquired 1 star dust!]</p>
<p>Seeing the scene, Shin Yoosoung opened her mouth.</p>
<p>"I know what this is."</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">5. 'Dust Man' creates star jewels when acquiring a certain amount of 'star dust'.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>Rules revealed as if they had been waiting.</p>
<p>As expected, the goal of this dungeon was to raise the 'Dust Man' and obtain the Star Jewels.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">6. 'Dustmen' in the same group can be combined through [Fusion].</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>Shin Yoosoung asked.</p>
<p>"Shall we put it together?"</p>
<p>"Great."</p>
<p>After all, we're in the same group.</p>
<p>There was no need to waste efficiency by raising several Dustmen.</p>
<p>When I selected [Fusion], my dust man opened his mouth wide and ate up Shin Yoosoung's dust man.</p>
<p><!>[Incarnation Shin Yoosoung’s 'Dust Man' has been absorbed.]</p>
<p><!>[The 'Dust Man' of the Seoul Station Group is growing.]</p>
<p>Is it because they are combined? The speed at which he collected star dust was much faster than before.</p>
<p>"It keeps moving."</p>
<p>We continued to explore the labyrinth, calmly maintaining the boundaries of the sandbar.</p>
<p>Traces of a gruesome battle remained at every corner of the road.</p>
<p>The corpses stabbed and cut each other without hesitation, clinging to each other like stains.</p>
<p>Near the corpses, the star dust they had acquired during their lifetimes fell sparsely.</p>
<p><!>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' says it's going to be fun now.]</p>
<p><!>[Some constellations are looking forward to your performance]</p>
<p>We picked up the star dust silently, as if we were collecting remains.</p>
<p>Why did these people have to come to this place and die?</p>
<p>Most of these people probably don't even know what the 'death sword' is.</p>
<p><!>[A small number of constellations hold their tongues.]</p>
<p>No, maybe I know why they died. They died to be a story.</p>
<p>"As expected, good adults die quickly."</p>
<p>When I looked around, Shin Yoosoung was staring down at the dead woman's face.</p>
<p>I also stopped beside Shin Yoosoung and looked down at the dead woman.</p>
<p>An unfamiliar face.</p>
<p>I don't know who this person is.</p>
<p>I probably won't know in the future.</p>
<p>But Shin Yoosoung seemed to know.</p>
<p>"Do you know this person?"</p>
<p>"She's the one who stopped me when I tried to enter the single-person dungeon."</p>
<p>I put my hand on the shoulder of Shin Yoosoung, who was standing blankly.</p>
<p>"Shin Yoosoung."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Are you okay?"</p>
<p>After hesitating for a while, Shin Yoosoung nodded her head.</p>
<p>I couldn't read the child's expression, so I couldn't tell if she was okay or not. But at that moment, Shin Yoosoung's retina looked strangely deep.</p>
<p>"People always died even before the scenario."</p>
<p>"That's true."</p>
<p>"It just didn't happen right in front of me."</p>
<p>I didn't expect to hear such a story, so I was a little surprised.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung quickly shook her head.</p>
<p>"Sorry. I said something too cheeky. Sometimes I say strange things without even realizing it."</p>
<p>"No. I also agree with you. Death has always existed. It's just that it wasn't so explicit."</p>
<p>People died even before the scenarios started.</p>
<p>Men killed men.</p>
<p>They killed each other and talked about each other's death. It's a world where it's okay to talk like that.</p>
<p>"Are you all right?"</p>
<p>"I’m fine."</p>
<p>Since it was a world where all gods could exist as 'constellations', there was nothing strange about killing people.</p>
<p>However, in a world like that, I rather didn't want to believe in anything.</p>
<p>"Do people have souls?"</p>
<p>"They do."</p>
<p>Was it because I answered too confidently? Shin Yoosoung asked with her eyes wide open.</p>
<p>"Then where will the dead Younghoon go?"</p>
<p>"She will go to the underworld."</p>
<p>"Are there scenarios there?"</p>
<p>"There might be."</p>
<p>"Then, even if I die, it won't be any different from here."</p>
<p>"In a sense."</p>
<p>Then Shin Yoosoung looked up at me.</p>
<p>"Still, ahjussi, don't die."</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"Shin Yoosoung as well."</p>
<p>We prayed for the woman's rest in silence. The ashes scattered on the floor looked like the scattered soul of a woman.</p>
<p><!>[Dust Man's 'star dust' has exceeded 100!]</p>
<p><!>[Only in the Star Labyrinth, your physical strength will increase by 1.]</p>
<p>Even in the midst of that, we were getting stronger at the cost of surviving.</p>
<p>I ran into other incarnations several times, but as soon as they saw my 'Blade of Faith', they got scared and ran away.</p>
<p>Somehow, it was a day when I didn't want to kill anyone, so I thought it was fortunate in my heart.</p>
<p><!>[Star dust obtained so far: 302]</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung said while looking at the star dust that had already exceeded 300.</p>
<p>"Ahjussi, if it's like this-"</p>
<p>"Don't say it will go smoothly."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>It was then that the empty Dustman stopped.</p>
<p>-Star?</p>
<p><!>[Currently, there is almost no 'star dust' remaining in the 'Star Labyrinth'.]</p>
<p>Damn, then it is.</p>
<p>There's no way the 'scenario I knew' would go so smoothly.</p>
<p><!>[Hunt other incarnations to obtain 'star dust'.]</p>
<p>After all, this labyrinth is a stage created to induce the incarnations to fight.</p>
<p>How many incarnations must I hunt to collect seven star jewels?</p>
<p>I didn't want to guess.</p>
<p>It was then that the additional rules came to mind.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">7. Incarnations that have acquired 'Star Jewels' will have their overall stats rise dramatically.</p>
<p class="orv_line">8. Every time you acquire 1 'Star Jewel', the 'Madness' level increases.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>…Madness?</p>
<p>ㅡStar!</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Dust Man above my head started shaking like crazy.</p>
<p>The reason was immediately clear.</p>
<p><!>[There is an incarnation with a star jewel nearby.]</p>
<p>"Ahjussi."</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>A slight vibration was felt on the floor.</p>
<p>Something was coming this way.</p>
<p>"There is one of the 'Seven Kings of Seoul' around here."</p>
<p></p>
