        <article class="orv_main">
            <div class="orv_title"><h1>653 Episode 19 People of the Past (5)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Finally got a new attribute.</p>
[Acquisition of a legendary Attribute!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was even a legendary attribute.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I muttered &#39;attribute window&#39; in my mind, and almost simultaneously.</p>
[Attribute window cannot be activated due to current system error.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It reminded me of the fact that I, like Kim Dokja, have limited access to my system window.</p>
[Acquired the attribute &#39;Record Repairer&#39;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But fortunately, this time the name of the acquired attribute immediately came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Record repaired&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a feature I had never seen before.</p>
[The attribute &#39;Record Repairer&#39; is activated!]</p></div>
[&#39;Record Repairer&#39; is affected by the losses you have acquired&#39;.]</p></div>
[The &#39;Record Repairer&#39; begins mending your lost records.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Mend my missing records?</p>
[1 hour and 30 minutes to complete record repair.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know what it means, but after an hour and thirty minutes, something will change.</p>
[Someone noticed that a new record-repairer was born.]</p></div>
[The &#39;Recorders of Fear&#39; have recognized your existence.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then came a suspicious message.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As far as I know, a &#39;Recorder of Fear&#39; is a writer who left a record of the divinity of the other world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was their common name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But did they recognize me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Could it be that the &#39;Recorders of Fear&#39; can also see incarnations like the constellations?</p>
[Some &#39;Recorders of Fear&#39; consider your existence a threat.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Am I a threat?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The information available at this time was too limited.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All I can know now is that the people of Geumho Station who died in the third round survived here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi! Were you alive?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Keuheuk! Brother!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung, whose golden eyes disappeared before I knew it, asked me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are these people you know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded lightly</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, Bang Cheolsoo, this bastard, has been grossly attached to me for too long.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I lightly smacked the back of the head of the water-proof man who had buried his head in my arm.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Lord of Mischief&#39; sponsored 100 coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s still there.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Have there been many things accumulated in the past? Bang Cheolsoo grabbed me and talked about what had been going on all along.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So suddenly the tunnel collapsed and my brother couldn&#39;t go to Chungmuro, Gaesin. Ugh, I thought I was really dying at that time-&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">From tunnel collapse accidents to sudden scenario changes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I listened roughly, it sounded painful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because it&#39;s a round with so many variables. It was only a matter of luck that they survived.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I listened to Bang Cheolsoo&#39;s story and observed the people of Geumho Station looking this way from a distance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first thing that caught my eye was Dayoung and her daughter, who were called Moojung mother-daughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dayoung&#39;s mother. In the third round, she struggles to save her daughter, but in the end she is the one who became the nutrient of  Paradise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What is your overall ability level?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#39;t tell me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You look lower than me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dayoung and Shin Yoosoung were talking about their skills.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked back at Bang Cheolsoo, who was still talking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Brother, that’s why I sent them to-&quot;</p>
[The constellation &#39;Lord of Mischief&#39; wants you to hang out with his incarnation again.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I said, looking at the flag affixed to his waist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Bang Cheolsoo.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#39;ve become a king.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo, who opened his mouth slightly, scratched the back of his head and laughed shyly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Whoa, I&#39;ll give you the flag if you want. I had it for you anyway.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at the flag Bang Cheolsoo had outstretched.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was lighter in color than mine, but it was a purple flag.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I have that flag, I will achieve &#39;Black Flag&#39; right away, then I can complete the &#39;King&#39;s Road&#39; scenario and formally receive the &#39;King&#39;&#39;s traits.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, that was the easy way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s yours.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t like it.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Abyssal Black Flame Dragon&#39; asks why you don&#39;t accept it.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Demon-like Judge of Fire&#39; nods to your judgment.]</p></div>
[The constellation &#39;Maritime War God&#39; admires your camaraderie.]</p></div>
[500 coins were sponsored.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know why, but I didn&#39;t want to take that flag.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It might be because Dayoung, who is looking at Bang Cheolsoo from a distance with her mother, and other people&#39;s eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it&#39;s a selfish wish as a writer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The desire to see Bang Cheolsoo and the people&#39;s stories a little longer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Bro.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo&#39;s eyes widened.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Lord of Mischief&#39; is impressed by your spirit.]</p></div>
[300 coins were sponsored.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I said with a quick wave of my hand before the atmosphere got more serious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Rather than that, I&#39;d like to hear something about the dungeon.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Thirty minutes after that, I stood at the entrance to the dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Do you want to enter the [Labyrinth]?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was different from the dungeon in the main story, starting with the entry notification sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If we go in here, there must be a star jewel, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo nodded his head at my question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, sure. I also saw those who collected star jewels.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They must be the 7 kings of Seoul.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, how did you know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was obvious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in the main story, only the 7 kings of Seoul were able to obtain the &#39;star jewels&#39; here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No matter how strong my bro is, if you run into the 7 kings, you should avoid them. They really aren&#39;t normal guys.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I guess so. Anyway, because they’re kings.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This  turn is the 41st, not the 3rd. It was seldom possible to know how high the level of the 7 kings would have been.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, I can&#39;t back down from here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Whether it&#39;s the 7 kings or the Misreading association, if I can collect &#39;star jewels&#39;, then I should go in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because the star jewel is an essential material for summoning the &#39;Sword of Death&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Brother, can’t you really wait? In three hours, we can go back in.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Three hours is too long. See you later.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, in this dungeon, once you exit, there is a waiting time for re-entry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It would be nice to wait for the group at Geumho Station and enter together, but now was not the time to do that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to my thoughts, it is because the readers and Dansu ahjussi are definitely in that dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;m ready, ahjussi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">And fortunately. I wasn&#39;t even going alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you really okay?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. I&#39;ll go too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung said that and looked back at Dayoung, who was about ten steps away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw Dayoung, who had opened her eyes, slashing her hand menacingly towards me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Dayoung, you can’t do that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When Dayoung&#39;s mother opened her mouth in a tone of admonition, Dayoung licked her lips. Shin Yoosoung looked at Dayoung and continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You have to become stronger, so you won’t be afraid even if you meet scary adults.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder if she was stimulated by seeing a child her age. There was a certain determination in Shin Yoosoung&#39;s voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a determination that somehow made me a little sad.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There are also ways to meet good adults.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Good adults die quickly.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I was listening to those words that gave me a strange sense of déjà vu, a headache arose again deep inside my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I advised, rubbing my temples lightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If it seems dangerous, we will escape immediately. You know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It hurts my heart, but it was also true that Shin Yoosoung&#39;s help was essential to clear the final chapter of the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was Kim Dokja always with Shin Yoosoung in this mood?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Please be careful, brother!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Leaving behind the group of Geumho Station, who bowed their heads in unison, I entered the labyrinth with Shin Yooyoung.</p>
[You have entered the &#39;Star Labyrinth&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as I opened the door and entered, what I saw was a dark hallway reminiscent of a dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, there seemed to be no &#39;new hunter&#39; like before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just in case, I continued to be vigilant and looked around, but a series of system messages flew in.</p>
[A new sub-scenario has arrived!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Sub Scenario - Star Labyrinth&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Sub</p>
<p>Difficulty: A++</p>
<p>Clear Condition: Explore the Star Labyrinth and acquire the hidden &#39;Star Jewel&#39;</p>
<p>Time limit: —</p>
<p>Reward: 3,000 Coins</p>
<p>Failure: There is no failure penalty for this scenario.</p>
<p>* There are special rules for this scenario.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">It&#39;s a star labyrinth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I checked the &#39;Special Rules&#39; that followed.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>1. The Labyrinth Keeper appears in the Labyrinth.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Keeper?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Are there even minotaurs?</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>2. The labyrinth is relocated every 3 hours, and when relocated, the entire labyrinth is engulfed in flames and the internal structure is changed.</p>
<p>3. You can avoid the flames by entering the nearby &#39;Safe Area&#39; when &#39;relocating&#39;. You can choose to escape the labyrinth when entering the &#39;Safe Area&#39;.</p>
<p>Then, a timer appeared in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[1 hour and 54 minutes left until relocation.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Look for a &#39;Safe Area&#39;.]</p>
<p>Although this was tricky, the pattern itself wasn&#39;t difficult.</p>
<p>You can survive if you somehow find a &#39;safe area&#39; within the time limit.</p>
<p>The question is, how many more of these rules are there?</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">4. &#39;Dust Man&#39; is provided to all incarnations who have entered the Labyrinth.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>Then a small lump of dust appeared in the air above my head.</p>
<p>The lump of dust with small eyes looked around, then opened its small mouth and made a sound.</p>
<p>ㅡByeolbyeol</p>
<p>As it was, it circled over my head and started to devour the shiny pieces of gold that were scattered on the floor.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Your &#39;Dust Man&#39; has acquired 1 Star Powder.]</p>
<p>Only then did I feel like I was getting a little bit of a sense of what the rules of this dungeon were.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, ahjussi! Look at this!&quot;</p>
<p>Before I knew it, a small dust man had been created beside Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p>The dustman, who was circling around us with a &#39;byeolbyeol&#39; sound, greedily opened his mouth whenever he saw gold dust glittering on the floor.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Your &#39;Dust Man&#39; has acquired 1 star dust!]</p>
<p>Seeing the scene, Shin Yoosoung opened her mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;I know what this is.&quot;</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">5. &#39;Dust Man&#39; creates star jewels when acquiring a certain amount of &#39;star dust&#39;.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>Rules revealed as if they had been waiting.</p>
<p>As expected, the goal of this dungeon was to raise the &#39;Dust Man&#39; and obtain the Star Jewels.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">6. &#39;Dustmen&#39; in the same group can be combined through [Fusion].</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>Shin Yoosoung asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Shall we put it together?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Great.&quot;</p>
<p>After all, we&#39;re in the same group.</p>
<p>There was no need to waste efficiency by raising several Dustmen.</p>
<p>When I selected [Fusion], my dust man opened his mouth wide and ate up Shin Yoosoung&#39;s dust man.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Incarnation Shin Yoosoung’s &#39;Dust Man&#39; has been absorbed.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The &#39;Dust Man&#39; of the Seoul Station Group is growing.]</p>
<p>Is it because they are combined? The speed at which he collected star dust was much faster than before.</p>
<p>&quot;It keeps moving.&quot;</p>
<p>We continued to explore the labyrinth, calmly maintaining the boundaries of the sandbar.</p>
<p>Traces of a gruesome battle remained at every corner of the road.</p>
<p>The corpses stabbed and cut each other without hesitation, clinging to each other like stains.</p>
<p>Near the corpses, the star dust they had acquired during their lifetimes fell sparsely.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Abyssal Black Flame Dragon&#39; says it&#39;s going to be fun now.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Some constellations are looking forward to your performance]</p>
<p>We picked up the star dust silently, as if we were collecting remains.</p>
<p>Why did these people have to come to this place and die?</p>
<p>Most of these people probably don&#39;t even know what the &#39;death sword&#39; is.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[A small number of constellations hold their tongues.]</p>
<p>No, maybe I know why they died. They died to be a story.</p>
<p>&quot;As expected, good adults die quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>When I looked around, Shin Yoosoung was staring down at the dead woman&#39;s face.</p>
<p>I also stopped beside Shin Yoosoung and looked down at the dead woman.</p>
<p>An unfamiliar face.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know who this person is.</p>
<p>I probably won&#39;t know in the future.</p>
<p>But Shin Yoosoung seemed to know.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know this person?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She&#39;s the one who stopped me when I tried to enter the single-person dungeon.&quot;</p>
<p>I put my hand on the shoulder of Shin Yoosoung, who was standing blankly.</p>
<p>&quot;Shin Yoosoung.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot;</p>
<p>After hesitating for a while, Shin Yoosoung nodded her head.</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t read the child&#39;s expression, so I couldn&#39;t tell if she was okay or not. But at that moment, Shin Yoosoung&#39;s retina looked strangely deep.</p>
<p>&quot;People always died even before the scenario.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s true.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It just didn&#39;t happen right in front of me.&quot;</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t expect to hear such a story, so I was a little surprised.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung quickly shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry. I said something too cheeky. Sometimes I say strange things without even realizing it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. I also agree with you. Death has always existed. It&#39;s just that it wasn&#39;t so explicit.&quot;</p>
<p>People died even before the scenarios started.</p>
<p>Men killed men.</p>
<p>They killed each other and talked about each other&#39;s death. It&#39;s a world where it&#39;s okay to talk like that.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you all right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I’m fine.&quot;</p>
<p>Since it was a world where all gods could exist as &#39;constellations&#39;, there was nothing strange about killing people.</p>
<p>However, in a world like that, I rather didn&#39;t want to believe in anything.</p>
<p>&quot;Do people have souls?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They do.&quot;</p>
<p>Was it because I answered too confidently? Shin Yoosoung asked with her eyes wide open.</p>
<p>&quot;Then where will the dead Younghoon go?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She will go to the underworld.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are there scenarios there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There might be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then, even if I die, it won&#39;t be any different from here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In a sense.&quot;</p>
<p>Then Shin Yoosoung looked up at me.</p>
<p>&quot;Still, ahjussi, don&#39;t die.&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Shin Yoosoung as well.&quot;</p>
<p>We prayed for the woman&#39;s rest in silence. The ashes scattered on the floor looked like the scattered soul of a woman.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Dust Man&#39;s &#39;star dust&#39; has exceeded 100!]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Only in the Star Labyrinth, your physical strength will increase by 1.]</p>
<p>Even in the midst of that, we were getting stronger at the cost of surviving.</p>
<p>I ran into other incarnations several times, but as soon as they saw my &#39;Blade of Faith&#39;, they got scared and ran away.</p>
<p>Somehow, it was a day when I didn&#39;t want to kill anyone, so I thought it was fortunate in my heart.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Star dust obtained so far: 302]</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung said while looking at the star dust that had already exceeded 300.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahjussi, if it&#39;s like this-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#39;t say it will go smoothly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p>It was then that the empty Dustman stopped.</p>
<p>-Star?</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Currently, there is almost no &#39;star dust&#39; remaining in the &#39;Star Labyrinth&#39;.]</p>
<p>Damn, then it is.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no way the &#39;scenario I knew&#39; would go so smoothly.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Hunt other incarnations to obtain &#39;star dust&#39;.]</p>
<p>After all, this labyrinth is a stage created to induce the incarnations to fight.</p>
<p>How many incarnations must I hunt to collect seven star jewels?</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t want to guess.</p>
<p>It was then that the additional rules came to mind.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">7. Incarnations that have acquired &#39;Star Jewels&#39; will have their overall stats rise dramatically.</p>
<p class="orv_line">8. Every time you acquire 1 &#39;Star Jewel&#39;, the &#39;Madness&#39; level increases.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>…Madness?</p>
<p>ㅡStar!</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Dust Man above my head started shaking like crazy.</p>
<p>The reason was immediately clear.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[There is an incarnation with a star jewel nearby.]</p>
<p>&quot;Ahjussi.&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>A slight vibration was felt on the floor.</p>
<p>Something was coming this way.</p>
<p>&quot;There is one of the &#39;Seven Kings of Seoul&#39; around here.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
