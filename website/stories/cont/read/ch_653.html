<p class="orv_line">It was even a legendary attribute.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I muttered &#x27;attribute window&#x27; in my mind, and almost simultaneously.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Attribute window cannot be activated due to current system error.]</div>[Attribute window cannot be activated due to current system error.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know what it means, but after an hour and thirty minutes, something will change.</p>

<div class="orv_system"><p>[The &#x27;Recorders of Fear&#x27; have recognized your existence.]</div>[The 'Recorders of Fear' have recognized your existence.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then came a suspicious message.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As far as I know, a &#x27;Recorder of Fear&#x27; is a writer who left a record of the divinity of the other world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was their common name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But did they recognize me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Could it be that the &#x27;Recorders of Fear&#x27; can also see incarnations like the constellations?</p>

<p class="orv_line">Am I a threat?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The information available at this time was too limited.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All I can know now is that the people of Geumho Station who died in the third round survived here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi! Were you alive?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Keuheuk! Brother!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung, whose golden eyes disappeared before I knew it, asked me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are these people you know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded lightly</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, Bang Cheolsoo, this bastard, has been grossly attached to me for too long.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I lightly smacked the back of the head of the water-proof man who had buried his head in my arm.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Lord of Mischief&#x27; sponsored 100 coins.]</div>[The constellation 'Lord of Mischief' sponsored 100 coins.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s still there.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Have there been many things accumulated in the past? Bang Cheolsoo grabbed me and talked about what had been going on all along.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So suddenly the tunnel collapsed and my brother couldn&#x27;t go to Chungmuro, Gaesin. Ugh, I thought I was really dying at that time-&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">From tunnel collapse accidents to sudden scenario changes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I listened roughly, it sounded painful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because it&#x27;s a round with so many variables. It was only a matter of luck that they survived.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I listened to Bang Cheolsoo&#x27;s story and observed the people of Geumho Station looking this way from a distance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first thing that caught my eye was Dayoung and her daughter, who were called Moojung mother-daughter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dayoung&#x27;s mother. In the third round, she struggles to save her daughter, but in the end she is the one who became the nutrient of  Paradise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What is your overall ability level?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#x27;t tell me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You look lower than me.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dayoung and Shin Yoosoung were talking about their skills.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked back at Bang Cheolsoo, who was still talking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Brother, that’s why I sent them to-&quot;</p>

<p class="orv_line">I said, looking at the flag affixed to his waist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Bang Cheolsoo.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;ve become a king.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo, who opened his mouth slightly, scratched the back of his head and laughed shyly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Whoa, I&#x27;ll give you the flag if you want. I had it for you anyway.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at the flag Bang Cheolsoo had outstretched.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was lighter in color than mine, but it was a purple flag.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I have that flag, I will achieve &#x27;Black Flag&#x27; right away, then I can complete the &#x27;King&#x27;s Road&#x27; scenario and formally receive the &#x27;King&#x27;&#x27;s traits.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, that was the easy way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s yours.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t like it.</p>

<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know why, but I didn&#x27;t want to take that flag.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It might be because Dayoung, who is looking at Bang Cheolsoo from a distance with her mother, and other people&#x27;s eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it&#x27;s a selfish wish as a writer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The desire to see Bang Cheolsoo and the people&#x27;s stories a little longer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Bro.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo&#x27;s eyes widened.</p>

<p class="orv_line">I said with a quick wave of my hand before the atmosphere got more serious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Rather than that, I&#x27;d like to hear something about the dungeon.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">Thirty minutes after that, I stood at the entrance to the dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Do you want to enter the [Labyrinth]?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was different from the dungeon in the main story, starting with the entry notification sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If we go in here, there must be a star jewel, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang Cheolsoo nodded his head at my question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, sure. I also saw those who collected star jewels.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They must be the 7 kings of Seoul.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, how did you know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was obvious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in the main story, only the 7 kings of Seoul were able to obtain the &#x27;star jewels&#x27; here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No matter how strong my bro is, if you run into the 7 kings, you should avoid them. They really aren&#x27;t normal guys.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I guess so. Anyway, because they’re kings.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This  turn is the 41st, not the 3rd. It was seldom possible to know how high the level of the 7 kings would have been.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, I can&#x27;t back down from here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Whether it&#x27;s the 7 kings or the Misreading association, if I can collect &#x27;star jewels&#x27;, then I should go in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is because the star jewel is an essential material for summoning the &#x27;Sword of Death&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Brother, can’t you really wait? In three hours, we can go back in.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Three hours is too long. See you later.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, in this dungeon, once you exit, there is a waiting time for re-entry.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It would be nice to wait for the group at Geumho Station and enter together, but now was not the time to do that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to my thoughts, it is because the readers and Dansu ahjussi are definitely in that dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m ready, ahjussi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">And fortunately. I wasn&#x27;t even going alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you really okay?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. I&#x27;ll go too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosoung said that and looked back at Dayoung, who was about ten steps away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw Dayoung, who had opened her eyes, slashing her hand menacingly towards me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Dayoung, you can’t do that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When Dayoung&#x27;s mother opened her mouth in a tone of admonition, Dayoung licked her lips. Shin Yoosoung looked at Dayoung and continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You have to become stronger, so you won’t be afraid even if you meet scary adults.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder if she was stimulated by seeing a child her age. There was a certain determination in Shin Yoosoung&#x27;s voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a determination that somehow made me a little sad.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There are also ways to meet good adults.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Good adults die quickly.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I was listening to those words that gave me a strange sense of déjà vu, a headache arose again deep inside my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I advised, rubbing my temples lightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If it seems dangerous, we will escape immediately. You know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It hurts my heart, but it was also true that Shin Yoosoung&#x27;s help was essential to clear the final chapter of the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was Kim Dokja always with Shin Yoosoung in this mood?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Please be careful, brother!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Leaving behind the group of Geumho Station, who bowed their heads in unison, I entered the labyrinth with Shin Yooyoung.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have entered the &#x27;Star Labyrinth&#x27;.]</div>[You have entered the 'Star Labyrinth'.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as I opened the door and entered, what I saw was a dark hallway reminiscent of a dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, there seemed to be no &#x27;new hunter&#x27; like before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just in case, I continued to be vigilant and looked around, but a series of system messages flew in.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new sub-scenario has arrived!]</div>[A new sub-scenario has arrived!]</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Sub Scenario - Star Labyrinth&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Sub</p>
<p>Difficulty: A++</p>
<p>Clear Condition: Explore the Star Labyrinth and acquire the hidden &#x27;Star Jewel&#x27;</p>
<p>Time limit: —</p>
<p>Reward: 3,000 Coins</p>
<p>Failure: There is no failure penalty for this scenario.</p>
<p>* There are special rules for this scenario.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s a star labyrinth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I checked the &#x27;Special Rules&#x27; that followed.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>1. The Labyrinth Keeper appears in the Labyrinth.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Keeper?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Are there even minotaurs?</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>2. The labyrinth is relocated every 3 hours, and when relocated, the entire labyrinth is engulfed in flames and the internal structure is changed.</p>
<p>3. You can avoid the flames by entering the nearby &#x27;Safe Area&#x27; when &#x27;relocating&#x27;. You can choose to escape the labyrinth when entering the &#x27;Safe Area&#x27;.</p>
<p>Then, a timer appeared in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[1 hour and 54 minutes left until relocation.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Look for a &#x27;Safe Area&#x27;.]</p>
<p>Although this was tricky, the pattern itself wasn&#x27;t difficult.</p>
<p>You can survive if you somehow find a &#x27;safe area&#x27; within the time limit.</p>
<p>The question is, how many more of these rules are there?</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">4. &#x27;Dust Man&#x27; is provided to all incarnations who have entered the Labyrinth.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>Then a small lump of dust appeared in the air above my head.</p>
<p>The lump of dust with small eyes looked around, then opened its small mouth and made a sound.</p>
<p>ㅡByeolbyeol</p>
<p>As it was, it circled over my head and started to devour the shiny pieces of gold that were scattered on the floor.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Your &#x27;Dust Man&#x27; has acquired 1 Star Powder.]</p>
<p>Only then did I feel like I was getting a little bit of a sense of what the rules of this dungeon were.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, ahjussi! Look at this!&quot;</p>
<p>Before I knew it, a small dust man had been created beside Shin Yoosoung.</p>
<p>The dustman, who was circling around us with a &#x27;byeolbyeol&#x27; sound, greedily opened his mouth whenever he saw gold dust glittering on the floor.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Your &#x27;Dust Man&#x27; has acquired 1 star dust!]</p>
<p>Seeing the scene, Shin Yoosoung opened her mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;I know what this is.&quot;</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">5. &#x27;Dust Man&#x27; creates star jewels when acquiring a certain amount of &#x27;star dust&#x27;.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>Rules revealed as if they had been waiting.</p>
<p>As expected, the goal of this dungeon was to raise the &#x27;Dust Man&#x27; and obtain the Star Jewels.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">6. &#x27;Dustmen&#x27; in the same group can be combined through [Fusion].</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>Shin Yoosoung asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Shall we put it together?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Great.&quot;</p>
<p>After all, we&#x27;re in the same group.</p>
<p>There was no need to waste efficiency by raising several Dustmen.</p>
<p>When I selected [Fusion], my dust man opened his mouth wide and ate up Shin Yoosoung&#x27;s dust man.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Incarnation Shin Yoosoung’s &#x27;Dust Man&#x27; has been absorbed.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The &#x27;Dust Man&#x27; of the Seoul Station Group is growing.]</p>
<p>Is it because they are combined? The speed at which he collected star dust was much faster than before.</p>
<p>&quot;It keeps moving.&quot;</p>
<p>We continued to explore the labyrinth, calmly maintaining the boundaries of the sandbar.</p>
<p>Traces of a gruesome battle remained at every corner of the road.</p>
<p>The corpses stabbed and cut each other without hesitation, clinging to each other like stains.</p>
<p>Near the corpses, the star dust they had acquired during their lifetimes fell sparsely.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#x27;Abyssal Black Flame Dragon&#x27; says it&#x27;s going to be fun now.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Some constellations are looking forward to your performance]</p>
<p>We picked up the star dust silently, as if we were collecting remains.</p>
<p>Why did these people have to come to this place and die?</p>
<p>Most of these people probably don&#x27;t even know what the &#x27;death sword&#x27; is.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[A small number of constellations hold their tongues.]</p>
<p>No, maybe I know why they died. They died to be a story.</p>
<p>&quot;As expected, good adults die quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>When I looked around, Shin Yoosoung was staring down at the dead woman&#x27;s face.</p>
<p>I also stopped beside Shin Yoosoung and looked down at the dead woman.</p>
<p>An unfamiliar face.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know who this person is.</p>
<p>I probably won&#x27;t know in the future.</p>
<p>But Shin Yoosoung seemed to know.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know this person?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She&#x27;s the one who stopped me when I tried to enter the single-person dungeon.&quot;</p>
<p>I put my hand on the shoulder of Shin Yoosoung, who was standing blankly.</p>
<p>&quot;Shin Yoosoung.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot;</p>
<p>After hesitating for a while, Shin Yoosoung nodded her head.</p>
<p>I couldn&#x27;t read the child&#x27;s expression, so I couldn&#x27;t tell if she was okay or not. But at that moment, Shin Yoosoung&#x27;s retina looked strangely deep.</p>
<p>&quot;People always died even before the scenario.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s true.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It just didn&#x27;t happen right in front of me.&quot;</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t expect to hear such a story, so I was a little surprised.</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung quickly shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry. I said something too cheeky. Sometimes I say strange things without even realizing it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. I also agree with you. Death has always existed. It&#x27;s just that it wasn&#x27;t so explicit.&quot;</p>
<p>People died even before the scenarios started.</p>
<p>Men killed men.</p>
<p>They killed each other and talked about each other&#x27;s death. It&#x27;s a world where it&#x27;s okay to talk like that.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you all right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I’m fine.&quot;</p>
<p>Since it was a world where all gods could exist as &#x27;constellations&#x27;, there was nothing strange about killing people.</p>
<p>However, in a world like that, I rather didn&#x27;t want to believe in anything.</p>
<p>&quot;Do people have souls?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They do.&quot;</p>
<p>Was it because I answered too confidently? Shin Yoosoung asked with her eyes wide open.</p>
<p>&quot;Then where will the dead Younghoon go?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She will go to the underworld.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are there scenarios there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There might be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then, even if I die, it won&#x27;t be any different from here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In a sense.&quot;</p>
<p>Then Shin Yoosoung looked up at me.</p>
<p>&quot;Still, ahjussi, don&#x27;t die.&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Shin Yoosoung as well.&quot;</p>
<p>We prayed for the woman&#x27;s rest in silence. The ashes scattered on the floor looked like the scattered soul of a woman.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Dust Man&#x27;s &#x27;star dust&#x27; has exceeded 100!]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Only in the Star Labyrinth, your physical strength will increase by 1.]</p>
<p>Even in the midst of that, we were getting stronger at the cost of surviving.</p>
<p>I ran into other incarnations several times, but as soon as they saw my &#x27;Blade of Faith&#x27;, they got scared and ran away.</p>
<p>Somehow, it was a day when I didn&#x27;t want to kill anyone, so I thought it was fortunate in my heart.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Star dust obtained so far: 302]</p>
<p>Shin Yoosoung said while looking at the star dust that had already exceeded 300.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahjussi, if it&#x27;s like this-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t say it will go smoothly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p>It was then that the empty Dustman stopped.</p>
<p>-Star?</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Currently, there is almost no &#x27;star dust&#x27; remaining in the &#x27;Star Labyrinth&#x27;.]</p>
<p>Damn, then it is.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no way the &#x27;scenario I knew&#x27; would go so smoothly.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Hunt other incarnations to obtain &#x27;star dust&#x27;.]</p>
<p>After all, this labyrinth is a stage created to induce the incarnations to fight.</p>
<p>How many incarnations must I hunt to collect seven star jewels?</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t want to guess.</p>
<p>It was then that the additional rules came to mind.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">7. Incarnations that have acquired &#x27;Star Jewels&#x27; will have their overall stats rise dramatically.</p>
<p class="orv_line">8. Every time you acquire 1 &#x27;Star Jewel&#x27;, the &#x27;Madness&#x27; level increases.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>…Madness?</p>
<p>ㅡStar!</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Dust Man above my head started shaking like crazy.</p>
<p>The reason was immediately clear.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[There is an incarnation with a star jewel nearby.]</p>
<p>&quot;Ahjussi.&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>A slight vibration was felt on the floor.</p>
<p>Something was coming this way.</p>
<p>&quot;There is one of the &#x27;Seven Kings of Seoul&#x27; around here.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
