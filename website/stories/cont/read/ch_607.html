<p class="orv_line">&quot;Run.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With Killer King&#39;s signal, we ran in the rain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Five raptors ahead.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At my signal, Killer King&#39;s younger sister, Literature Girl 64 stepped forward.</p>
[White and Blue Steel entwined in the claws of both hands, accelerating in an instant, she snapped the necks of the five raptors like millets.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;A 7th grade ahead!&quot;</p>
[A 7th grade earth dragon, ‘Tyrannosaurus Rex’, has appeared!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Grade 7 Earth Dragon, Tyrannosaurus Rex.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The one who got stronger by receiving the power of the black moon knocked down all the hardwoods in front.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It rushed this way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The literary girl didn&#39;t back down and ran to the front of Tyranno.</p>
[Incarnation, &#39;Lee Seyeon&#39;, activates the skill &#39;Battle Action Mode&#39;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Seyeon. It was the name of the person possessed by Literature Girl 64.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since I don&#39;t remember her name, this must be an ordinary extra.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the T-Rex&#39;s paw fell on Literature Girl 64&#39;s head, she shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Brother, now!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I get it.&quot;</p>
[Incarnation, &#39;Kang Ilhun&#39;, has spent 300 coins.]</p></div>
[Incarnation, &#39;Kang Ilhun&#39;, has taken over the &#39;Command Controller&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A small controller appeared in Killer King&#39;s hand. As he entered the command in a flamboyant manner, a bright red aura exploded from Literature Girl 64&#39;s entire body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Using her explosive power, she approached Tyranno&#39;s hind legs, and she stretched out her fist, which was raised strongly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bang!</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a roar, Tyranno&#39;s ankles staggered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">3 consecutive hits.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The enraged Tyranno cried out and swung its huge tail.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His sister exclaimed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Parring!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I get it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When Killer King operated the controller, Literature Girl 64 crossed her arms and radiated magical energy at just the right time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tyranno&#39;s tail bounced off as if it had hit an invisible barrier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a truly phenomenal level of connection.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I never thought I&#39;d see that skill that only applies in games being actually reproduced.</p>
[You have activated 4 Intermediate Commands in a row!]</p></div>
[Penalties for &#39;Battle Action Mode&#39; are activated!]</p></div>
[Command input will be suspended for 30 seconds.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yerin!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Tyranno, who had trodden its foot, stamped it into the ground at random. Literature Girl 64 jumped up the tree.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#39;t a clean move like before, but an appropriate maneuver using innate physicality.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the trees in the area were to be uprooted, Literature Girl 64, guessing, went around Tyranno.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s okay. Now!&quot;</p>
[The penalty for &#39;Battle Action Mode&#39; is lifted!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Literary Girl 64, who caught the timing, got on the Tyranno&#39;s tail and started to run.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A strange smile crept onto Killer King&#39;s mouth as he operated the controller.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Vision yes. Dark Spinning Breaker.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Literature girl 64&#39;s claw spinning like a top in the air is a dark red color.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She ripped out both of Tyrannosaurus&#39; eyes as it turned back, then thrust the claw through the center of its skull.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a thump, Tyranno&#39;s floor bones shattered and its blood spurted out.</p>
[Successfully activated advanced command!]</p></div>
[The battle action mode is canceled.]</p></div>
[General Review: 91 points for linkage! Are you aspiring to be a pro gamer?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The aura disappeared from Literature Girl 64&#39;s body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a sigh, she trudged down from Tyranno&#39;s gigantic body. A slight tiredness was felt in her gait.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What is the linkage score?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;91 points. Too bad.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s better than before.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I still have enough coins left to play a few more times.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What is that?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You gave my technique a strange name.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#39;t remember.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Through that one fight, I got to know the fighting styles of the two.</p>
[Battle Action Mode is literally a skill that allows you to manipulate your strengthened body as if you were playing a fighting action game.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When Literary Girl 64 activates her skill and passes the controller to Killer King, Killer King activates her skill by inputting a command.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a simple, but never easy connection.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A combat method that creates explosive synergies in an instant, with one person focusing on strengthening the body and the other focusing only on the movement of the body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a battle method that was possible because they were two people who fully believed in each other.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King said, perhaps conscious of my gaze.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You seem surprised by the control of this body.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Your sister is really amazing.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you&#39;ve seen it to your heart&#39;s content, take out the secret weapon you&#39;ve been hiding.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We continued running through the forest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was less than a hundred meters to the research building.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Oh oh oh!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps because of the influence of the black moon, the speed of the monsters chasing us is getting faster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were at least twenty hordes of raptors approaching from either side. There were over ten guys blocking the front.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Killer King frowned and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yerin, what is the cooldown time?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There are still three minutes left.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, there is a cooldown for [Battle Action Mode].</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said, speeding up my steps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;ll try it this time.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took a deep breath</p>
[Incite with the “last dragon of the Apocalypse” earlier failed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m not good enough. So, is the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon possible? I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, “Tyranno” was a success.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I am.&quot;</p>
[Exclusive skill, &#39;Incite Lv.6&#39;, is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I am the Snake that Cuts off its Tail.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsutsutsutsu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, there seems to be a penalty for [Inciting] as someone with a higher rank than me. Pain surged through the blood vessels throughout my body, as if electricity were flowing instead of blood, and my consciousness flickered for a moment.</p>
[The constellation, &#39;Tail-Cutting Snake&#39;, looks at you with astonished eyes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Still, it was probably because his level was low, and I was able to withstand this level of aftermath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swallowed the rising blood. I thought I could say at least one word.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Go away!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">All the raptors in front of me were frightened by my cry and ran away.</p>
[&#39;Incite&#39;, is canceled.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My whole body trembled as if I had been electrocuted with the sound of Tsutsutsutsu and Killer King supported me as I stumbled and vomited.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I didn’t know [Incite] could be used like this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheon Inho is more of a fraud than I thought.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We jumped right into the central research building. Fortunately, the 6th-level Earth Dragon hadn&#39;t moved yet, but there was a problem.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Upon entering, the central research building was divided into A and B.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We need to secure an ampoule. You know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The rewards you can get from this movie are various &#39;ability ampoules&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King moved to building B and said to us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You go to Building A with Yerin. I&#39;ll be in charge of Building B.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Will you be okay by yourself?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don’t care.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe because I&#39;m carrying Jeong Heewon on my back, a proper battle is impossible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time, I didn&#39;t hesitate to be considerate. I couldn&#39;t afford to think about that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I searched Building A with Literature Girl 64, and found the place I was looking for within a few minutes.</p>
[Embryology Lab.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">We immediately opened the door and entered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the flasks and ampoules scattered throughout the laboratory, it seemed that we had come to the right place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a transparent incubator, a baby dinosaur was seen as an embryo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">While I was looking at the scene inadvertently, Literature Girl 64 approached me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;They&#39;ll never be born.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Words that I don&#39;t know whether they&#39;re questions or self-talk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I answered at random.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I guess so.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This hidden scenario is just a virtual stage. The moment the movie ends, everything will disappear. The same would be true for these embryonic dinosaurs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Literature Girl 64 said in a nonchalant voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Maybe it&#39;s better not to be born.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking back at her absentmindedly, Literary Girl 64 lowered her head as if avoiding my gaze.</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to my recollection, she had never read the entire book. It was only said that her brother, Killer King, had told her over and over again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How does she feel about being drawn into this world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is this it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes, that&#39;s right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When reading, we quickly found the ability ampoules that appeared in the main story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Comprehensive stat ampoules that increase strength, stamina, sensitivity, and horsepower, respectively.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The total number of ampoules found was twenty-four.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We split the ability ampoules in half each. I decided to take the special ampoule I found additionally.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tyrant T-Rex&#39;s DNA Ampoule.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An item that increases all stats by 10 for 30 minutes when consumed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Considering the last floor of the theater dungeon, this ampoule was a must.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Koo-goo-goo-goo!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The whole building shook precariously as if it had been hit by an artillery shell.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let’s go straight to the roof.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Outside the window, I saw a huge earth dragon getting up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The research buildings are connected to each other</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he has heard the commotion, the Killer King is probably coming up on the roof.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 6th-grade Ji Yong-jong, the master of the Cretaceous period, roars!</p>
[All living things in the area fall into &#39;predation fear&#39;!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The roar that roared through the entire building made me feel like my spine froze for an instant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I quickly activated the skill.</p>
[Exclusive skill, &#39;Incite Lv.6&#39;, is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There is no need to be afraid.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Literary Girl 64, who had been frozen for a while, came back to her senses and climbed the stairs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a roar, the Earth Dragon swung its front paws around as if searching for its prey. All the windows in Building B were destroyed, and the building began to collapse from the corner. It was the same research building where Killer King entered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Literature Girl 64 opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;My brother is strong.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know. Killer King is clearly an excellent incarnation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, his areas of excellence were resourcefulness and fighting, not overall ability or physical abilities.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Above all, the character he possessed was Kang Ilhun, the vice president of the Dongdaemun Group.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much Jophiel was acquired as a sponsor, the probability of surviving that collapse site considering the potential of his incarnation is-</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You are late.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The roof door burst open, revealing Killer King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ampoules?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I got it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When his sister answered, Killer King nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Leave right away.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Earth Dragon, who had spotted us, was gathering his breath towards us.</p>
[The owner of the 6th level Jiryonggun, the Cretaceous, prepares the Cretaceous Silk!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It seems to use something similar to a breath that is a 6th grade earth dragon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, an escape helicopter had arrived on the roof of the research building.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Get on!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">After Literature Girl 64 got on first, she accepted Jung Heewon, who was away from me. Jung Heewon seemed to take quite a while to wake up. As it was, there was no problem in escaping.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However.</p>
[This helicopter is limited to 3 people.]</p></div>
[A new helicopter will be created in 10 minutes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The noise of the helicopters deafened my ears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see Literature Girl 64 shouting something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no way this was it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the main story, it was clear that four people could board the helicopter.</p>
[The &#39;Theater Owner&#39; is satisfied with the ending condition change.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The scenario has changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it&#39;s because the maximum number of people in a “team” is three.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only up to three people can escape at once.</p>
[The constellation, &#39;Snake Cutting off its Tail&#39;, protests!]</p></div>
[The constellation, &#39;Snake Cutting off its Tail&#39;, claims an end to annihilation.]</p></div>
[The &#39;Theater Owner&#39; ignores the constellation&#39;s claim.]</p></div>
[The &#39;Theater Owner&#39; wonders who the final victim will be.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked back at Killer King. He happened to be talking to his sister.</p>
「If it’s these two.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If Jung Heewon were added to the teamwork the two showed, wouldn&#39;t it be possible to prevent a showdown on the rooftop?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took a step back from my blood and thought.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ahhh, the chopper is coming again. You only need to buy 10 minutes while running away somehow. If I use [Incite] to the maximum–</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You ride it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Turning around, Killer King was talking with his back turned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it a hallucination created by an urgent situation?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It felt as if Yoo Joonghyuk was standing there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shook my head and stood next to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;ll stay. You ride there.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The master of the Cretaceous Period&#39;s lungs swelled greatly. Its breath will pour out soon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#39;m ready to use [Incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if I overdo it, let&#39;s become the Snake that cuts its tail one more time. Then I might be able to pick up the direction of its breath a little bit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#39;s a 6th-level earth dragon. It&#39;s not an opponent you can do anything about with [incite].</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You have to do that to know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know even if I don&#39;t try. I&#39;ve read the Revelation 100 times.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wasn&#39;t it 99.8 times?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I reread what I knew in my head.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">You don’t usually say you&#39;ve read that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King asked without giving me a chance to tackle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How many times have you read it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I–&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">“You must have read it over 100 times. I can tell. But.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">After saying that, Killer King put on the black half-glove he took out from his chest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I read it more diligently.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As he took a step forward, an unusual spark flew from his body.</p>
[The constellation, &#39;Commander of the Red Cosmos&#39;, praises the courage of his incarnation.]</p></div>
[The constellation, &#39;Commander of the Red Cosmos&#39;, bestows blessings on his incarnation.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I read it ten times, a hundred times harder than you.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no agitation in Killer King. Even so, at that moment. For some reason, I felt persuaded by Killer King’s words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, Killer King ran towards the “Owner of the Cretaceous Period.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">In an instant, I remembered ORV.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His sponsor is “Commander of the Red Cosmos,” Jophiel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered the way Jophiel fought in the 1863rd round.</p>
「The whole sky howled in agony. At first glance, it was red fog, but if you look closely, each one was a large army of small soldiers. Unit 503 of &lt;Eden&gt; dyed the sky red.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A bloody elite soldier who follows the “Commander of the Red Cosmos.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">The red mist that was now dwelling all over Killer King was neither as thick nor as wide as the one in the 1863rd round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just enough fog to barely protect one person.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Quadddeed!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The breath of the dinosaur from the Cretaceous period colliding with the red mist was dispersing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Get on! We don’t have time!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned around, Killer King&#39;s sister was holding me by the sleeve.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Without hesitating any longer, I boarded the helicopter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The helicopter slowly rose from the ground. Killer King&#39;s appearance quickly began to recede.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The furious Earth Dragon raced towards Killer King. Unfortunately, Killer King&#39;s red fog had already disappeared. The monster&#39;s paws lightly grabbed Killer King&#39;s helplessly exposed body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I was about to stand up from my seat, Killer King&#39;s sister grabbed me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;My brother is strong.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Two people had faith. The faith of a person who has read a certain novel a hundred times, and the faith of a person who has spent that time together.</p>
「A reader who has read a story a hundred times might be able to find even the lost sentences of the writer who wrote the story.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Looking closely, the item held in Killer King&#39;s right hand emitted a faint light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I immediately realized what the item was.</p>
「Petrified Dongja.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Killer King safely got one of the hidden pieces that I wrote down on a note in the box.</p>
「A disposable item that becomes “stone statue” for 4 hours after use.」</p></div>
[Stone Statue status is not easily canceled unless it is hit by at least a constellation level being.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If it was that item, it would surely be able to survive an attack from a 6th-level earth dragon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could see Killer King&#39;s body hardening into solid stone.</p>
[&#39;Ending credit&#39; reached.]</p></div>
[Actors: Cheon Inho, Lee Seyeon, Jung Heewon.]</p></div>
[You obtained 500 coins each as an appearance fee.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 2nd Apostle of the 7 Apostles, Killer King.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man who still believed that this story was not over was looking up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Waving his stiff hand, he seemed to be signaling something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn&#39;t figure out what he meant, but his sister listened to him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I’m curious about the next part.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Those were his words.</p>
