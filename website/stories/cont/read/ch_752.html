            <div class="orv_title"><h1>752 Episode 31 Yoo Jonghyuk (4)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">After 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' left, a message was released.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Due to the scenario's direct change, the start date of the 'Zodiac Ball' is adjusted.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Zodiac Ball' will begin in 12 hours.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently, 71% of the prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[To participate in the 'Zodiac Ball' you must secure an additional 9%.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the process of fighting the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake', our approval rating actually rose despite the fact that a huge number of prisoners died.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I never thought there would be an incarnation that could stand against the &lt;Zodiac&gt;…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone had expectations of us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Zone 13 is in the spotlight because of you guys."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Someone criticized us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I think it would be a good idea to leave Zone 13 at this point."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some people advised us to give up on Zone 13.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was the crane owner in 「The Fox and the Crane」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I would welcome any of the zodiac signs. I have never seen such an outstanding incarnation at Zone 13 of the 'Recycling Center'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to the system, the story of exterminating the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' was widely known throughout Star Stream through the center director.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your new tale spreads widely throughout the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some constellations were greatly impressed by your story.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[18,000 coins were donated through the 'Recycling Center'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As evidence, messages were still being delivered in real time.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A few nebulae want you to join them.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The nebula &lt;Hongik&gt; invites you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The nebula &lt;Tamra&gt; invites you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The nebula &lt;Samyo&gt; invites you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<p class="orv_line">The small and medium-sized nebulae that were being pushed out by the large nebulae sent me messages to do business with me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Among them, there were even &lt;Hongik&gt; and &lt;Tamna&gt;, the nebulae of the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was curious because it was nebulae that did not appear properly in the main story, but I had no intention of choosing them here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was because we were still trapped in the 'Recycling Center' and the scenario related to the &lt;Zodiac&gt; was still in progress.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The faction 'Monkey God' invites you to the 'Zodiac Ball'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The faction 'Dragon God' invites you to the 'Zodiac Ball'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Some factions of the Zodiac also sent invitations to me, as if word had spread that I had declined the tiger's invitation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I have no intention of entering &lt;Zodiac&gt;.»</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I didn't come this far just to join that animal union.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will attend the 'Zodiac Ball' without anyone’s sponsorship."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I needed the support of eighty percent of the prisoners.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And that was the reason why I was now meeting the crane owner.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Many prisoners, including me, are already supporting you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The crane owner, who already knew my situation, sighed lightly and continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But there has never been a representative whose approval rating exceeded 80% in Zone 13."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Just because it’s never happened doesn’t mean it’s impossible."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Now the only ones left are the bears and some other beastmen. But it will be difficult to gain their support."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The prisoners nearby are all supporting me. The only exceptions were the bears that followed the Tiger, and their subordinate forces.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But no matter what I did, I could not persuade them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Because they don’t have any stories left that you can repair."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The prisoners who we were able to persuade all had 'forgotten stories'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We revived those stories through 「Staging」and spread them through the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The prisoners supported us in return. But in the case of the bear beastmen, that was impossible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is there no way?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Honestly, there is none. Wouldn’t it be great if you were a constellation like the 'Master of Fables'? Isn’t it impossible to give individual stories to all of them?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If it's the owner of fables, you're probably referring to the constellation that wrote 'Aesop's Fables'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That’s right. We don’t have enough time."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"They are not people who can listen by simply threatening them with force. In particular, the 'bear that will spare you if you pretend to be dead' is a constellation with strong pride."</p>
<p class="orv_line">He looked down at Yoo Jonghyuk, who was sleeping soundly on the bed, and added:</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Perhaps there is a 'story' that can sweep them all away at once. Can you help me with this?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I helped the crane owner  wake Yoo Jonghyuk up from his sleep and fed him some soup. It was a special soup with the story of 「The Fox and the Crane」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He's the kind of guy who never eats food made by someone else, so I was glad he was unconscious right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After feeding him some soup, Yoo Jonghyuk's pale complexion became a little more lively.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The crane owner sighed lightly and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Anyway, this guy got smaller again, but I was really scared when he cut down the</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’m glad he's smaller."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Anyway, take care of him. I’ll come again."</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those last words, the crane owner left the room.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took a few bites of the soup the owner left behind and looked at Yoo Jonghyuk who was sleeping for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After that incident three days ago, Yoo Jonghyuk had been sleeping ever since.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps due to the side effects of [Story Engraving], Yoo Jonghyuk became little Yoo Jonghyuk again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He wasn't as small as the little Yoo Jonghyuk I saw in the snowfield, but he would probably be like this for a while anyway.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 41st round was the last round for Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He transmitted his experience to his past self through Shin Yoosoung and exited the record of 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I repeat, no one knows what happened to that guy after he left.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Has he stopped regressing in some way, or has he disappeared forever from his records in some way I don't know?</p>
<p class="orv_line">If he had disappeared from his records, would he have finally achieved his wish?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don’t worry too much."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I muttered as I covered the sleeping little boy, Yoo Jonghyuk, with a blanket.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Because this round won’t be ruined so easily."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The person who starts a story has a responsibility not to give up on it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I made a promise to Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Recorder of Things That Will Disappear' responds to your oath.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This story may not be 『Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World』 or 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』, but it will definitely have the right ending.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now it was time to go see the end of this round for that conclusion.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">An hour later, I gathered together the bear beastmen and the beastmen who had not expressed support.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guys seemed taken aback or confused by my sudden call.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some even reacted with hostility .</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Why did you call us?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Their representative was the constellation that invaded this place—'the bear that will spare you if you pretend to be dead'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[If you're calling us to support you, you'd better give up.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Why?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Because we have no intention of supporting you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"So why?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There is no reason to explain that.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Of course you will.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I squatted down in my seat and let out a deep sigh. Then I looked up at the guys.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But you… is it okay for you to continue like that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter what I say, they won't be persuaded by me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason is obvious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because they don't need my help.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What should we do for those who have lost their stories?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe I've been thinking about this problem for quite some time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some extras found their own stories on their own. Like Bang Cheolsoo from Geumho Station. Like the mother and daughter. Like the crane owner.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But not everyone could do it like they did.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some people find their own stories, but others live and die without even knowing what their stories are.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, like the bears in front of me right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Honestly, it doesn’t really matter whether you support me or not. I can rise to the top somehow."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Then why did you call us?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"To give you one last chance."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know that not everyone can purely support me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja also knew that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter what he did, some constellations hated Kim Dokja's story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja pioneered his life by fighting against that gaze, and eventually it also became his story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it wasn't easy for me to accept it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it's because I'm a 'writer'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to write a perfect story that Kim Dokja had never read and that he didn't know about.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Recorder of Things That Will Disappear' responds to your emotions.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But it was impossible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I finally realized it as I went through Geumho Station, Chungmuro, the Theater Dungeon, Gwanghwamun, Washington Dome, and the Recycling Center.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is no story that all the constellations in the world love.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even more so if it is the story of the 'forgotten round'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So I accepted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's okay even if not all prisoners support me. It's safe to say that they hate the stories I'm going to write.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This is truly your last chance. Your chance to choose me by yourself."</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I just write stories.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[What does that mean?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I don’t think there’s any reason to explain what it means."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'the bear that spares Ones Life if Onepretends to be dead' is outraged!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Even a constellation that has lost all of its status still has pride.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[How dare a mere incarnation carry beastmen on its back—!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But he misjudged.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s not just an incarnation."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grinned and looked at him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Until a few days ago, its power was threatening. I thought that he would be a difficult enemy to defeat if I did not use 『Staging』.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Has your eyesight deteriorated and you’ve forgotten how to read stories?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">His status no longer seemed great to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly stood up.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are currently acting as the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The status of the constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' rests fully upon you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As my entire body radiated the majestic energy of stories, bright light began to flow from my incarnation body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some of the prisoners who noticed it were frightened and bowed their heads.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Stand, the constellation…!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even the 'bear that will spare One's Life if One pretends to be dead' was looking at me with shocked eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I lightly placed my hand on the guy's shoulder, his knees slowly began to buckle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy shouted as if he was struggling.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[No matter what you do, it’s useless. We will never do your favor—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, did that sound like a request?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A way to persuade those who have lost their stories, lost their memories, and ultimately lost the ability to read.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’ll tell you again. You only have one choice."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The crane owner said. Those who have lost their own stories are just being swept away by other 'stories' like a torrent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So the only way to persuade them is through 'stories'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story begins 'Incite'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">So, the method I would choose was decided.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Support me.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It becomes the story of 'I will sweep them all away'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[It must be scary to jump into the scenarios again. I know. That's why I'm saying it.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I saw the confused beastmen looking up at me one by one. A faint trace of emotion passed through their dead eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[At least as long as you support me, I will be your 'story'. I will fight on your behalf and become a laughingstock for the constellations on your behalf.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My persuasion was not persuasion.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My words will not be heard in their ears. They are simply overwhelmed by my story and crushed by the status of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So their choice now is,</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Just support me. Then at least you will be able to see the end of this world through me.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, it wasn't a choice.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your approval rating begins to rise.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your approval rating has reached a certain level.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently, 83% of prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was an easy and clear ending.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is scolding you for not doing this sooner.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Reclining Dragon' says that sometimes a decision like that of an 'adventurer who laid an egg' is needed.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'The One Who Brought Ten Lambs' looks at you sadly.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And as always, clear cider,</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'the bear that spares One's life if Onepretends to be dead' rejects your instigation.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'the bear that comes back to life if you pretend to be dead' loses his story and chooses to disappear.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The aftertaste was bitter.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have obtained permission to attend the 'Zodiac Ball'.]</p></div>
