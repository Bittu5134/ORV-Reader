<p class="orv_line">"The 'Recorder of Fear I will choose is—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Needless to say, the Recorder of Fear I will choose is the 'Architect of the False Last Act'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no reason to hesitate.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The true name of that Recorder must be Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The—"</p>
<p class="orv_line">But the moment I said that, a fierce spark flew before my eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Recorder of Fear' in question does not exist on the list.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, I saw it clearly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Right after I killed the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne', I clearly received a message that the 'Architect of the False Last Act’' was interested in my interpretation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I called out the same modifier once again.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Recorder of Fear' in question does not exist on the list.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I asked you to let me meet Han Sooyoung?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time, there was no response at all. The Transcendents nearby who were watching me were muttering, perhaps because they thought my appearance was strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Was there a recorder with that name?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This is the first time I've heard of it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">What on earth could it be?</p>
<p class="orv_line">—Why is that?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja, who only appears when he has something to say, showed up again this time without fail.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Didn't you see it just now?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">—What?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Han Sooyoung was there, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">—What nonsense. Why is Han Sooyoung here?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, it's definitely the 'Architect of the False Last Act'..."</p>
<p class="orv_line">With those words, the call was disconnected again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did the call go through for a moment because of the spark? Anyway, this person is not helpful when it's really important.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, if Kim Dokja didn't see the message, was it only me who saw it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I called out her modifier one last time.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Recorder of Fear' in question does not exist in the list.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Reconfirming the list of 'Recorders of Fear' that are currently available.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>—The Fox Who Commands the Sky</p>
<p>—The Prince of Wolves</p>
<p>—The Demon King of the Cinema</p>
<p>—The Evil Sophist</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">There was none.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even the 'Architect of the False Last Act' was shamelessly taken by the 'Evil Sophist'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, it's not like I took all the lemon candies away, so how can she disappear like this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to protest right away, but I didn't know where to protest. Since even the system message was treated as 'Fear' in the first place, there was nothing to say if there was false information.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was nothing I could do. Right now, I had to choose another 'Recorder of Fear' instead of Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at the list carefully and again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I looked at it so carefully, I felt like I was back in the days of selecting a sponsor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">First, the 'Fox Who Commands the Sky'. If I'm right, this being is the Recorder of Fear I've already met.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Recorder who approached me at the Recycling Center - Bicheonhori.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Considering that his nickname includes the word fox, and that this character was called 'Yoo Joonghyuk's trickster' in 'Ways of Survival', the first choice was definitely 'Bicheonhori Wang Weilong'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That 'Bicheonhori' became a Recorder of Fear... What on earth is the criteria for becoming a Recorder of Fear?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Second, the Prince of Wolves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first thing that came to mind when I saw him was 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That's because I've seen Yoo Joonghyuk transform into a 'black beast' in the 41st Round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is that all? In the main story, Yoo Joonghyuk in the 1,863rd round was also likened to a 'wolf'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There's no way Yoo Joonghyuk in the 41st Round would suddenly become a Recorder of Fear... So, could the 'Prince of Wolves' be 'Secretive Plotter'? My heart raced for a moment, but when I thought about it carefully, it couldn't be true.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you think about the fact that the most revered being of the 'Recorders of Fear' was the 'Secretive Plotter', the strongest Outer God, there was no way that the 'Secretive Plotter' himself could become a Recorder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then... this would most likely be Lycaon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lycaon had previously appeared with the nickname 'Lost Guide', but it was possible that he had risen in rank and acquired a new modifier after our exchange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Third, the Demon King of the Cinema.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, the third one was the hardest to guess. 'Cinema' and 'Demon King'? It felt like two keywords that were far apart were forcibly linked together.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, if you just look at the keywords themselves, there were a few characters that came to mind. At that time, there was only one character in this world line who satisfied both of those keywords at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus, the Demon King of Lust and Wrath. If the guy who had the 'theater' where readers gathered was a 'Recorder of Fear', then the incomprehensible miracles he had committed so far would be somewhat understandable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lastly, the 'Evil Sophist'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What is this... It's probably that guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My worries were short.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I can't meet Han Sooyoung, then I only have one choice anyway.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Meeting Cheon Inho from the 40th Round. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It would be meaningful to meet Bicheonhori and hear his story or meet Lycaon again, but the most valuable information source right now was the 'Evil Sophist'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Evil Sophist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That was the nickname of the '40th Round Cheon Inho'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was curious. What kind of person was the 40th Round Cheon Inho that neither Yoo Joonghyuk nor Anna could properly remember?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did I possess Cheon Inho in the 41st Round?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Evil Sophist' would definitely know that fact. The moment I opened the door with that thought.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your 'interpretation' has been recognized as having special value by the Recorders of Fear.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have been given the opportunity to meet all four Recorders once.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A huge plain unfolded before my eyes along with an unexpected message.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A pleasant breeze brushed the tip of my nose.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I somehow felt like I knew where this was.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Student.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned around, a huge wolf was standing there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Lycaon!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Prince of the Planet Chronos.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The wolf of Immyuntar who sacrificed himself again for me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You entered the room of the Recorder of Fear 'Prince of Wolves'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Student. Since we don't have time, I'll keep it brief.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Before we could even exchange greetings, Lycaon's body was disappearing in the blowing wind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Lycaon?"</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Thank you, student. Thanks to the student's records, I received a new modifier. However, I have not yet recovered enough strength to make contact with student. The reason I came here is...】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lycaon's voice, shouting quickly, dispersed in the wind in real time.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Don't believe any records until you see them with your own eyes! All the 'Recorders' of the Fear Realm are eventually...!]】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Lycaon spoke that far, someone's finger snapping was heard.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【What do you mean, it's useless for a Low-level Recorder to try to cut in?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">And then, as if by magic, Lycaon's room disappeared.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The turn of the Recorder of Fear 'Prince of Wolves' has ended.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What then appeared was a background with a martial arts theme.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have entered the room of the Recorder of Fear 'Fox Who Commands the Sky'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The voices of martial artists could be heard from outside. People eating a light meal of noodles in chicken soup.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Fox Who Commands the Sky— Bicheonhori was in the center of such a peaceful landscape, like a still life painting.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Sit down.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">To be honest, I was a little overwhelmed. The air of detachment I felt from him was strangely different from when I met the Constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I had to compare, I would say it was similar to the feeling I got when I faced Outer gods or Fear.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I carefully sat down in the seat across from him, Bicheonhori quietly raised his hand and ordered the menu.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Two bowls of noodles in chicken broth, please.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The waiter who took his order immediately brought out steaming hot chicken broth and noodles.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A martial arts set out of nowhere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be honest, I didn’t know what was what, but I decided to try it anyway since it was given to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the moment I took a bite, I realized.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 This is the 'real thing'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A taste that seemed to deny all the noodles I’d ever had.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a taste that even Yoo Joonghyuk would have to admit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bicheonhori asked, perhaps because my expression was funny.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Is it delicious?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, it’s delicious."</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Thank goodness. It’s my favorite restaurant. It’s gone now.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It seems that this 'space' was a kind of 'Time Fault' that Bicheonhori owned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We watched the people passing by the guest house for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of soft voices. The smell of ingredients being fried and steamed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in the world of scenarios, there is still peace between the lines.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn’t know which 'Round' this Fault was. However, I thought I knew what this place meant to Bicheonhori.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is this your 'Round'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bicheonhori answered my question after a short pause.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【That’s right. I saw the end of the world in this Round.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The end of the world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The weight of those words suddenly thrown out shook me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Does that mean… you cleared the 'Last Scenario'? Did you see the [Final Wall] by any chance?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bicheonhori just smiled vaguely at my words.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It probably meant that he couldn’t answer. Or it could mean that the deal has already begun.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【That's a question that can only be answered through a deal. Would you like to start the deal?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As expected.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【I'm interested in the 'Natural Disaster-level Fear' that you interpreted.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Because he seemed a bit impatient, Bicheonhori quickly continued speaking.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【With your original status, you would never have been able to hunt the 'Founder of the Absolute Throne'. Even if the 12 gods of &lt;Olympus&gt; came, it would be difficult to hunt him.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"…"</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【But you did it. I want the 'story' behind that achievement.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What I defeated him with was the power of 「Staging」. Bicheonhori must be curious about the true nature of that story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, I didn't intend to give up the only card I had so easily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't plan on passing the interpretation yet. I haven't met the other 'Recorders' either."</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Hmm, I can give you what the other Recorders can't give you. Right now, it seems like you need to quickly achieve transcendence. Isn't that right?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Bicheonhori continued speaking with a smile still on his face.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【As you probably know, your current incarnation body doesn’t fit your rank. In your current state, it’ll be difficult to properly use even 30% of your rank. However, if I help you, things might be different.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I was sincere when I said I had no intention of handing over the interpretation to Bicheonhori right away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That’s because I only had one chance to deal with the 'Recorders of Fear'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Bicheonhori’s offer that followed was tempting even for me.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【I’ll grant you the Time Fault of the &lt;0th Murim&gt;.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;0th Murim&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A place where all kinds of elixirs are abundant, comparable to the stigma of the Nebulae. Considering that you can obtain the treasures of ancient Murim with high difficulty of acquisition and even martial arts skills, it is one of the 'Time Faults' that can be selected at the present time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was considered the top tier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I could just use that place, I would be able to become a Transcendent, and I would also be able to completely unlock the power of a Narrative-grade Constellation.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【Do you need to think about it any more? I can give you whatever you want. Whether it’s the path to becoming a Transcendent or an item.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I was silent for a moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Becoming a Transcendent?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course it’s important.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&lt;The 0th Murim&gt;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It’s truly a fascinating choice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was one more important prerequisite for me than anything else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The most important reason why I came to this place.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【I see. Now that I think about it, you were also a 'Kim Dokja', so how about this?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">But this clever fox seemed to have already figured out the reason.</p>
<div class="orv_outergod"><p>【If you hand me that interpretation, I’ll help you go to the 'Big House'.】</p></div>
