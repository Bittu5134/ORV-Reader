<p class="orv_line">It was then that a sharp dagger flew from among the grass.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, whose complexion changed, pulled out her sword, and I reflexively lowered my back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The dagger that had missed us by a narrow margin became lodged in a tree.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I didn&#39;t expect you to come all this way already.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Three men and a woman appeared in the dense rainforest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Broken Faith” and a white coat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was an outfit that made me laugh out loud.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You are indeed a reader who has read it 100 times.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Misreading Association’s team of writers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How did they come faster than us? I thought we were the fastest, but a faint aura swirled around the illegal writer.</p>
[Incarnation, ‘Yeom Ilwoo’, has a proof of receiving the ‘King of Dice’ surname.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The surname is “King of Dice.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, he had the constellation “The King of Gambling” as his sponsor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Indeed, in that case, it was understandable that he climbed the stage so quickly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Excluding the illegal writer in the center, the two men and woman were also confirmed by using [Characters List] to confirm the identities of the rest of the gang.</p>
[A large number of people have been browsed and temporarily changed to ‘character summary’.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>&lt;Character summary information&gt;</p>
<p>Name: Hamin</p>
<p>Sponsor: Snake that Cut off its Tail</p>
<p>Exclusive Attribute: Lizardman (Rare)</p>
<p>Total stats: [Stamina Lv.14], [Strength Lv.13], [Agility Lv.16], [Magic Power Lv.7]</p>

<p class="orv_line">Name: Kim Jeonhwa</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sponsor: Plague-Bringing Rat</p>
<p class="orv_line">Exclusive Attribute: Ratman (Rare)</p>
<p class="orv_line">Overall stats: [Stamina Lv.18], [Strength Lv.16], [Agility Lv. 11], [Magic Power Lv.6]</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<p>Both were aliens.</p>
<p>On the one hand, ratman, a member of the family of the “Plague-Bringing Rat,” whom he had dealt with before.</p>
<p>The other is the lizardman, a member of the tail-cutting serpent&#39;s family...</p>
<p>Looking at the situation, it was highly likely that the tail-cutting snake was a constellation on the side of the Misreading Association.</p>
<p>I lightly raised both hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait. Do we need to fight among ourselves?&quot;</p>
<p>Half of it was sincere.</p>
<p>The last time I met the Misreading Association was when a reader possessed a constellation, and what I killed was his incarnation, a “character.”</p>
<p>However, the member of the Misreading Association I have to deal with this time is a person who possesses a character. No matter how criminal he is for producing and distributing illegal texts, anyway, he is a person from the same reality as me.</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t be comfortable with him being killed by my hands.</p>
<p>Above all, I thought that the punishment for his wrongdoing had to be paid in reality, not in fiction.</p>
<p>Whatever he thought of my words, the guy smiled mischievously.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s right. I don&#39;t have to fight with the reader who read my novel.&quot;</p>
<p>Still brazen.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I think it would be okay if I just let them pay for their sins here.</p>
<p>&quot;But a reader who has read it 100 times is a bit scary for me.&quot;</p>
<p>With a cool tone, the text writer sent a signal.</p>
<p>The two men and woman on both sides threw five or six daggers from their arms.</p>
<p>It looks like we were attacked like that before.</p>
<p>Looking at the blade flying with a clear killing force, I belatedly recalled Killer King&#39;s warning.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「&quot;The members of the &#39;Misreading Association&#39; deserve to die.&quot;」</p>
<p>I felt like I knew a little bit why he was so terrified.</p>
<p>As Jung Heewon slashed the flying dagger, the dagger was stuck in the floor oxidized while exhaling black smoke.</p>
<p>The floor in contact with the ammunition turned black. It was poison.</p>
<p>&quot;Be careful! You can&#39;t even touch it!&quot;</p>
<p>Last time it was a poison bomb, this time it was poison on weapons.</p>
<p>Tchiiit.</p>
<p>Jeong Heewon&#39;s poisoned knife was melting.</p>
<p>&quot;Heewon-ssi!&quot;</p>
<p>I threw the extra knife I had at Jung Heewon. Jung Heewon who received it well raised her sword with both hands and turned toward the front.</p>
<p>A sword wind blew in front of her eyes, and the trajectories of the additional daggers that flew were all broken.</p>
<p>Perhaps feeling that the situation was not going well, the script writer also jumped into battle.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Incarnation, &#39;Yeom Ilwoo&#39;, activates &#39;Moonlight Steps Lv. 2’!]</p>
<p>The moonlight steps.</p>
<p>He was running while stepping on the steps with a pretty plausible name, but judging from his movements, his average ability was lower than mine.</p>
<p>The guy who rushed leaving a brilliant light every time was a god who was tamed with hot water.</p>
<p>I hit “Broken Faith” forcefully.</p>
<p>&#39;Change into a low-level iron shield.&#39;</p>
<p>At the same time as my command, “Thoughts of Almost Everything” changed into the shape of a shield.</p>
<p>Kagagagak!</p>
<p>The blade bounced off.</p>
<p>The text writer muttered in a surprised voice.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a mysterious item.&quot;</p>
<p>The moment I made contact with his knife, a message came through “Thoughts of Almost Everything”.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The target analysis begins.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Item analysis complete!]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The item is Broken Faith (mass production type).]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The item&#39;s grade is D.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The item is rated low.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Obtain the mimicry form of the item.]</p>
<p>What is it? “Broken Faith” is not real, but “mass-produced”?</p>
<p>Apparently, the mass-produced knife was no longer usable.</p>
<p>The durability of “Broken Faith” ran out due to the ”Blade of Faith” being activated in front of the readers before.</p>
<p>Perhaps the “Blade of Faith” can&#39;t be activated anymore.</p>
<p>The text book writer smiled brightly.</p>
<p>&quot;If I did, would I die?&quot;</p>
<p>A small pot was held by the text writer&#39;s side.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[&#39;Yongjun&#39; demonstrates the mysterious power of regeneration.]</p>
<p>The Pot of Regeneration, Yongjun.</p>
<p>This time I couldn&#39;t help but be surprised.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[D-class item, &#39;Lesser Leather Greaves&#39;, has disappeared as a sacrifice.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[D-class item Broken Faith (Mass Production Type)&#39;s durability has been regenerated.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Broken Faith (mass production type) responds to strong will!]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[‘Blade of Faith&#39;, is activated!]</p>
<p>Tchiiing!</p>
<p>A blue ether blade grew from the sword that touched the shield.</p>
<p>Almost reflexively, I dropped my shield and stepped back.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The mimicry form of &#39;Low Temperance Shield&#39; has been destroyed!]</p>
<p>Both sides almost flew away.</p>
<p>As if he was already confident of winning, he let out a relaxed smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you not know how to use this?&quot;</p>
<p>Hongjun is a reward item that can be obtained at the National Altitude Area Museum. It was an item that could never be obtained in the current scenario.</p>
<p>Except in one way.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that your sponsor spent quite a bit of coins.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My sponsor is a bit rich.&quot;</p>
<p>Towards the script writer who smiled confidently, I replied with a grin.</p>
<p>&quot;How amazing. I don&#39;t think that kind of information was written on the illegal text.&quot;</p>
<p>The script writer&#39;s expression hardened. In the mass-produced “Broken Faith” swordplay, powerful etheric blades began to rage.</p>
<p>I hurriedly avoided the blade and carefully examined his skills.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Incarnation, &#39;Yeom Ilwoo&#39;, is activating &#39;Wolyeong River Lv.1&#39;!]</p>
<p>&quot;Looking at it now, it isn&#39;t even the [White and Blue Steel].&quot;</p>
<p>I expected that.</p>
<p>The last stock of white and blue steel was already bought by Killer King&#39;s younger sister.</p>
<p>The enraged text writer screamed and swung his sword.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Incarnation, ‘Yeom Ilwoo’, activates &#39;Wolyeong Sword Technique Lv.2&#39;!]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Incarnation, &#39;Yeom Ilwoo&#39;, activates &#39;Weapon Improvement Lv.2&#39;!]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Weapon improvement, Wolyeong sword technique, and Wolyeong river were all skills that could be acquired in the early stages.]</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「But with that level of proficiency, it&#39;s worth fighting for.」</p>
<p>Along with the dazzling light, the “Thoughts of Almost Everything” had turned into a bamboo pole.</p>
<p>When “Blade of Faith” collided with the bamboo pole and went away with a metal sound, the script writer opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Of course I knew that my weapon would be cut off. “Ether Blade” in the beginning is that powerful.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s for a low-level item, and this is a holy relic.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation, &#39;Bald General of Justice&#39;, nods happily.]</p>
<p>The man bit his lip hard and swung his sword right away.</p>
<p>Kagagakak!</p>
<p>The blade and the bamboo pole collided, making a sharp scraping sound.</p>
<p>Contrary to the fact that he was quite talkative, his combat sense was not very good.</p>
<p>Even though he has [Wolyeong river], [Wolyeong Sword Technique], and [Weapon Improvement], he doesn&#39;t have the slightest advantage over me.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Prisoner of the Golden Headband&#39; admires the poor sword fighting.]</p>
<p>It was natural.</p>
<p>This guy must have been killing enemies in one blow with the one-tool “Blade of Faith.”</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation, &#39;Abyssal Black Flame Dragon&#39;, advises that you should not pour in support from the beginning because of this.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation, &#39;Mochi-eating Tiger&#39;, clicks his tongue and nods.]</p>
<p>The durability of “Broken Faith” ran out before I knew it, and “Blade of Faith” was broken.</p>
<p>I swung the bamboo stick at the guy&#39;s side without missing a chance. He narrowly escaped, but the hem of his coat was torn and flesh peeled off his side.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation, &#39;The King of Gambling&#39;, is disappointed with his incarnation!]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation who has not yet revealed his modifier advises you to choose your hand carefully from now on.]</p>
<p>He hurriedly backed away, holding back a high-pitched scream.</p>
<p>“What are you doing! Stop watching and help quickly!&quot;</p>
<p>Along with his cry, the ratman and lizardman that Jung Heewon was dealing with began to react abnormally.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation, &#39;Plague-Bringing Rat&#39;, increases the synchronization rate with its incarnation.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation, &#39;Snake that cut off its Tail&#39;, increases the synchronization rate with its incarnation.]</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, who was gradually gaining an advantage with the combo of [Ghost Killing] and [Kendo], closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Tsutsutsutsutsutsutsu!</p>
<p>Blue sparks covered the alien species.</p>
<p>The demonic energy of the alien races, which had been around the 9th level before, had risen to the level of a level 7 monster.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Incarnation, &#39;Hamin&#39;, activates &#39;cursed dagger&#39;!]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Incarnation, &#39;Kim Jeonhwa&#39;, activates stigma&#39; and accelerated attack&#39;!]</p>
<p>Dozens of daggers fell like a waterfall from the arms of the two aliens.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon avoided the weapons with light movements.</p>
<p>But this time something was different.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The special effect of &#39;Cursed Dagger&#39; is activated!]</p>
<p>I suddenly recalled the effects of [Cursed Dagger].</p>
<p>&quot;Heewon-ssi! Stop it this time!&quot;</p>
<p>The [Cursed Dagger] is a stigma that, if you miss 20 dagger hits, you can definitely hit the “next one.”</p>
<p>A black dagger that followed Jung Heewon&#39;s movements finally reached her nose.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon swung her sword and slashed it. With the sound of metal, the dagger&#39;s blade began to melt.</p>
<p>&quot;Aaaaaaa!&quot;</p>
<p>Jung Jaewoo, who was hiding nearby, screamed as he saw the melted knife.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, who grabbed Jung Jaewoo by the back, quickly retreated towards me.</p>
<p>&quot;Inho-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>If this is the case, there is no chance of winning.</p>
<p>Weapons are also weapons, but on the other side, two constellations clung to each other and divided their ranks.</p>
<p>&quot;Jaewoo-ssi, do you have any hidden skills?&quot;</p>
<p>Jung Jaewoo shook his head.]</p>
<p>It must be difficult to trust the [Little Luck] this time as well. Because that&#39;s literally [a little bit of luck].</p>
<p>“Heewon-ssi.”</p>
<p>Jung Heewon nodded.</p>
<p>I gave Jung Heewon the bamboo pole of Ambassador Samyeong that I was holding and said, &quot;Please lend me your ear for a moment.&quot;</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t want to use this skill on Jung Heewon. But now there was no other way.</p>
<p>The text writer shouted as if he felt something strange.</p>
<p>&quot;Kill them! Quickly!&quot;</p>
<p>The aliens, whose bodies had more than doubled in size, roared and charged.</p>
<p>Aliens are not “humans.”</p>
<p>Then can you say that they are “monsters”?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know. But what is certain is, &quot;Every enemy you see in front of you from now on.&quot;</p>
<p>That it will be like that from now on.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a monster.&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Exclusive skill, &#39;Incite Lv.6&#39;, is activated!]</p>
<p>The ratman swung his claws that had grown long, and the lizardman swung his tail, aiming for Jung Heewon&#39;s back.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Incarnation, ‘Jung Heewon’, activates ‘Judgment Time’.]</p>
<p>Sparks lit up in Jung Heewon&#39;s eyes.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation, ‘Maritime War God’, doubts his own eyes.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation, &#39;Bald General of Justice&#39;, admires the descendant&#39;s swordsmanship.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation, ‘Abyssal Black Flame Dragon’ asks if the probability is okay.]</p>
<p>What was happening, I couldn&#39;t even track it with my naked eyes.</p>
<p>Amidst the rising dust, terrifying cracking sounds resounded in succession.</p>
<p>A flash of light soared with the sound of an explosion, and the severed lizardman&#39;s tail and ratman&#39;s arm rolled outside the dust.</p>
<p>Less than a minute later, a series of loud banging sounds came from the cloud of dust.</p>
<p>As the dust slowly subsided, only one person&#39;s shadow stood there.</p>
<p>I saw the corpses of the ratman and the lizardman torn apart.</p>
<p>It was expected, but the result was more than expected.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation, &#39;Plague-Bringing Rat&#39;, vomits blood and exits the channel.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation, &#39;Snake Cutting off its Tail&#39;, cuts its tail to avoid the probability aftermath!]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[The constellation &#39;Snake Cutting off its Tail&#39;, stares dumbfoundedly at &#39;Jung Heewon&#39;.]</p>
<p>Realizing that the battle was unfavorable towards him, the script writer had already broken through the rain forest.</p>
<p>He was just running away.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon picked up one of the dead ratman&#39;s daggers and threw it at him.</p>
<p>Whee-a-a-a-aek!</p>
<p>The weapon flew like a bullet and grazed the guy&#39;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Aaaaaaaaaaagh!?&quot;</p>
<p>He screamed and fled through the rain forest.</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t miss him like this.</p>
<p>He is a man who does not hesitate to stab people. Here, he must definitely stop breathing.</p>
<p>At that time, Jung Heewon fell forward. I could see the aura of judgment that had spread over her whole body fade rapidly fade.</p>
<p>&quot;Heewon-ssi!&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[&#39;Incite&#39;’s effect has disappeared.]</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[&#39;Judgment time&#39; is canceled.]</p>
<p>I hurriedly supported Jung Heewon.</p>
<p>There was no abnormality in her breathing or pulse. However, looking at the nosebleed, it seemed that the aftermath of [Incite] was strong.</p>
<p>&quot;I’ll finish him and come back!&quot;</p>
<p>Seeing the situation, Jung Jaewoo jumped up and ran out, probably gathering his courage.</p>
<p>I shouted while carrying Jung Heewon.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait a minute! Jaewoo-ssi!&quot;</p>
<p>Soon, Jung Jaewoo disappeared into the rainforest in pursuit of the script writer.</p>
<p>Anxiety overtook me.</p>
<p>I followed the footsteps of Jung Jaewoo with Jung Heewon on my back.</p>
<p>Several times in the distance, piercing sounds rang out, and screams were heard. I continued to run after the source of the sound.</p>
<p>And... damn it.</p>
<p>&quot;Jaewoo-ssi!&quot;</p>
<p>Jung Jaewoo was lying between the trees.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[A constellation that has not yet revealed their modifier makes a sad face.]</p>
<p>I breathed in lightly and approached Jeong Jaewoo.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「Jeong Jaewoo has a little bit of luck.」</p>
<p>At least, he won&#39;t die of poison in a place like this. The wound must have avoided vital points.</p>
<p>Jung Jaewoo let out a moan as if in pain.</p>
<p>&quot;Ugh.&quot;</p>
<p>I laid Jung Hee-won on the floor and looked at Jung Jaewoo&#39;s wounds.</p>
<p>“Hey, Inho-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p>Jung Jaewoo was smiling.</p>
<p>&quot;I… I got… a… shot… at him… He… didn’t… get… far…&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#39;t talk.&quot;</p>
<p>A dagger was stuck near Jung Jaewoo&#39;s heart. Upon checking his wounds, the poison had already spread from his chest, melting his skin and intestines.</p>
<p>The blood that fell on the ground soaked the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Stay still.&quot;</p>
<p>Why are you hurt so badly?</p>
<p>Jung Jaewoo must have had [Little Luck]?</p>
<p>Belatedly, it came to my mind that the script writer was the incarnation of the “King of Gambling.”</p>
<p>If the two people&#39;s luck collided with each other, the effect of the attribute was offset.</p>
<p>&quot;Omg…&quot;</p>
<p>Medicines that could cure this wound came to mind.</p>
<p>Elaine Forest Essence?</p>
<p>Too late to use.</p>
<p>Great Healing Elixir?</p>
<p>I checked the dokkaebi’s bag, but it was already out of stock.</p>
<p>Holy oil or something similar?</p>
<p>There was no way to get it now.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「I couldn&#39;t think of a way.」</p>
<p>If there was Lee Seolhwa, she would be able to save him. There’s the Life and Death pills she made.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「She isn’t here now.」</p>
<p>The pages of ORV went through my mind.</p>
<p>I wrote many sentences with my own hands. In the sentences I wrote, there must be a way to save this person.</p>
<p>&quot;It’s alright. I can fix this. Don’t worry.&quot;</p>
<p>A person is dying right in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>My hands trembled and my head wasn&#39;t working well.</p>
<p>I squeezed out the “Elaine Forest Essence” I had and applied it to the wound along with a ointment cream.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the spread of poison, I cut ground rat jerky into small pieces and fed it to him with horn powder from the poisonous rhinoceros.</p>
<p>Jung Jaewoo&#39;s throat wriggled and he started coughing up blood.</p>
<p>Jung Jaewoo muttered while crying.</p>
<p>&quot;I don’t want to die.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You won’t die.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a lie. This person is dying.</p>
<p>My breathing was hoarse, and my voice trembled.</p>
<p>&quot;I’ll save you.&quot;</p>
<p>Because of me, the reader who read my story was dying.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ll save you no matter what.&quot;</p>
<p>In the face of his death, all I could say was a lie.</p>
<p>You won&#39;t die.</p>
<p>Even if you die, I can definitely save you.</p>
<p>Jung Jaewoo&#39;s lips moved. He seemed to be trying to say something, but his voice was muffled.</p>
<p>He seemed to say he shouldn&#39;t have read it, and he seemed to resent the person who wrote it.</p>
<p>After a while. His breathing stopped and his pulse stopped.</p>
<p>&lt;!&gt;[Team member, &#39;Jung Jaewoo&#39;, has died.]</p>
<p>I looked down at Jung Jaewoo&#39;s face for a long time.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve definitely seen people die several times.</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「Jung Jaewoo is dead.」</p>
<p>Still, I didn&#39;t feel it.</p>
<p>Really, I couldn&#39;t believe that the person who was alive a moment ago had passed away.</p>
<p>&quot;Jaewoo-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p>The moment I grabbed his limp hand, I felt something transparent coming out of his body.</p>
<p>I realized that it was Jung Jaewoo&#39;s soul.</p>
<p>He definitely has a soul.</p>
<p>Then I might be able to save him. If we somehow find out where his soul is, then-</p>
<p>Tsutsutsutsutsu.</p>
<p>Sparks flew in the air, and for an instant the outline of the soul thickened.</p>
<p>There was a terrible scream.</p>
<p>A hand snatched his soul in an instant. It disappeared through the torn space and I watched the scene in a daze.</p>
<p>My thoughts didn&#39;t flow as if my head was out of order. I didn&#39;t quite understand what it was. I didn&#39;t quite understand what it was. The only thing I managed to get out of my messed up brain was a single sentence.</p>
<p>If I&#39;m not mistaken, Jung Jaewoo&#39;s soul that disappeared must be—</p>
<p>&lt;&amp;&gt;「He was in the form of a kkoma Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p></p>
