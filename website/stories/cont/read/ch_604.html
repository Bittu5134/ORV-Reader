<p class="orv_line">It was then that a sharp dagger flew from among the grass.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, whose complexion changed, pulled out her sword, and I reflexively lowered my back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The dagger that had missed us by a narrow margin became lodged in a tree.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I didn't expect you to come all this way already."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Three men and a woman appeared in the dense rainforest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Broken Faith” and a white coat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was an outfit that made me laugh out loud.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You are indeed a reader who has read it 100 times."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Misreading Association’s team of writers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How did they come faster than us? I thought we were the fastest, but a faint aura swirled around the illegal writer.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation, ‘Yeom Ilwoo’, has a proof of receiving the ‘King of Dice’ surname.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The surname is “King of Dice.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, he had the constellation “The King of Gambling” as his sponsor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Indeed, in that case, it was understandable that he climbed the stage so quickly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Excluding the illegal writer in the center, the two men and woman were also confirmed by using [Characters List] to confirm the identities of the rest of the gang.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A large number of people have been browsed and temporarily changed to ‘Character Summary’.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<h3 class="orv_window_title">[Character Summary]</h3>
<p>Name: Hamin</p>
<p>Sponsor: Snake That Cut Off Its Tail</p>
<p>Exclusive Attribute: Lizardman (Rare)</p>

<h3 class="orv_window_title">[Character Summary]</h3>
<p>Name: Kim Jeonhwa</p>
<p>Sponsor: Plague-Bringing Rat</p>
<p>Exclusive Attribute: Ratman (Rare)</p>
<p>Overall stats: [Physique Lv.18], [Strength Lv.16], [Agility Lv. 11], [Magic Power Lv.6]</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Both were alien species.</p>
<p class="orv_line">On the one hand, ratman, a member of the family of the “Plague-Bringing Rat,” whom I had dealt with before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The other is a lizardman, a member of the tail-cutting serpent's family…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the situation, it was highly likely that the tail-cutting snake was a constellation on the side of the Misreading Association.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I lightly raised both hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait. Do we need to fight among ourselves?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Half of it was sincere.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The last time I met the Misreading Association was when a reader possessed a constellation, and what I killed was his incarnation, a “character.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the member of the Misreading Association I have to deal with this time is a person who possesses a character. No matter how criminal he is for producing and distributing illegal texts, anyway, he is a person from the same reality as me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't be comfortable with him being killed by my hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Above all, I thought that the punishment for his wrongdoing had to be paid in reality, not in fiction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Whatever he thought of my words, the guy smiled mischievously.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's right. I don't have to fight with the reader who read my novel."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still brazen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thinking about it, I think it would be okay if I just let them pay for their sins here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But a reader who has read it 100 times is a bit scary for me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">With a cool tone, the text writer sent a signal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The two men and woman on both sides threw five or six daggers from their arms.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It looks like we were attacked like that before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the blade flying with a clear killing force, I belatedly recalled Killer King's warning.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "The members of the 'Misreading Association' deserve to die." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like I knew a little bit why he was so terrified.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Jung Heewon slashed the flying dagger, the dagger was stuck in the floor oxidized while exhaling black smoke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The floor in contact with the ammunition turned black. It was poison.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Be careful! You can't even touch it!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Last time it was a poison bomb, this time it was poison on weapons.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tchiiit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jeong Heewon's poisoned knife was melting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I threw the extra knife I had at Jung Heewon. Jung Heewon who received it well raised her sword with both hands and turned toward the front.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A sword wind blew in front of her eyes, and the trajectories of the additional daggers that flew were all broken.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps feeling that the situation was not going well, the script writer also jumped into battle.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation, 'Yeom Ilwoo', activates 'Moonlight Steps Lv. 2’!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moonlight steps.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was running while stepping on the steps with a pretty plausible name, but judging from his movements, his average ability was lower than mine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy who rushed leaving a brilliant light every time was a god who was tamed with hot water.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hit “Broken Faith” forcefully.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Change into 'Old Iron Shield'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time as my command, “Thoughts of Almost Everything” changed into the shape of a shield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kagagagak!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blade bounced off.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The text writer muttered in a surprised voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's a mysterious item."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I made contact with his knife, a message came through “Thoughts of Almost Everything”.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The target analysis begins.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Item analysis complete!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The item is Broken Faith (mass production type).]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The item's grade is D.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The item is rated low.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Obtain the mimicry form of the item.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What is it? “Broken Faith” is not real, but “mass-produced”?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, the mass-produced knife was no longer usable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The durability of “Broken Faith” ran out due to the ”Blade of Faith” being activated in front of the readers before.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps the “Blade of Faith” can't be activated anymore.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The text book writer smiled brightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If I did, would I die?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A small pot was held by the text writer's side.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Yongjun' demonstrates the mysterious power of regeneration.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Pot of Regeneration, Yongjun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time I couldn't help but be surprised.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[D-class item, 'Lesser Leather Greaves', has disappeared as a sacrifice.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[D-class item Broken Faith (mass production type)'s durability has been regenerated.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Broken Faith (mass production type) responds to strong will!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[‘Blade of Faith', is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Tchiiing!</p>
<p class="orv_line">A blue ether blade grew from the sword that touched the shield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Almost reflexively, I dropped my shield and stepped back.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The mimicry form of 'Old Iron Shield' has been destroyed!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Both sides almost flew away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if he was already confident of winning, he let out a relaxed smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you not know how to use this?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yongjun is a reward item that can be obtained at the National Altitude Area Museum. It was an item that could never be obtained in the current scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Except in one way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It seems that your sponsor spent quite a bit of coins."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"My sponsor is a bit rich."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Towards the script writer who smiled confidently, I replied with a grin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How amazing. I don't think that kind of information was written on the illegal text."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The script writer's expression hardened. In the mass-produced “Broken Faith” swordplay, powerful etheric blades began to rage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hurriedly avoided the blade and carefully examined his skills.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation, 'Yeom Ilwoo', is activating 'Wolyeong River Lv.1'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Looking at it now, it isn't even the [White and Blue Steel]."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I expected that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The last stock of white and blue steel was already bought by Killer King's younger sister.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The enraged text writer screamed and swung his sword.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation, ‘Yeom Ilwoo’, activates 'Wolyeong Sword Technique Lv.2'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation, 'Yeom Ilwoo', activates 'Weapon Improvement Lv.2'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">[Weapon Improvement], [Wolyeong Sword Technique], and [Wolyeong River] were all skills that could be acquired in the early stages.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 But with that level of proficiency, it's worth fighting for. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Along with the dazzling light, the “Thoughts of Almost Everything” had turned into a bamboo pole.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When “Blade of Faith” collided with the bamboo pole and went away with a metal sound, the script writer opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course I knew that my weapon would be cut off. “Ether Blade” in the beginning is that powerful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But that's for a low-level item, and this is a star relic.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', nods happily.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The man bit his lip hard and swung his sword right away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kagagakak!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blade and the bamboo pole collided, making a sharp scraping sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Contrary to the fact that he was quite talkative, his combat sense was not very good.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though he has [Wolyeong River], [Wolyeong Sword Technique], and [Weapon Improvement], he doesn't have the slightest advantage over me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' admires the poor sword fighting.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was natural.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This guy must have been killing enemies in one blow with the one-tool “Blade of Faith.”</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', advises that you should not pour in support from the beginning because of this.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, 'Rice Cake-Eating Tiger', clicks his tongue and nods.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The durability of “Broken Faith” ran out before I knew it, and “Blade of Faith” was broken.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swung the bamboo stick at the guy's side without missing a chance. He narrowly escaped, but the hem of his coat was torn and flesh peeled off his side.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, 'The King of Gambling', is disappointed with his incarnation!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation who has not yet revealed his modifier advises you to choose your hand carefully from now on.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He hurriedly backed away, holding back a high-pitched scream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“What are you doing! Stop watching and help quickly!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Along with his cry, the ratman and lizardman that Jung Heewon was dealing with began to react abnormally.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, 'Plague-Bringing Rat', increases the synchronization rate with its incarnation.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, 'Snake That Cut Off Its Tail', increases the synchronization rate with its incarnation.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who was gradually gaining an advantage with the combo of [Ghost Killing] and [Kendo], closed her eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsutsutsutsu!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Blue sparks covered the alien species.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The demonic energy of the alien species, which had been around the 9th level before, had risen to the level of a level 7 monster.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation, 'Hamin', activates 'Cursed Dagger'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation, 'Kim Jeonhwa', activates stigma' and accelerated attack'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Dozens of daggers fell like a waterfall from the arms of the two aliens.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon avoided the weapons with light movements.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But this time something was different.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The special effect of 'Cursed Dagger' is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly recalled the effects of [Cursed Dagger].</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-ssi! Stop it this time!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The [Cursed Dagger] is a stigma that, if you miss 20 dagger hits, you can definitely be hit by the “next one.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">A black dagger that followed Jung Heewon's movements finally reached her nose.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon swung her sword and slashed it. With the sound of metal, the dagger's blade began to melt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aaaaaaa!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo, who was hiding nearby, screamed as he saw the melted knife.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon, who grabbed Jung Jaewoo by the back, quickly retreated towards me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If this is the case, there is no chance of winning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Weapons are also weapons, but on the other side, two constellations clung to each other and divided their ranks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Jaewoo-ssi, do you have any hidden skills?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo shook his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It must be difficult to trust the [Little Luck] this time as well. Because that's literally 'a little bit of luck'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Heewon-ssi.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I gave Jung Heewon 'Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick' that I was holding and said, "Please lend me your ear for a moment."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't want to use this skill on Jung Heewon. But now there was no other way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The text writer shouted as if he felt something strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kill them! Quickly!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The aliens, whose bodies had more than doubled in size, roared and charged.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Aliens are not “humans.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then can you say that they are “monsters”?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don't know. But what is certain is, "Every enemy you see in front of you from now on."</p>
<p class="orv_line">That it will be like that from now on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's a monster."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.6', is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The ratman swung his claws that had grown long, and the lizardman swung his tail, aiming for Jung Heewon's back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation, ‘Jung Heewon’, activates ‘Judgment Time’.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Sparks lit up in Jung Heewon's eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, ‘Maritime War God’, doubts his own eyes.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', admires the descendant's swordsmanship.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, ‘Abyssal Black Flame Dragon’ asks if the probability is okay.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What was happening, I couldn't even track it with my naked eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Amidst the rising dust, terrifying cracking sounds resounded in succession.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A flash of light soared with the sound of an explosion, and the severed lizardman's tail and ratman's arm rolled outside the dust.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Less than a minute later, a series of loud banging sounds came from the cloud of dust.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the dust slowly subsided, only one person's shadow stood there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw the corpses of the ratman and the lizardman torn apart.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was expected, but the result was more than expected.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, 'Plague-Bringing Rat', vomits blood and exits the channel.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation, 'Snake That Cut Off Its Tail', cuts its tail to avoid the probability aftermath!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Snake That Cut Off Its Tail', stares dumbfoundedly at 'Jung Heewon'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Realizing that the battle was unfavorable towards him, the script writer had already broken through the rain forest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was just running away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon picked up one of the dead ratman's daggers and threw it at him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Whee-a-a-a-aek!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The weapon flew like a bullet and grazed the guy's shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aaaaaaaaaaagh!?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">He screamed and fled through the rain forest.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't miss him like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He is a man who does not hesitate to stab people. Here, he must definitely stop breathing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that time, Jung Heewon fell forward. I could see the aura of judgment that had spread over her whole body fade rapidly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Heewon-ssi!"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Incite'’s effect has disappeared.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Judgment Time' is canceled.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I hurriedly supported Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no abnormality in her breathing or pulse. However, looking at the nosebleed, it seemed that the aftermath of [Incite] was strong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’ll finish him and come back!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Seeing the situation, Jung Jaewoo jumped up and ran out, probably gathering his courage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shouted while carrying Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait a minute! Jaewoo-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Soon, Jung Jaewoo disappeared into the rainforest in pursuit of the script writer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anxiety overtook me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I followed the footsteps of Jung Jaewoo with Jung Heewon on my back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Several times in the distance, piercing sounds rang out, and screams were heard. I continued to run after the source of the sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And… damn it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Jaewoo-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo was lying between the trees.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation that has not yet revealed their modifier makes a sad face.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I breathed in lightly and approached Jung Jaewoo.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Jung Jaewoo has a little bit of luck. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At least, he won't die of poison in a place like this. The wound must have avoided vital points.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo let out a moan as if in pain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ugh."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I laid Jung Heewon on the floor and looked at Jung Jaewoo's wounds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">“Hey, Inho-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo was smiling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I… I got… a… shot… at him… He… didn’t… get… far…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't talk."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A dagger was stuck near Jung Jaewoo's heart. Upon checking his wounds, the poison had already spread from his chest, melting his skin and intestines.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blood that fell on the ground soaked the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Stay still."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why are you hurt so badly?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo must have had [Little Luck]?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Belatedly, it came to my mind that the script writer was the incarnation of the “King of Gambling.”</p>
<p class="orv_line">If the two people's luck collided with each other, the effect of the attribute was offset.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Omg…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Medicines that could cure this wound came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Elaine Forest Essence?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Too late to use.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Great Healing Elixir?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I checked the dokkaebi’s bag, but it was already out of stock.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Holy oil or something similar?</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no way to get it now.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I couldn't think of a way. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If there was Lee Seolhwa, she would be able to save him. There’s the Life and Death pills she made.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 She isn’t here now. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The pages of ORV went through my mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wrote many sentences with my own hands. In the sentences I wrote, there must be a way to save this person.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It’s alright. I can fix this. Don’t worry."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A person is dying right in front of my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My hands trembled and my head wasn't working well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I squeezed out the “Elaine Forest Essence” I had and applied it to the wound along with a ointment cream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order to avoid the spread of poison, I cut ground rat jerky into small pieces and fed it to him with horn powder from the poisonous rhinoceros.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo's throat wriggled and he started coughing up blood.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo muttered while crying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don’t want to die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You won’t die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's a lie. This person is dying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My breathing was hoarse, and my voice trembled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I’ll save you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Because of me, the reader who read my story was dying.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll save you no matter what."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the face of his death, all I could say was a lie.</p>
<p class="orv_line">You won't die.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if you die, I can definitely save you.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Jaewoo's lips moved. He seemed to be trying to say something, but his voice was muffled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He seemed to say he shouldn't have read it, and he seemed to resent the person who wrote it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a while. His breathing stopped and his pulse stopped.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Team member, 'Jung Jaewoo', has died.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at Jung Jaewoo's face for a long time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I've definitely seen people die several times.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Jung Jaewoo is dead. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Still, I didn't feel it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Really, I couldn't believe that the person who was alive a moment ago had passed away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Jaewoo-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I grabbed his limp hand, I felt something transparent coming out of his body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I realized that it was Jung Jaewoo's soul.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He definitely has a soul.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then I might be able to save him. If we somehow find out where his soul is, then-</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsutsutsutsutsu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sparks flew in the air, and for an instant the outline of the soul thickened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a terrible scream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A hand snatched his soul in an instant. It disappeared through the torn space and I watched the scene in a daze.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My thoughts didn't flow as if my head was out of order. I didn't quite understand what it was. The only thing I managed to get out of my messed up brain was a single sentence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I'm not mistaken, Jung Jaewoo's soul that disappeared must be—</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 He was in the form of a kkoma Kim Dokja. 」</p></div>
