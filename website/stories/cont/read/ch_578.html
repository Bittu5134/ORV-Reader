<p class="orv_line">After realizing that this world was the &#x27;41st round&#x27; of Ways of Survival, Kyung Sein slowly</p>
<p class="orv_line">dropped to the ground and began to do planks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi was speechless for a while, as if he hadn&#x27;t realized what was happening yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t stop them and waited for a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could hear Kyung Sein counting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Nine, ten, eleven.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, I saw Bang Cheolsoo talking to Dayoung&#x27;s mother.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Cheolsoo-ssi, how come you&#x27;re so fearless and brave?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Haha, the life I&#x27;ve lived is a little different than most people.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I wanted to slap Bang Cheolsoo on the back of the head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty...... Inho-ssi.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What do we do now?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, no amount of planking could give him an answer, because he collapsed to the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I helped him to his feet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s okay, there&#x27;s Dansoo ahjussi and Sein-ssi. And Sein-ssi said you&#x27;ve read Omniscient</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reader&#x27;s Encyclopedia or something like that ten times.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What&#x27;s the point of reading that? This is not Omniscient Reader, it&#x27;s Ways of Survival. The 41st</p>
<p class="orv_line">round is barely mentioned in the novel. The only thing that is mentioned is.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know. It&#x27;s all about how bad Yoo Joonghyuk was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just because this world is the 41st round, some of the methods Kim Dokja used are now</p>
<p class="orv_line">obsolete.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Still, we can&#x27;t give up yet. It&#x27;s still early in the scenario.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But it&#x27;s the 41st round! Yoo Joonghyuk is a scumbag!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi, who finally realized the seriousness of the situation, muttered his daughter&#x27;s</p>
<p class="orv_line">name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, memories of the days when I was writing my manuscript came back to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I was writing the &#x27;Disaster of Floods&#x27; episode, in which the Shin Yooseung from the 41st</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">round was a disaster, I received a letter from a reader at the management office.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk can&#x27;t be such a bad guy. Honestly, 41st round Yoo Joonghyuk is a plot hole,</p>
<p class="orv_line">please fix it immediately.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a letter that said something like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the time, I thought, &#x27;Who are you, asshole?&#x27; But now that I think about it, the reader was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I should have just fixed it then.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He&#x27;ll become trashier and trashier, but maybe he&#x27;s not irredeemable yet. Even in Omniscient</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reader, Yoo Joonghyuk was a psychopath at first. He changed later on, so maybe there&#x27;s a</p>
<p class="orv_line">chance for him here.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">You can&#x27;t rewrite people, but you can rewrite characters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It&#x27;s funny that I&#x27;m defending a guy who tried to kill me, but I&#x27;m not going to lose hope yet.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation who hasn&#x27;t revealed their modifier is looking at you.]</div>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is looking at you.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">man in the black coat looks like a bad guy.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">As long as you carry out the scenarios, you will continue to run into Yoo Joonghyuk. You can&#x27;t</p>
<p class="orv_line">just keep avoiding him every time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, you&#x27;ll need his help to clear the final chapter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Especially if this is &#x27;Ways of Survival&#x27; instead of &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If possible, I&#x27;ll be the one to contact Yoo Joonghyuk from now on. You should avoid him no</p>
<p class="orv_line">matter what.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Will you be alright?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;After all, I he gave me the &#x27;Elaine Forest Essence&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Isn&#x27;t that just to take advantage of Inho-ssi?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#x27;s what I think, too, so that&#x27;s good, because he won&#x27;t kill me right away if I&#x27;m worth using.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;d left something like that because he still has expectations on me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Besides, I didn&#x27;t tell them, but there were still secrets in this &#x27;41st round&#x27; that I didn&#x27;t know about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, there&#x27;s some kind of deal between Cheon Inho and Yoo Joonghyuk from the</p>
<p class="orv_line">previous round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There&#x27;s no need to think about it right now. We&#x27;ll just have to find out slowly from now on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">will be up.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Please be patient with us, constellations-nim.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We&#x27;re talking about something important.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#x27;t be discouraged, just do what you can. Our pace isn&#x27;t bad either. Heewon-ssi has</p>
<p class="orv_line">awakened, Dansoo ahjussi knows how to tame bugs, Sein-ssi has [Average Correction], and</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Sein-ssi, you&#x27;re puting all your coins on physique, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. Of course, but.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected from the soul of a muscular man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Kyung Sein could play the tanker role, the party now had a basic formation of damage dealersupport-tanker.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So what&#x27;s my position?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ve got Cheon Inho who can carry the eloquence role, so we&#x27;re not that far behind &lt;Kim</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dokja&#x27;s Company&gt;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein laughed weakly at my joke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, Dansoo ahjussi, who was already in high spirits, nodded his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi is right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You recovered quickly.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is nothing.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You&#x27;re not from a different world than ours, are you?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Jiyoon will be disappointed if I get frustrated over this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps the most frustrated person here is Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He&#x27;s not even a devoted reader of Omniscient Reader, he&#x27;s just a guy who ended up possessing</p>
<p class="orv_line">someone in the novel because of his daughter.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">I became a little curious about what kind of life Dansoo ahjussi had that led him possess</p>
<p class="orv_line">someone here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s go get the hidden piece first. We were lucky enough to start at Geumho Station, so we</p>
<p class="orv_line">have an advantage over everyone else.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah! Do you mean, to get &#x27;that&#x27;.......?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yep. Let&#x27;s go get it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At Geumho Station, there is a representative hidden piece that Kim Dokja gets.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The star relic, &#x27;Unbroken Faith&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order to get it, you must go to the &#x27;Edge of Darkness&#x27; of Geumho Station and enter the &#x27;Ground</p>
<p class="orv_line">Rat&#x27;s Treasure Trove&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi&#x27;s expression was dark.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If that&#x27;s the case, we&#x27;d better hurry.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, right. Actually.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein said as she jumped to her feet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There are people who have already set out that way.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">No, you should have told me that first, guys.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">We quickly finished our preparations and stood in the tunnel leading to the Yaksu Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought about waiting for Jung Heewon to wake up, but I was impatient that there were people</p>
<p class="orv_line">who had already left ahead of us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don&#x27;t worry about Heewon-ssi and go.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">When Dayoung&#x27;s mother opened her mouth as if to leave it to her, Bang Cheolsoo thumped his</p>
<p class="orv_line">chest and spoke up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ll protect Geumho Station!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dayoung&#x27;mother nodded reliably and looked at Bang Cheolsoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at the two figures for a moment, a weird atmosphere beginning to form. Something has</p>
<p class="orv_line">definitely changed, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s for the better.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s go.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We stepped into the tunnel, and in an instant, the voices grew quieter, followed by another deep</p>
<p class="orv_line">darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time, it was Kyung Sein who spoke up first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s not fair to wake up Heewon-nim and come back again, is it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You said you fed her Elaine Forest Essence, so she won&#x27;t wake up even if you try.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But we don&#x27;t even have a DPS[1] now...... Isn&#x27;t it dangerous?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We don&#x27;t have much time left. If they passed through here twenty minutes ago, they might have</p>
<p class="orv_line">already entered the &#x27;Edge of Darkness&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, I didn&#x27;t expect anyone to go first. Kim Dokja in the original novel was still in the</p>
<p class="orv_line">middle of his hidden scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;How many people went first?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Two, a man and a woman. They came down from upstairs all of a sudden.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Were they readers?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Actually, this was a question to get her thinking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She answered immediately.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don&#x27;t know, but I guess so, because the timing doesn&#x27;t allow for any characters to pass by here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#x27;t get a good look at them because they were going too fast on their bikes, but.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A bike? This early on?</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;But Inho-ssi, you do know that there&#x27;s a boss monster at the &#x27;Edge of Darkness&#x27;, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yes. I know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">For reference, there is an initial boss monster in the &#x27;Edge of Darkness&#x27;, the &#x27;Dark Keeper&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, there was a way to deal with it in Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein asked, her eyes shining with anticipation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did you happen to buy [Purest Sword Force] or the &#x27;Broken Faith&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shook my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">no sellers for Broken Faith, only a long waiting list.</p>
<p class="orv_line">-Why is everyone getting that crappy item? Is there some kind of patch I don&#x27;t know about?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein&#x27;s expression darkened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Then we won&#x27;t be able to catch the &#x27;Dark Keeper&#x27;? Even in the original, Kim Dokja barely beat</p>
<p class="orv_line">it with the combo of [Purest Sword Force] and &#x27;Broken Faith&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ll think about it as we go.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you don&#x27;t have &#x27;Broken Faith&#x27;, you can&#x27;t make &#x27;Unbroken Faith&#x27;.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;First of all, we should get the random item box.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is a &#x27;random item box&#x27; in the Ground Rat&#x27;s Treasure Trove, which is guarded by the &#x27;Dark</p>
<p class="orv_line">Keeper&#x27;, that allows you to &#x27;upgrade items&#x27; in the first use.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja used the box to upgrade his &#x27;Broken Faith&#x27; to &#x27;Unbroken Faith&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein shook her head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Well, you can get &#x27;Broken Faith&#x27; later. Do you remember all the boss patterns?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is the physique to perform the pattern.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened the rewards messages I&#x27;d been putting off.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There are currently 3 unclaimed rewards.]</div>[There are currently 3 unclaimed rewards.]</p>

<p class="orv_line">Unfortunately, I only received half of the reward because the final hit was stolen by the Sea</p>

<br>
<p class="orv_line">The next reward, however, was more than enough to make up for the disappointment.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Looting rewards?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wait a minute.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Does it mean there was an incarnation hunting the &#x27;Sea Commander&#x27;?</p>
<p class="orv_line">My head was spinning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to the main story of Omniscient Reader, it was Kim Dokja who hunted down the &#x27;Sea</p>
<p class="orv_line">Commander&#x27; and earned the reward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since there will most likely not be a Kim Dokja in this round, it must be a regular reader who</p>
<p class="orv_line">read Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What happened to that reader?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation &#x27;Sneaking Schemer&#x27; chuckles.]</div>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' chuckles.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I feel sorry for that reader, but 6,000 coins for the looting was a great harvest anyway.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And that wasn&#x27;t the only reward.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have claimed the constellations&#x27; sponsorship rewards.]</div>[You have claimed the constellations' sponsorship rewards.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[6,800 coins have been sponsored.]</div>[6,800 coins have been sponsored.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon&#x27;s awakening scene was quite popular on the &lt;Star Stream&gt;, and we received a</p>

<p class="orv_line">Prisoner of the Golden Headband, Abyssal Black Flame Dragon, and the nice animal</p>

<p class="orv_line">But I&#x27;m different.</p>
