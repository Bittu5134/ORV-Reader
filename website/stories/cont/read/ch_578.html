<p class="orv_line">After realizing that this world was the '41st round' of Ways of Survival, Kyung Sein slowly</p>
<p class="orv_line">dropped to the ground and began to do planks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi was speechless for a while, as if he hadn't realized what was happening yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't stop them and waited for a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could hear Kyung Sein counting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Nine, ten, eleven......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, I saw Bang Cheolsoo talking to Dayoung's mother.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Cheolsoo-ssi, how come you're so fearless and brave?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Haha, the life I've lived is a little different than most people."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I wanted to slap Bang Cheolsoo on the back of the head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty...... Inho-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What do we do now?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, no amount of planking could give him an answer, because he collapsed to the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I helped him to his feet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's okay, there's Dansoo ahjussi and Sein-ssi. And Sein-ssi said you've read Omniscient</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reader's Encyclopedia or something like that ten times."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What's the point of reading that? This is not Omniscient Reader, it's Ways of Survival. The 41st</p>
<p class="orv_line">round is barely mentioned in the novel. The only thing that is mentioned is......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know. It's all about how bad Yoo Joonghyuk was.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just because this world is the 41st round, some of the methods Kim Dokja used are now</p>
<p class="orv_line">obsolete.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Still, we can't give up yet. It's still early in the scenario."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But it's the 41st round! Yoo Joonghyuk is a scumbag!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi, who finally realized the seriousness of the situation, muttered his daughter's</p>
<p class="orv_line">name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, memories of the days when I was writing my manuscript came back to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I was writing the 'Disaster of Floods' episode, in which the Shin Yooseung from the 41st</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">round was a disaster, I received a letter from a reader at the management office.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk can't be such a bad guy. Honestly, 41st round Yoo Joonghyuk is a plot hole,</p>
<p class="orv_line">please fix it immediately.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a letter that said something like that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the time, I thought, 'Who are you, asshole?' But now that I think about it, the reader was right.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I should have just fixed it then.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He'll become trashier and trashier, but maybe he's not irredeemable yet. Even in Omniscient</p>
<p class="orv_line">Reader, Yoo Joonghyuk was a psychopath at first. He changed later on, so maybe there's a</p>
<p class="orv_line">chance for him here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">You can't rewrite people, but you can rewrite characters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It's funny that I'm defending a guy who tried to kill me, but I'm not going to lose hope yet.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">man in the black coat looks like a bad guy.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">As long as you carry out the scenarios, you will continue to run into Yoo Joonghyuk. You can't</p>
<p class="orv_line">just keep avoiding him every time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, you'll need his help to clear the final chapter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Especially if this is 'Ways of Survival' instead of 'Omniscient Reader'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If possible, I'll be the one to contact Yoo Joonghyuk from now on. You should avoid him no</p>
<p class="orv_line">matter what."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Will you be alright?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"After all, I he gave me the 'Elaine Forest Essence'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Isn't that just to take advantage of Inho-ssi?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's what I think, too, so that's good, because he won't kill me right away if I'm worth using."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I'm sure he'd left something like that because he still has expectations on me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Besides, I didn't tell them, but there were still secrets in this '41st round' that I didn't know about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, there's some kind of deal between Cheon Inho and Yoo Joonghyuk from the</p>
<p class="orv_line">previous round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There's no need to think about it right now. We'll just have to find out slowly from now on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">will be up.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Please be patient with us, constellations-nim.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We're talking about something important.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't be discouraged, just do what you can. Our pace isn't bad either. Heewon-ssi has</p>
<p class="orv_line">awakened, Dansoo ahjussi knows how to tame bugs, Sein-ssi has [Average Correction], and</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Sein-ssi, you're puting all your coins on physique, right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. Of course, but......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected from the soul of a muscular man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Kyung Sein could play the tanker role, the party now had a basic formation of damage dealersupport-tanker.</p>
<p class="orv_line">So what's my position?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I've got Cheon Inho who can carry the eloquence role, so we're not that far behind <Kim</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dokja's Company>."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein laughed weakly at my joke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, Dansoo ahjussi, who was already in high spirits, nodded his head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Inho-ssi is right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You recovered quickly."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This is nothing."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You're not from a different world than ours, are you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Jiyoon will be disappointed if I get frustrated over this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps the most frustrated person here is Dansoo ahjussi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He's not even a devoted reader of Omniscient Reader, he's just a guy who ended up possessing</p>
<p class="orv_line">someone in the novel because of his daughter.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">I became a little curious about what kind of life Dansoo ahjussi had that led him possess</p>
<p class="orv_line">someone here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's go get the hidden piece first. We were lucky enough to start at Geumho Station, so we</p>
<p class="orv_line">have an advantage over everyone else."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah! Do you mean, to get 'that'.......?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yep. Let's go get it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At Geumho Station, there is a representative hidden piece that Kim Dokja gets.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The star relic, 'Unbroken Faith'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order to get it, you must go to the 'Edge of Darkness' of Geumho Station and enter the 'Ground</p>
<p class="orv_line">Rat's Treasure Trove'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dansoo ahjussi's expression was dark.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If that's the case, we'd better hurry."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, right. Actually......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein said as she jumped to her feet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There are people who have already set out that way."</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">No, you should have told me that first, guys.</p>
<hr>
<p class="orv_line">We quickly finished our preparations and stood in the tunnel leading to the Yaksu Station.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought about waiting for Jung Heewon to wake up, but I was impatient that there were people</p>
<p class="orv_line">who had already left ahead of us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't worry about Heewon-ssi and go."</p>
<p class="orv_line">When Dayoung's mother opened her mouth as if to leave it to her, Bang Cheolsoo thumped his</p>
<p class="orv_line">chest and spoke up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll protect Geumho Station!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dayoung'mother nodded reliably and looked at Bang Cheolsoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at the two figures for a moment, a weird atmosphere beginning to form. Something has</p>
<p class="orv_line">definitely changed, but I don't know if it's for the better.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's go."</p>
<p class="orv_line">We stepped into the tunnel, and in an instant, the voices grew quieter, followed by another deep</p>
<p class="orv_line">darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time, it was Kyung Sein who spoke up first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's not fair to wake up Heewon-nim and come back again, is it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You said you fed her Elaine Forest Essence, so she won't wake up even if you try."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But we don't even have a DPS[1] now...... Isn't it dangerous?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We don't have much time left. If they passed through here twenty minutes ago, they might have</p>
<p class="orv_line">already entered the 'Edge of Darkness'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, I didn't expect anyone to go first. Kim Dokja in the original novel was still in the</p>
<p class="orv_line">middle of his hidden scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How many people went first?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Two, a man and a woman. They came down from upstairs all of a sudden......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Were they readers?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Actually, this was a question to get her thinking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She answered immediately.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't know, but I guess so, because the timing doesn't allow for any characters to pass by here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't get a good look at them because they were going too fast on their bikes, but......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A bike? This early on?</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">"But Inho-ssi, you do know that there's a boss monster at the 'Edge of Darkness', right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">For reference, there is an initial boss monster in the 'Edge of Darkness', the 'Dark Keeper'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, there was a way to deal with it in Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein asked, her eyes shining with anticipation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Did you happen to buy [Purest Sword Force] or the 'Broken Faith'?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shook my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">no sellers for Broken Faith, only a long waiting list.</p>
<p class="orv_line">-Why is everyone getting that crappy item? Is there some kind of patch I don't know about?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein's expression darkened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then we won't be able to catch the 'Dark Keeper'? Even in the original, Kim Dokja barely beat</p>
<p class="orv_line">it with the combo of [Purest Sword Force] and 'Broken Faith'."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll think about it as we go."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you don't have 'Broken Faith', you can't make 'Unbroken Faith'......."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"First of all, we should get the random item box."</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is a 'random item box' in the Ground Rat's Treasure Trove, which is guarded by the 'Dark</p>
<p class="orv_line">Keeper', that allows you to 'upgrade items' in the first use.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja used the box to upgrade his 'Broken Faith' to 'Unbroken Faith'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein shook her head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, you can get 'Broken Faith' later. Do you remember all the boss patterns?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem is the physique to perform the pattern.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened the rewards messages I'd been putting off.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There are currently 3 unclaimed rewards.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I hit the collect button one by one.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The scenario was cleared early due to the intervention of other sea species.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have received part of the scenario's reward.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[2,000 coins have been earned.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Unfortunately, I only received half of the reward because the final hit was stolen by the Sea</p>
<p class="orv_line">Commander.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The next reward, however, was more than enough to make up for the disappointment.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The incarnation you awakened, 'Jung Heewon', hunted the 'Sea Commander'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'Commander Slayer' that someone was performing.]</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A portion of the looted reward is attributed to you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[4,000 coins have been earned.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[2,000 additional coins have been earned for your first looting reward.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Looting rewards?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wait a minute.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Does it mean there was an incarnation hunting the 'Sea Commander'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">My head was spinning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">According to the main story of Omniscient Reader, it was Kim Dokja who hunted down the 'Sea</p>
<p class="orv_line">Commander' and earned the reward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since there will most likely not be a Kim Dokja in this round, it must be a regular reader who</p>
<p class="orv_line">read Omniscient Reader.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What happened to that reader?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Sneaking Schemer' chuckles.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I feel sorry for that reader, but 6,000 coins for the looting was a great harvest anyway.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And that wasn't the only reward.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have claimed the constellations' sponsorship rewards.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[6,800 coins have been sponsored.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon's awakening scene was quite popular on the <Star Stream>, and we received a</p>
<p class="orv_line">significant amount of sponsorships for such an early stage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Prisoner of the Golden Headband, Abyssal Black Flame Dragon, and the nice animal</p>
<p class="orv_line">constellations donated coins.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[14,800 coins have been earned in total.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Coins Possessed: 17,100 C]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I'm rich now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I were Kim Dokja, I'd be saving this like it was my last dollar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I'm different.</p>
