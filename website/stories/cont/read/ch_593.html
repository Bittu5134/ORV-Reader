        <article class="orv_main">
            <div class="orv_title"><h1>593 Episode 8. Representative Kim Dokja (3)</h1></div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">At the sound of RepresentativeKimDokja&#39;s words, the chatter of readers calling each other&#39;s</p>
<p class="orv_line">names and nicknames quickly died down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As a heavy silence settled over the room, I could see the reader&#39;s appearances clearly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They ranged in age from teenagers to people in their 60s.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some looked like friends and siblings, others wore aprons as if they were cooking. Some were</p>
<p class="orv_line">dressed in neat suits, while others were in their pajamas, shyly hiding by a pillar.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Apparently, this was a place where everyone would show themselves as they were &#39;just before</p>
<p class="orv_line">they were transmigrated&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter what kind of person the readers were, their demeanor was the same here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A deep silence, not even the sound of breathing could be heard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Eventually, RepresentativeKimDokja spoke again.</p>
【I&#39;m sure you all have a lot of questions, but you are not saying anything.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Everyone who had survived so far were veterans.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Old-timers who had survived the hell of the first and second scenarios.</p>
<p class="orv_line">off. You all know the clichés very well.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if he understood, RepresentativeKimDokja&#39;s lips curled into a smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">questions you want.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">The readers looked at each other.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if RepresentativeKimDokja said that, it wasn&#39;t easy to believe him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, he had the power to summon all the readers here.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">He could probably kill everyone here with a snap of his fingers.</p>
「That is, of course, if my guy can handle the &#39;probability&#39;.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the original&#39;s beginning of the scenarios, it was impossible for a high-grade constellation to</p>
<p class="orv_line">descend in their true form or summon such a large number of incarnations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s why I was able to raise my hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsuchuchuchut.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A spark has been flowing faintly through his body since earlier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no way that a man who was already overdoing it would carry out a showmanship of</p>
<p class="orv_line">killing an incarnation like a dokkaebi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there was a reader who raised his hand faster than I did.</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja pointed to him and said.</p>
【Oh, go ahead.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He looked to be in his mid-to-late teens, and he was quite a memorable reader, with his unique</p>
<p class="orv_line">serious eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Who are you, and where am I?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">where is this place?】</p>
<p class="orv_line">Inhaling lightly, RepresentativeKimDokja looked back at the other readers and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">story. I&#39;m just—】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you Kim Dokja?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Several readers gasped at the boy&#39;s question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That&#39;s probably the biggest question on most people&#39;s minds here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this &#39;RepresentativeKimDokja&#39; the &#39;Kim Dokja&#39; we know?</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">—】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Come to think of it, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re Kim Dokja.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The boy&#39;s voice was subtly hostile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja paused.</p>
【What made you think that?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;There is no way Kim Dokja would bring us to a dangerous place.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy&#39;s voice was calm and rational.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Next to him stood a girl who seemed to be his family, but her eyes were unusually closed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It didn&#39;t seem to be because she had narrow eyes like Cheon Inho, but because of other</p>
<p class="orv_line">circumstances.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After staring at the two, RepresentativeKimDokja smiled.</p>
【Are you two siblings?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s none of your business—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did you come up with such a naive idea?】</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the boy clenched his fists and frowned, the girl tightened her grip on his sleeve as if to</p>
<p class="orv_line">restrain his movements.</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja laughed in satisfaction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">wouldn&#39;t have let the old woman die in the first scenario.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought the line was somehow familiar, and then I remembered that I had written a similar</p>
<p class="orv_line">scene in Omniscient Reader.</p>
【He led people to stab each other to death at Geumho Station.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it was during the &#39;Duet Between Good and Evil&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Seoul citizens to die.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">Everything RepresentativeKimDokja said was true.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the readers didn&#39;t seem to be shaken by his words.</p>
【Do you really believe that such a Kim Dokja wouldn&#39;t bring you in for his own purposes?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;He wouldn&#39;t.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">【Why?】</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Because I am a fragment of that &#39;Kim Dokja&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a girl across from him who cut the boy off.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A girl about Jiyoon&#39;s age.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know because I&#39;m a fragment of Kim Dokja. Kim Dokja wouldn&#39;t do this.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The conviction in her voice was so strong that even I was stunned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The girl really believed in Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe she wasn&#39;t the only one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you really &#39;RepresentativeKimDokja&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even an ahjussi who had been watching the conversation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#39;ve messaged RepresentativeKimDokja before, but you don&#39;t sound like him.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The others, who had been timidly backing away, also chimed in.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you trying to say? We know what kind of person Kim Dokja is better than you do.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Why are you dressed as Kim Dokja in the first place? Just reveal your identity.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">As he listened in silence, RepresentativeKimDokja took a deep breath. When I swallowed my</p>
<p class="orv_line">breath, it felt like all the oxygen around me suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned around, I saw that not only me, but also the others had turned pale.</p>
【That bastard Kim Dokja.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As I felt my breath return, RepresentativeKimDokja spoke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">much?】</p>
<p class="orv_line">He sounded like he had a grudge against Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">doesn&#39;t care how many extras die in his dreams.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like someone was poking me in the head with a needle.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Part of me knew that. In a way, I knew it was possible to think like that.</p>
【In your favorite story, was Kim Dokja really a good person?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A giant screen floated up behind RepresentativeKimDokja. The screen showed a scene from the</p>
<p class="orv_line">scenario. Judging from the atmosphere, it wasn&#39;t the world line we were on a moment ago.</p>
「&quot;I wish to see the novel&#39;s epilogue.&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a story in a novel that I once wrote and the readers once read.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From the first scenario to the last. The long journey of the protagonist, Kim Dokja, and &lt;Kim</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dokja&#39;s Company&gt;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja&#39;s story, from Kim Dokja&#39;s point of view, for Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">chosen by Kim Dokja live?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Beneath the feet of &lt;Kim Dokja&#39;s Company&gt;, who marched toward the end of the world,</p>
<p class="orv_line">nameless corpses piled up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Their souls cried out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were in that world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were part of this story too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But Kim Dokja didn&#39;t look back at them.</p>
【I believe you know the truth about what it&#39;s like to be an extra in this world.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The readers were speechless for a moment. Even those who had been defending Kim Dokja were</p>
<p class="orv_line">unable to say anything for once.</p>
<p class="orv_line">On the screen, a close-up of an incarnation dying alone in a scenario change. A lonely</p>
<p class="orv_line">incarnation dying without the gaze of any stars.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He looked at me and said.</p>
「&quot;Save me.......&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe someone between us is possessing that incarnation now. Now that death wasn&#39;t just an</p>
<p class="orv_line">extra&#39;s story.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">It was our story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;What are you trying to say?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was I who spoke.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you asking us to relieve some dead extra&#39;s resentment? That&#39;s why you dragged us into this</p>
<p class="orv_line">damn world?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja grinned from ear to ear, and then a message popped up in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if that was his answer.</p>
[&lt;Star Stream&gt; agrees to register you a new sub scenario.]</p></div>
[A new sub scenario has arrived!]</p></div>
<br>
<div class="orv_window">
<p></p>
<p>&lt;Sub Scenario(???) — Christian Qualifications&gt;</p>
<p>Category: Sub (Personal)</p>
<p>Difficulty: ???</p>
<p>Clear Conditions: You have been transmigrated into the world line through an &#39;Outer World</p>
<p>Covenant&#39;. Work with the other transmigrated people to prevent its predestined destruction and</p>
<p>develop a new story.</p>
<p>Time Limit: —</p>
<p>Reward: Return to the original world line and additional rewards.</p>
<p>Failure: Death</p>
<p></p>
</div>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">To a certain extent, this was expected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We are from another world, just like Kim Dokja when he went to the 1,863rd turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was only natural that there would be a scenario to return to the original world line.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was the content.</p>
「Prevent its predestined destruction and develop a new story.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Prevent the predestined destruction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In other words, RepresentativeKimDokja summoned us because he wanted to change the ending</p>
<p class="orv_line">of this world line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could hear the boy who had first spoken to him earlier muttering.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;As expected, an &#39;Outer World Covenant&#39;.......&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked around and saw that some of the readers had already calmed down and started</p>
<p class="orv_line">calculating.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The hope that if they could somehow prevent the destruction of this world, they could return to</p>
<p class="orv_line">the original world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As they gathered their thoughts, a few raised their hands and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Wait, you have to tell us where this world is. Is this Yoo Joonghyuk&#39;s &#39;3rd turn&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Is &lt;Kim Dokja&#39;s Company&gt; also here somewhere?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Where is Kim Dokja now? Is he with us?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">At that moment, everyone had a similar thought in their minds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The surest way to prevent the end of the world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Borrowing the power of those who had already &#39;stopped the destruction&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But.</p>
【Why do you want to know that?】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja didn&#39;t seem to like the question.</p>
<p class="orv_line">haven&#39;t come to your senses.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">The readers who had been asking questions shivered at the cold voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja sighed softly and shook his head.</p>
【Keep this in mind. You are the protagonists of this world, and this world exists only for you.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He swept his gaze across the room with a strange glint in his eye, then added with a slight smile.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">【Please, make a story worthy of being written on the &#39;Last Wall&#39;. That way, this world will not be</p>
<p class="orv_line">forgotten in vain.】</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why is it? His last words sounded sincere.</p>
【This is the end of this Banquet. See you next time.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja&#39;s figure disappeared into thin air, and pillars of light began to appear</p>
<p class="orv_line">everywhere. One by one, the summoned people were returning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The surprised readers called out each other&#39;s names.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After regaining our senses, Kyung Sein and I looked at each other.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We hadn&#39;t found Dansoo ahjussi&#39;s daughter yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We hurriedly called out Jiyoon&#39;s name and searched through the rest of the crowd. Then, I</p>
<p class="orv_line">bumped shoulders with someone. I turned around and saw the boy who confronted</p>
<p class="orv_line">RepresentativeKimDokja earlier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy frowned and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hm? By any chance, you—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The boy, along with the girl next to him, was engulfed in a pillar of light and disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a matter of moments, the crowd had shrunk to less than half.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now there were no readers who looked Jiyoon&#39;s age.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">A pillar of light rushed right next to me and then Kyung Sein&#39;s figure disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Almost simultaneously, the feeling of Dansoo ahjussi on my back disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A deep sense of emptiness washed over me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t find anyone after all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was then that a familiar backside caught my eye.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A small back, light brown bob hair that fell to her shoulders.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, my heart beat wildly.</p>
「The person who made me a writer was there.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The one who never gave up on me, even when everyone else in the editorial department did.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">My editor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ji Eunyoo-ssi!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was alive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew she would be alive.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment Ji Eunyoo turned around, a pillar of light descended from thin air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyoo&#39;s surprised eyes looked at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt my breath catch in my throat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no time. We couldn&#39;t even afford to ask each other who the other was possessing. All</p>
<p class="orv_line">we could do was shout,</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Gwanghwamun!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">We could only agree on a meeting place.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ji Eunyoo was the last one, there was no one left in the theater.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was left alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Soon, I would be gone too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sighed lightly and waited for my turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One minute, two minutes.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">I kept waiting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Three minutes, four minutes.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something was wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much time passed, my body was not enveloped in a pillar of light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What was going on?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I absentmindedly looked up at the ceiling, where the lights were flickering intermittently.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Excuse me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked, but no one answered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hey!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I called out a little louder, but still no answer.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I hesitated for a moment, then made a decision.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I decided to explore the area a bit more.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, there&#39;s something that&#39;s been bothering me since earlier.</p>
<p class="orv_line">.......</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I listened, I heard a faint sound. I didn&#39;t hear it wrong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There is someone else in this theater besides me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound was coming from the entrance to the theater tucked away in one corner of the lobby.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In front of the theater&#39;s door was a sign that said &#39;playing&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wonder what&#39;s playing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A movie?</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I cautiously opened the theater door, a feeling of anticipation flashed through my mind.</p>
「&quot;Inho-ssi? Inho-ssi, wake up!&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The familiar voice triggered a series of memories. Slowly, a chill ran down my spine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew this place.</p>
「&quot;Why is Inho-ssi the only one who didn&#39;t wake up?&quot;」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The view of Chungmuro Station reflected on the vast screen, and there were my companions</p>
<p class="orv_line">waking me up from my collapse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And then.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The backs of countless &#39;kkoma Kim Dokjas&#39; watching the scene.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the same movie theater I had seen in my dream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The kkoma Kim Dokjas I met that day were not part of a dream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I took a stumbling step into the theater, a kkoma Kim Dokja looked back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The name tag pinned to his left chest shook.</p>
<p class="orv_line">rlaehrwk37.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as the kkoma Kim Dokja&#39;s eyes widened and he was about to say something to me,</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">something grabbed me by the back of the head and yanked me hard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a cold grip that sent a chill down my spine.</p>
【You shouldn&#39;t have seen that.】</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The voice was icy cold.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I turned my head, RepresentativeKimDokja was looking at me.</p>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">Author&#39;s Note</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thank you.</p>
