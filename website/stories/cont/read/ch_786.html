<p class="orv_line">Can I win?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Actually, I&#x27;ve never thought about it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Youngest.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this world, fighting that &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27;—and Kim Dokja who became a constellation at that. This is something that no one but a crazy person would ever do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You could die, you know?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Isn&#x27;t dying our specialty?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">And yet, why am I doing something like this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;No, our specialty isn&#x27;t dying.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s dying and coming back to life.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is this also proof that &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27;s legend&#x27; is flowing to me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You can&#x27;t come back to life. You built both your traits and legends wrong.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;So you think I&#x27;m going to die?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation smiled quietly without answering.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I answered that smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ll be the first Kim Dokja who will never die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation burst into laughter, perhaps because my words were funny.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;m looking forward to that&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Please look forward to it. Because right now, I need the support of even just one more &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27;.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Above the blade-like wind, we exchanged sword strikes as if on cue.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When the [Way of the Wind] I compressed exploded in the sword fight, Kim Dokja also responded with his skillful [Way of the Wind]. The magical powers of both sides were canceled out, creating harmony in the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The tale of the Demon King of Salvation seeped through the clashing blades.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story &#x27;self-willed pervert&#x27; found a story to pervert!]</div>[The story 'self-willed pervert' found a story to pervert!]</p>

<div class="orv_quote"><p>「This is a world without a ‘king’ right now.」</div>「This is a world without a ‘king’ right now.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the story began its storytelling, the form of &#x27;thoughts&#x27;, which had been disguised as &#x27;Unbreakable Faith&#x27;, changed.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「His sword was born rejecting all the thrones of the world.」</div>「His sword was born rejecting all the thrones of the world.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#x27;Thoughts &#x27; soon took the form of ´&#x27;Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword&#x27;. The day the legend 『King of a Kingless World』 was created, the very sword that destroyed the 「Absolute Throne」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cold sweat ran down my back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I faced that sword, even a constellation would die. In fact, Kim Dokja had a precedent of defeating constellations from the 「Twelve Zodiac Signs」 with that sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation warned.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You know? This legend cannot be accepted unless you are a &#x27;king&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">With no time to answer, the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword sword flew at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swung the &#x27;Unbreakable Faith&#x27; that I held with both hands with all my might. With a bang, my body was pushed back. The solid sentences of the legend were transmitted as a shock.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt it once again. What kind of life he had lived, what kind of legend he had built.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What he was made of.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But I couldn&#x27;t just give in here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Have you forgotten whose agent I am?&quot;</p>

<p class="orv_line">I took out the real Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword from my inventory to confront him and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;And I didn&#x27;t clear the &#x27;Absolute Throne&#x27; carelessly either.&quot;</p>

<p class="orv_line">I thought of Han Sooyoung.</p>

<div class="orv_quote"><p>「&quot;Why did you want to be a writer?&quot;」</div>「"Why did you want to be a writer?"」</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if answering that question, I swung my sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you are Kim Dokja who destroyed the &#x27;Absolute Throne&#x27;—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellation of the shining Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword flared up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I am &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27; who killed the bastard who created that &#x27;Absolute Throne&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Dokja. This story exists just to prove those three syllables made up of consonants and vowels.</p>

<p class="orv_line">The two stories resonated and howled.</p>

<p class="orv_line">Above all, 「King of a Kingless World」 is a legend, while 「Heir of the Eternal Name」 is a quasi-mythical tale that is continuously growing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The power of the overflowing tale engulfed the Demon King of Salvation. Even as he was helplessly pushed back, the Demon King of Salvation did not lose his composure. His expression seemed to indicate that he had expected this much.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I guess you&#x27;ve already forgotten. Who was with you when that story was made?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in the midst of the storm of stories, the Demon King of Salvation did not lose his dignity.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if he knew that this story could not harm him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When he gently swung his sword as if cutting through the clouds, the sentences of the story that had been covering him split apart as if by magic.</p>

<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation, who completely nullified my story, looked at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Just kidding.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Let&#x27;s really empty it.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since we&#x27;re both readers, we can&#x27;t strike back with a half-hearted story.</p>

<p class="orv_line">We&#x27;re the ones who are more familiar with directing than anyone else in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>

<p class="orv_line">A series of characters came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I chose one character without hesitation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation was the same.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Bookmark number 2.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Bookmark number 5.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Characters in different bookmarks. However, what we called was in a sense the &#x27;same character&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will activate &#x27;Judge of Evil&#x27; Jung Heewon.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I will activate &#x27;Judge of Destruction&#x27; Jung Heewon.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The two Jung Heewons were possessed by each other.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One is Evil. The other is Destruction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One is a judge who exerts herstrongest power only on &#x27;villains&#x27;. And the other side is the judge who exerts the strongest power only on &#x27;monsters&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the moment when the match that could never come true came true under the name of &#x27;Kim Dokja&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kuwagwagwagwa!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the sword energy and energy collided, a sound that seemed to burst my ears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A scene of sword fighting that could not be followed with the eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I and the Demon King of Salvation held our breath and endured the power of Jung Heewon that we had read.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Hmph.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Every moment I swallowed my breath, a fierce battle of wits took place. Twenty, fifty, eighty. As the sums increased, I could feel the trajectory of the reading that the Demon King of Salvation had read from Jung Heewon&#x27;s sword fighting.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「When Heewon-ssi uses her sword, move your arm like this.」</div>「When Heewon-ssi uses her sword, move your arm like this.」</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「When using a superior sword, always use an honest and precise thrust.」</div>「When using a superior sword, always use an honest and precise thrust.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could not lose either.</p>

<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Faster, stronger. Heewon-ssi&#x27;s sword was more intense than this.」</div>「Faster, stronger. Heewon-ssi's sword was more intense than this.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is the readers&#x27; battle. The one who reads more fiercely and bookmarks more meticulously wins the battlefield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was gradually out of breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was hard to follow the interpretation of Jung Heewon by the Demon King of Salvation. To be honest, I was impressed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They really are different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon in the 1,864th round is really amazing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But it seems that the Demon King of Salvation was also impressed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;It&#x27;s quite good. Heewon-ssi in the 41st round is also very strong.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Whose sword is it?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just as Jung Heewon in the 3rd round became Kim Dokja&#x27;s sword, Jung Heewon in the 41st round became my sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The one who swung more swords than anyone else to protect us.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment when different interpretations met at the same conclusion, the clashing blades made a loud noise once again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A situation where life and death were at stake in a single sword strike.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, we were laughing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Heewon-ssi is really an amazing person.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;She&#x27;s a great person.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If it weren&#x27;t for her, I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to see the end of the scenarios.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I&#x27;ll probably have the same story someday.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This fight is fun.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That Heewon-ssi has a peculiar habit of her right foot.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That Heewon-ssi is so honest in her swordsmanship.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This time of sharing stories that I like is so enjoyable. As the interpretation continued, sentences that could kill each other flashed through my mind one after another.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I want to show him this interpretation. I want to share this story that I know with him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That greed made me throw a decisive move.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Activate &#x27;Time of Judgment&#x27;!]</div>[Activate 'Time of Judgment'!]</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon of the 41st round is the &#x27;Judge of Destruction&#x27;.</p>

<div class="orv_quote"><p>「It&#x27;s not enough yet.」</div>「It's not enough yet.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon of the 41st round has more overwhelming talent than any other Jung Heewon of any other world line. [Bookmark] alone is not enough to show that.</p>

<p class="orv_line">The path of the sword opened in my head, and all the Jung Heewons I know were embedded in my body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The best &#x27;Jung Heewon&#x27; that I can recreate now was swinging the sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Will the Demon King of Salvation accept this interpretation? Will you be able to break the history we have built?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You really read hard.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even in front of the flying blade, the Demon King of Salvation was still Kim Dokja.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This is the first time I&#x27;ve seen a Heewon-ssi like that.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you stay still like that, you&#x27;ll die!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Die?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment he snickered, the scenery around me felt a slight ripple.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Aren&#x27;t you underestimating your brother?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sword I swung bounced up with a loud cracking sound.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Time of Judgement, Gwisal, and Jung Heewon&#x27;s strike with the power of Kendo.]</div>[Time of Judgement, Gwisal, and Jung Heewon's strike with the power of Kendo.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation accepted that strike. How?</p>

<p class="orv_line">I opened my eyes wide.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no way. &#x27;Jung Heewon&#x27;, who the &#x27;Demon King of Salvation&#x27; had borrowed just now, was the &#x27;Judge of Evil&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And the &#x27;Judge of Evil&#x27; could only be used when the opponent was an &#x27;evil person&#x27;—and only with the consent of the constellations of the &#x27;absolute good&#x27; lineage.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now he was a &#x27;Demon King&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No constellation of the &#x27;absolute good&#x27; lineage would lend him their power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But how—</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a moment, I felt strange. My hair stood on end, and my spine creaked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt death drawing near.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I reflexively took a dozen steps back, and the surrounding scenery looked different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The familiar railroad and platform. Why didn&#x27;t I notice it before?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「Staging.」</div>「Staging.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn&#x27;t a real staging, but it seemed like he had activated a kind of 「simple staging」 by paying for probability.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You seem to have forgotten who you were, youngest.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In that moment, I realized how he had activated [Time of Judgment].</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ha.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The creativity of the Demon King of Salvation was truly unimaginable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The insight that replaced the conditions of agreement of the absolute good constellations with the power of 「Staging」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The [Time of Judgment] that the Demon King of Salvation had just activated was not something from this world, but something borrowed from a &#x27;different world line&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All the events of this simple stage &#x27;already happened&#x27; in some world line.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Geumho.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled bitterly as I looked at the familiar writing on the platform.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King of Salvation asked with a grin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You said you would become Kim Dokja who would never die, right?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was the station where &#x27;Cheon Inho&#x27; was born, and the station where my scenario began.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「The Judge of Evil. The strongest judge among the three great judges, just woke up in Geumho.」</div>「The Judge of Evil. The strongest judge among the three great judges, just woke up in Geumho.」</p>
<p class="orv_line">But this &#x27;Geumho Station&#x27; is not the 41st round, but the 1,864th round. It is the very place where Jung Heewon, who was the &#x27;crouching figure&#x27;, awakened as the &#x27;Judge of Evil&#x27;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#x27;villain&#x27; Cheon Inho of &#x27;Omniscient Reader&#x27;s Viewpoint&#x27; dies here from the sword of &#x27;Judge of Evil&#x27; Jung Heewon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;See if you can survive, youngest.&quot;</p>
