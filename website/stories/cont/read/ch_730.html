            <div class="orv_title"><h1>730 Episode 28 House (8)</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I think so too.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a situation like this, who doesn&#39;t know that something is wrong?</p>
<p class="orv_line">My mind was complicated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was the ending also a problem?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Constellations prefer certain revenge, unexpected developments, and exciting endings. But what I chose was the lukewarm ending called &#39;Reconciliation with Wolves&#39;.</p>
[Some constellations belonging to the nebula &lt;Zodiac&gt; are criticizing your actions!]</p></div>
[A very small number of constellations look dissatisfied with the outcome you chose.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, the constellations would not like it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If you think about it, something similar happened when Kim Dokja declared that he would not kill the &#39;Disaster of Floods&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Geaaaa—!</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;The Wolf Who CovetsLittle Red Riding Hood&#39; began to struggle and howl. The guy, who had hit his head on the floor several times as if in pain, opened his eyes wide and looked up into space.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the same for me, little Yoo Jonghyuk, and the rest of the group.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Something was coming down the black open portal outside. At first, I thought it was an Outer God, but fortunately, that wasn’t the case.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The first thing I saw was a pig&#39;s head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I saw the whitish tail, a slight shiver ran down my spine.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no shock like when I met the Outer God or when the great-grade constellations descended.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, my senses were warning me.</p>
[The constellation &#39;The First Pig To Die&#39; is glaring at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">They are the ones who occupy the lower sky of this star stream.</p>
[The constellation &#39;Pig that builds houses out of wood&#39; is staring at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">They were great figures of the Chinese Zodiac.</p>
[The constellation &#39;liverless rabbit&#39; is looking down at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Indirect messages from the constellations announcing their appearance one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As many as three constellations appeared at once, which would have been startling under normal circumstances.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, despite that, there wasn&#39;t enough pressure felt.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking closely, I saw that each of the powerful constellations had the appearance of a symbol.</p>
<p class="orv_line">...Is that why?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;The first pig to die&#39; was a pig&#39;s head with a bill in its mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;Pig that builds houses out of wood&#39; is a log with a pig tail growing like sprouts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lastly, the &#39;liverless rabbit&#39; was in the form of a bright red raw liver.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyway, I never imagined that the constellations would come directly as symbols. This is because, no matter how &#39;symbolically&#39; they descended, descending into a lower-level scenario incurs a considerable probability cost.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In my mind, I remembered the record of &#39;Ways of Survival&#39; regarding the &#39;Recycling Center&#39;.</p>
「The Recycling Center is a kind of floating castle that travels around lower-tier scenarios.」</p></div>
「The Recycling Center has a thin border with the other world in order to accommodate &#39;various types of stories&#39;.」</p></div>
「Constellations that have been recognized for their area within the Recycling Center can use symbols at a relatively low cost.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps the reason the constellations were able to descend as symbols was because of the special environment of the Recycling Center.</p>
<p class="orv_line">By the way, why did those bastards attempt to &#39;descend symbolically&#39; at this moment?</p>
<p class="orv_line">They probably know that it&#39;s dangerous because they can&#39;t fully use their original power if they are in a symbolic state.</p>
[It’s been a while, wolf.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My doubts were quickly answered.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I heard their mantra, I realized it right away.</p>
[It’s still a smelly place.]</p></div>
[Are there any new turtles?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The fact that they took risks and attempted to &#39;descend symbolically&#39; shows that they are confident.</p>
[All the prisoners in Zone 13 kneel in front of the Nebula Zodiac.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was proof that no one in this &#39;Zone 13&#39; would dare to oppose them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The owner of the crane and the beastmen who were hiding in each house ran out of the house one by one to show their respect.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The same was true for our group. Ye Hyunwoo, Kyung Sein and Cha Yerin, and Dansu ahjussi were all prostrated on the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It would not be their own will. This was simply the power of the Zodiac, the nebula of animals.</p>
[The constellation &#39;The Wolf Who Loves Little Red Riding Hood&#39; pays homage to the owner of the story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Little Red Riding Hood’s wolf was also bowing his head to the floor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only ones who didn&#39;t kneel were Killer King, who was tied to a chair, me, and little Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&#39;The First Pig To Die’ stared at me quietly and then  spoke to the wolf constellation.</p>
[Have you forgotten your &#39;contract&#39; with us?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The wolf growled and his shoulders shook.</p>
[No. Absolutely not.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t understand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That one was just a pig and this one was a wolf.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the laws of the ecosystem and the logic of the law of the fittest, it was clear that carnivores were stronger than herbivores.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, the wolf was trembling like a prey that had encountered a top predator.</p>
[You should be thankful just for continuing the lineage of parasites like you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;liverless rabbit&#39; said sarcastically.</p>
[Pig teachers, I told you so. All wolves should be killed. Do you know how many of my compatriots they preyed on?]</p></div>
[I can’t count them.]</p></div>
[You should be grateful if you hired those guys as &#39;villains&#39;. How dare you try to change the original story of a sacred tale?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The wolf constellation did not respond and just shed a sweat. I could see the story of the guy being crushed in real time screaming.</p>
[Some constellations of the nebula &lt;Zodiac&gt; enjoy the suffering of the wolves.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I think revenge for the weak is right. I also believe that the person who was harmed has the right to return what was harmed.</p>
[Story fragment &#39;Hunted Wolf&#39; cries.]</p></div>
[Story fragment &#39;Little Red Riding Hood&#39; cowers in fear.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I had no intention of pointing out whether their ways were correct or not.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But…</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how I looked at it, this stage was somehow distorted.</p>
[Didn’t you promise? You will pay for the crime your brother committed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, a sentence from &#39;Ways of Survival&#39; crossed my mind.</p>
「Animal-shaped constellations often take on the original sin of a race in exchange for sharing that story.」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Some stories go beyond individuals, to species, and even from generation to generation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The wolf constellation hurriedly put down his head and said.</p>
[Well, didn’t we promise to raise a wolf as a tribute this month as well? The wolf will be ready.]</p></div>
[It must be a plump wolf.]</p></div>
[Of course. He gained weight by eating a lot of animal meat—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Fragments of other beastmen&#39;s tales—the wolf harvesters who roamed around collecting &#39;meat&#39; came to mind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A hippopotamus struggling with its arm cut off. The prisoners donating meat but not blaming the wolves.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Is it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did the wolves want &#39;meat&#39;—</p>
[That&#39;s strange. The wolves that have been coming up as tributes recently aren&#39;t that chubby, are they?]</p></div>
[That&#39;s because of the lack of supply of stories in Zone 13... There are not enough recent local story fragments. If we no longer exploit prisoners—]</p></div>
[Should I take your situation into consideration?]</p></div>
[No! I was wrong. I will offer up a wolf that has somehow grown fat, a wolf that has been fed a lot of story fragments, as an offering!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Only then did I begin to understand many things.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason why the story fragments of the prisoners here were all a mess.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason why the arms and legs of prisoners were replaced with machines.</p>
[We have already been patient enough.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Just as the constellations of &lt;Olympus&gt; used giants as their sacrifices, the pigs of &lt;Zodiac&gt; exploited other beastmen at the Recycling Center and received &#39;wolves&#39; as tribute every month.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just to continue their legacy.</p>
[The story &#39;The Three Little Pigs&#39; is complaining about hunger.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The pig-headed symbol slowly descended to the ground and slowly looked around at the wolf incarnations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment one of the wolf incarnations screamed and tried to run away, its head exploded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The pig head laughed, chewing on the head wearing the wolf mask.</p>
[He’s a guy who doesn’t even have anything to eat. I don’t even have enough soup to cook.]</p></div>
[Sorry!]</p></div>
[Can’t you hear the story’s voice? The story wants a sacrifice. Are you hoping that its existence will be erased from the &lt;Star Stream&gt;?]</p></div>
[Please give me one more chance. I will do well!]</p></div>
[Then.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Pig Constellation said.</p>
[Prove it.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He felt the fur on his arms rise. The sound of a story’s song reached my ears. The staging was starting again.</p>
[Offer tribute.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The wolf looked up at the pig&#39;s head with trembling eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Pig Constellation continued to speak.</p>
[Reveal your ugly nature and die.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the pig&#39;s command, the wolf constellation slowly stood up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ye Hyunwoo said while holding my sleeve.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;We need to get into the house.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyung Sein was the same.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Inho-ssi! It’s none of our business. Run away. Quickly. If you don’t run now—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The prisoners who were prostrated hung their heads and trembled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Oh, no! Please forgive the wolf! Forgive him!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Please, great &lt;Zodiac&gt;—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Red Riding Hood’s wolf looked back at them. He saw prisoners with missing limbs and fragments of their stories that had lost their speech.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And he said.</p>
[All right. I will be the &#39;tribute&#39;.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">From the beginning, this was a story with a fixed end. A story that everyone can watch with confidence. There is a set protagonist, and the stage ends only when the set villain dies.</p>
[「Staging」 resumes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">An ominous aura began to flow from the entire body of the wolf constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That wasn&#39;t all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Our brick house was growing.</p>
[The influence of the story fragment &#39;Brick House&#39; becomes stronger!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A brick house that looks as if it can withstand any wolf attack, reminiscent of Gong Pildu&#39;s [Armed Fortress].</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Ah, ah, it was all wrong—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Everyone run away!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The frightened prisoners began to run away one by one into the brick house.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;pig that died first&#39;, who was watching with satisfaction, looked back at me for the last time.</p>
[The one who is favored by monkeys. You found the right answer. Our story will become even greater with the &#39;brick&#39; you found.]</p></div>
[Don’t even think about interfering. If you successfully complete the story, you will also receive a reward.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With those last words, the constellations ascended back to heaven.</p>
[Some constellations in the nebula &lt;Zodiac&gt; want the destruction of the wolves.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The muscles of the wolf constellation began to twitch. It was a sign that the power of 「staging」 was about to dominate his entire body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Stop!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I shouted at the guy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But my words didn&#39;t reach him. A fierce wind was already blowing throughout the entire body of the Wolf Constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk, who was standing next to me, took a step forward and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you planning to change the story?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Pig? It’s just like the Chinese Zodiac guys say. If you stay like this, you can get a new story.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know. But if that happens, the remaining incarnations in this area will—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;You must have felt it from the beginning: the &#39;beasts&#39; here wanted us to become the wolves’ victims.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I know. So, the crane owner guided us to an old &#39;guest house&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The wolves here exploit these beastmen to obtain fragments of stories. They feed them to one of the wolves and offer them as an &#39;sacrifice&#39; to the pigs.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;…&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Whether the beastmen or the wolves die is none of your business.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That too. But—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This world calls that hypocrisy.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I laughed bitterly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;This world looks a lot like a place I used to know.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was sweet, but definitely different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The &#39;demon world&#39; I knew was not like this. Good and evil were a little more clear than this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe this is also a result of &#39;recycling&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I don’t have any particular cause. I just—&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">What would Kim Dokja do?</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I just don’t like this story.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn&#39;t even think I could persuade him. However,</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If you oppose the Chinese zodiac, you will die.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I hesitated for a moment and asked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you really worried about me?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;If it takes just a moment, you can break through.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Little Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s small fists were filled with unusual magical energy.</p>
[Baekbo Shinwon.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was impossible. Because [skills] cannot be used in this worldview. Even when he became a kid, Yoo Jonghyuk is still Yoo Jonghyuk?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The guy created his skill [100 Steps Divine Fist] purely through his own talent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Please.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Jonghyuk&#39;s fist punched into the air. In an instant, an explosive vortex surrounded the wolf, creating a wound in the wind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I dug into the gap and grabbed the wolf constellation by the shoulder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I told you to stop!&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">My voice was scattered in the harsh wind. To the point where communication is barely possible. At this rate, outside constellations will not be able to hear our voices.</p>
[The house… Go in. You… This story… It cannot be changed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was not simply because of 「staging」. The guy&#39;s long Story’s shadow was looming.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Did they cause your Story to make us run away?&quot;</p>
[If you are at home… safe. There… Remember the wolf’s last story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I knew of several constellations where shadows had run away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He will die soon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if he doesn&#39;t die, he will be in the same state as dead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The wolf constellation laughed as if it had read my eyes.</p>
[Me… Are you sympathizing?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Pity? Do you think I’m such an idle person?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">To begin with, the &lt;Star Stream&gt; is a broken world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This world is just a &#39;story&#39;.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All stories sparkle and are consumed by fleeting emotions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Over a long period of history, causes and effects have become mixed, and harm and damage have become indistinguishable.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All that remains is the laughter and cheers of the stars.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though I know that,</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don’t you want to create a new &#39;story’  of wolves?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I can&#39;t give up on the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This is the last story in which he will shine as a constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After hitting that brick house several times, he will fall down the chimney and die a horrible death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And to future generations of wolves, he will be remembered as the new wolf of 「The Three Little Pigs」.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Are you really going to end it like this?&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The wolf constellation&#39;s eyebrows twitched greatly.</p>
[You guy… there’s…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I know what you’re going to say. There’s nothing you can do. You’re going to die anyway. The Zodiac is a nebula you can’t handle.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even though he is a constellation, he is a fallen constellation who has lost all his stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter what he does, he cannot beat the &lt;Zodiac&gt;. It is impossible to destroy the &#39;stage&#39; that has been solidified by the gaze of constellations over hundreds and thousands of years.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But there are things even such a constellation can do.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Sacrifice your Story to summon the God of the Other World.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ruining this stage.</p>
[What… Are you talking nonsense? If you do something like that…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;The existing &#39;stage&#39; will be destroyed. And a new story will begin.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The wolf&#39;s eyes widened as if wondering what I  was talking about.</p>
[Then Zone 13 is—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;Don’t worry. I will stop the God of the Other World&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">The wolf&#39;s voice trembled harshly, as if he belatedly understood what I meant.</p>
[You can’t possibly be—]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">&quot;I plan to steal the story of &#39;The Three Little Pigs&#39;.&quot;</p>
