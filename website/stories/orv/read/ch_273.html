            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 273: Ep. 51 - Giant Story, II</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Surya floated in the air and looked down at the ground with a complicated gaze.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 73rd Demon Realm was surrounded by a bright light as sentences were woven into one being.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the sight of the world choosing its master before the enormous destruction flying from the universe.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surya muttered,</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[It is only the 25th scenario yet a giant story has been obtained… There is such a thing in the Star Stream.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Surya had lived for a long time but he couldn't come up with a name. There was Heracles of Olympus but he was a half-god, not a pure human. King Oedipus exclaimed,</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Surya, it's fine. It is still germinating and you can crush it!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 'giant story' was unlike any other story. It was the sum total of numerous tales and a story that guaranteed a tremendous probability by itself. However, it might be a giant story but it was only beginning. The Demon King of Salvation was just a superficial being who fortunately rose to the status of a constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, why couldn't Surya easily feel confident?</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Surya, what's wrong with you? Let's finish it…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">All giant stories were the 'beginning of the end'. The story that headed towards the end of this epic scenario. Even so, getting a giant story didn't mean that everyone would get the 'qualification of the end'. Some giant stories were connected with ■■ but others didn't go near the vicinity of ■■ before disappearing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Surya, it is because you can't get the qualification of the end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He didn't forget Asmodeus' words. In his tranquil rage, a message entered Surya's ears.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new scenario has been given to you!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You will be the destruction of the 73rd Demon Realm.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Surya frowned at the undesirable role assignment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'The Star Stream. What do you want from this old body?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">He lost one of his 12 suns to Cheok Jungyeong and wasted a great deal of energy against Asmodeus. In addition, he had exhausted most of the probability given to him.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Surya. You don't have to go by the book. I have an idea. There is a way to subdue them without fighting.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Surya frowned.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Oedipus. Are you going to use a despicable trick again? Against humans?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[T-That isn't it…]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I am the Supreme God of Light, Surya.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The great sentences of Vedas were shining in Surya's halo.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Even if I can't use my full strength, I will never lose to humans.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Oedipus shut his mouth in front of the overwhelming 'status'. Surya raised his hand and the paused carriage started the violent charge again.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The locomotive made a deafening sound as it crashed through the atmosphere. Red and blue flames sparked from the head. The first one to speak was Yoo Joonghyuk. "It doesn't seem like 135,000 kilometres."</p>
<p class="orv_line">If a train of that size really appeared, it would seem like a giant planet was falling. Cheok Jungyeong told me,</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[His words are correct. It is around 30 kilometers long. Still, that is enough to destroy this place. Demon King of Salvation, what happened to the giant story?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"It has just started talking. The sentences are slow to gather."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The giant story of the 73rd Demon Realm was safely obtained but things weren't over just by receiving it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It needs more time to work properly. We have to slow down the train."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps this 'train' was all that the present Surya could mobilize. There was a chance for us if we managed to block that train. I looked back and saw Cheok Jungyeong already prepared to jump forward. "Please, Goryeo's First Sword."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Believe in me.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Cheok Jungyeong shot forward towards the sky. Yoo Joonghyuk and I chased after him and the rest of the group followed on Shin Yoosung's chimera dragon. The Thunder Eating Bird and Mysterious Bird of the Nile flew to interfere with us but the Brash Swamp Predator bit at their wings.</p>

<div class="orv_notice"><p>* Official novel illustration (canonical)</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Leave these guys to me!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The closer we got to the head of the train, the more I realized the enormous scale of Vedas. The width of the head of the train was a few hundreds metres and it was at the level of an outer god.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Haaaaaap!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Cheok Jungyeong shouted and showed his Three Sword Style.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Two Swords Style, Two Sword Mountain Chop.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Cheok Jungyeong's slash that cut through a mountain hit the train. The head of the train met Cheok Jungyeong's status and let out a strange sound. It deviated from its course but the speed of the train didn't slow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the formidable heat, it was Cheok Jungyeong's sword slash that was melted away. However, Cheok Jungyeong didn't stop.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Three Swords Style, Three Sword Ocean Chop.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A strike that cut the sea. It felt like there was a tsunami and the speed of the train was reduced to a slight degree. The biggest achievement was the explosion to the lead car, creating an internal access point.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[It will be easier to move inside! I will slow it down from outside!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Cheok Jungyeong emitted a strong magic power from the head of the train. Still, it was hard for Cheok Jungyeong to deal with an object of this speed alone. "I'll help you ahjussi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosung's chimera dragon moved to the head of the train with Cheok Jungyeong. The second-grade monster, the chimera dragon created intense wind pressure and the speed of the train was further reduced. Cheok Jungyeong cried out,</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I have somehow bought 20 minutes. Surya will be in the car at the end. Knock him down and this story will disappear! Go!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">We nodded and entered the interior of the train. The train looked like a subway built for a giant. We adapted to the inertia to a certain extent and pressed the button to go to the next compartment of the train.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The door won't open.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This train is only available to the constellations of Vedas.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk didn't hesitate to activate the Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship and hit the door. There was a dent in the door but it didn't open.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…Amazing'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unlike Cheok Jungyeong's expectations, the train's internal strength was formidable. It wouldn't be hard to break if Yoo Joonghyuk and I were in good shape but the train was 30 kilometers long. In other words, we had to consider the distribution of power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then the first sentence of the giant story was heard.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The story started on the subway. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Sparks surged and my stories were released into the air. I felt waves surging from a distant place. It was the sign of a very old story. I looked back and the party members seemed to be feeling something similar.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The first story of your 'giant story' has begun.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk, Lee Hyunsung and Yoo Sangah looked at me. The sparks that flowed like the tide was transforming the scenery around us. Lee Hyunsung murmured with astonishment, "T-This…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Every giant story was a different story. Some involved the birth of a hero while others told the birth of a world. Our story wasn't a hero's biography or a creation story. This story was our survival record.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The number '3807' was on the back door of the train. I looked around and sighed. "…It is the subway."</p>
<p class="orv_line">All stories invoked Stage Transformation when the place or person involved in the story collided.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–The 3807 car of the 3434 Bulgwang train.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was where Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung became my colleagues and where I met Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">All of our stories started here. Lee Hyunsung's fists were clenched as he opened his mouth with a tense expression. "I remember that time."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It isn't a good memory but…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah was watching me with a faint smile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Even so, I often think about it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't a memory I could happily recall. Someone's death and the hell of an absurd scenario. It wasn't a memory I could feel nostalgic about but it was a history that we survived. Lee Hyunsung smiled and placed his hand on the door. "I think I can do it somehow."</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 There was a soldier who wanted to be righteous. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Eventually, everything became a story. It was hard, sad and even something I wanted to forget. After all, everything was a story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Haaaaaap!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't expect it would be comforting for us now. There was only one thing we could know.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is watching your party.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is listening to your story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In a world where sadness and joy were useless, we had to continue the story. The door, which didn't open to Yoo Joonghyuk's Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship, started to open at Lee Hyunsung's power. The giant story dwelling in Lee Hyunsung's body started exerting its strength.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has used the stigma 'Great Mountain Push Lv. 10'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When I thought about it, Lee Hyunsung was the one who opened the door to escape.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Go. Quickly!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung opened the gap and our party ran. Nevertheless, it was only one door and the train was still long. This time, it was Yoo Joonghyuk who came forward.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will break through next."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I suddenly remembered a long time ago. The regressor who annihilated the other incarnations on the train and rushed forward like a tank was now in front of me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 There was the strongest and loneliest man in the world. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk put away his sword and concentrated all his magic power on his fist. Then he slammed his bare fist into the door. The door of the car, which was unharmed before the sword, was torn apart by his bare hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was the effect of Stage Transformation. It was unfortunate for Surya that his main story was this 'train'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Dokja-ssi! I don't think we need to break this car!" Yoo Sangah figured something out and yelled. Just like when I found the opening device, Yoo Sangah found a way to open the car door without force.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 There was also a woman who hid herself for others. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">One car, another car. We kept moving forward. It was as if we were living history again. There was the sound of hammering from the outside of the train. Lee Jihye was also struggling to reduce the speed of the train.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The sword demon wounded after losing a friend was met. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The chimera dragon's roar was heard. In my arms, Biyoo raised her head and looked at the head of the train. To be exact, it was in Shin Yoosung's direction.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 A child born in the gap between past and future wept. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The next moment, the chimera dragon let out a formidable roar. The train tilted and the speed of the train was further reduced. I didn't know but I thought Biyoo might've given something to Shin Yoosung here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We aren't halfway yet. We have to hurry."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As Yoo Joonghyuk stated, we were still far away from the end of the train. More than 10 minutes had already passed. The speed might be reduced but the industrial complex would be completely destroyed at this pace. To make matters worse, we faced a challenge when we reached the next car.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A ray of light shot towards us. Lee Hyunsung blocked it for me and held his shoulder.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You can't go any further.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'Founder of Humanity' Manu and several other constellations were waiting there. Yoo Joonghyuk directly used Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship against them but it wasn't enough to break through the constellations on the defense. They knew they had to drag out time here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was going to use the magic power I had saved when the ceiling of the train started to be squeezed. Something was destroying the train with an immense magic power from outside.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[W-What… what's going on?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was at least a narrative-grade constellation. They couldn't destroy the shell of the train unless they had the power to match Cheok Jungyeong.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Mooooove!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then Jang Hayoung's voice was heard outside the train. "Kim Dokja! They came! They came!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The next moment, the entire ceiling was torn off and two beings appeared with Jang Hayoung.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation of a small planet is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a small person filled with a brilliant blue-white energy and a huge woman releasing a blue aura. Funnily enough, my vision seemed to blur for a moment. "Where is my disciple?"</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 There was the strongest small person in the world as a teacher. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"It seems that we're a bit late."</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The world of the strongest giant was saved. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">They were existences with enough power as Cheok Jungyeong who could help us.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Transcendents…!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In front of Manu, the two transcendents of First Murim descended. The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, Namgung Minyoung. The Paradox Baekchung, Kyrgios Rodgraim.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Namgung Minyoung glanced at us and said, "Do it properly until the end. Otherwise, I'll kick your ass."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyrgios stared at me and declared, "You will pay the price for lying to me. I won't allow your death until then."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kyrgios and the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint fired their skills at the door to the next car. The energy of Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship and Electrification combined and caused a formidable wind pressure to rise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations shrank back at their momentum. The fearsome waves of magic power advanced and crushed the doors blocking our way. It was a straight road prepared for a short period of time. Yoo Joonghyuk met my gaze and we started running.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Way of the Wind Lv. 11 (+1) is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Way of the Wind and Red Phoenix Shunpo assisted each other as we ran. We soon reached the last car of the train.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Finally, there was a man who knew the ending of all these worlds. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This story didn't exist in Ways of Survival. It was a story that never existed before. It was a story that would lead me to the ending I wanted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened the last door of the train.</p>
