            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 241: Ep. 45 - Gourmet Association, V</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Iris was confused.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Originally, she was supposed to sign a contract with a constellation of Asgard. It was a lesser-grade constellation that wasn't well-known and Iris didn't like the contract. That's why she participated in the Bracelet Expedition hosted by Anna Croft. Anna said that if Iris showed a great performance here, Anna could change her intended sponsor.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now in this unexpected place, a chance came to Iris.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' wants to establish a 'Sponsor Contract' with you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Thinking about it, there was no way constellations could only contract with one incarnation. Some constellations had two or three depending on their capacity. Of course, the power of the constellation was divided so the incarnations received weakened stigmas.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even so, Iris wasn't in a position to regret something like this. "I accept!"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' states that this contract is only for a limited time.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' states that this contract is valid until the end of the Bracelet Expedition.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Temporary contract…</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Yes, now isn't the time to be greedy'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Iris bit her lips and nodded. By the way, the words of the constellation weren't finished.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says there is a condition.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' wants the 'wish' to be transferred to him after the scenario is completed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Iris' mind was complicated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…It was a temporary contract and he wanted the wish? A strange regret passed over her but she wasn't in a position to pass up this chance. The Demon King of Salvation's condition was based on completing the scenario. It meant he would keep her alive, no matter what happened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll definitely give it to you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, a holographic contract descended in the air. Iris ran over and signed the hologram.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Sponsor Contract has been completed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Power flowed into her body and she felt that someone was supporting her. She felt confident that she could do anything. However, Iris' confidence quickly disappeared at the cries from behind her.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The incarnation hunting has begun.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There were screams as incarnations were torn apart by evil spirits.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Current number of expedition members remaining: 6 people]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the original novel, this game was called 'Hunting and Chasting'. This wasn't a Gourmet Association event, it was an event hosted by Anna Croft. In this round, Anna Croft decided to skip the process and start from the Gourmet Association.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I continued to mutter towards the air and the Mass Production Maker asked me, [Hoh, you participated?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…Did you participate?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Huhu, I'm too old to run to scenarios like that. And… it doesn't suit my tastes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, not all members of the Gourmet Association were enthusiastic about this scenario. On one side, there were the constellations who disliked Anna Croft. On another side, there were the constellations who disliked the event itself.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Hmm. I don't see your modifier on the list of evil spirits…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There were 15 constellations who participated in the scenario. However, the number of constellations who chose the role of the evil spirit was only 14. I nodded and the eyes of the Mass Production Maker slowly widened.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Indeed, there was a reason the old hag Persephone brought you here. But is it okay? You are here for the first time…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I replied with a smile. "The more brilliant my debut, the better."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then the system message arrived like it had been waiting.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Gourmet Association Heretic' has been acquired.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe Anna Croft would be listening to messages similar to mine.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 There is always a story in a place where many constellations gather. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This was the first principle of generating a story. The level of the story was determined by combining the risk to the story subject and the form of the story. Anna Croft was currently an 'incarnation' and she was walking a tightrope. If her scenario was successfully completed, it might be a legendary story such as 'Follower of the First Generation' or 'Story Manipulator'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I closed my eyes and saw what was happening with Iris.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at his incarnation.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt sorry when I saw her shaking shoulders but I didn't have any good memories for this child. I wasn't good enough to show kindness to her. That's why this was just a gesture for 'trading'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says to stay calm.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Iris gulped and replied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–I don't know if I can do it.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says there is no hopeless scenario.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">All scenarios had holes to escape out of. The hole was small and tiny so it was highly difficult to clear on the first try. This meant there was a chance to clear it after trying a few times and I was a person who knew more about this world than anyone else.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sound of the evil spirits moving could be heard in the distance. Iris' physique was at the limit and the only stigma I could pass on was Sacrifice's Will. Dammit, that stigma wouldn't help in the current situation. However, stigmas weren't the only things that constellations could give.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is giving his incarnation the 'Assassination King's Cloak.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Iris was surprised to see the gift that emerged in the air. It was an item I bought for 150,000 coins from the Dokkaebi Bag. It had a usage limit of 30 minutes a day and lacked the ability to deceive the constellations, but the current situation was different.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…Here?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations emerged from the grass as if they were waiting. The constellations that became evil spirits looked different. There were a giant horned demon and a spirit with a bull's head holding a small scythe. The only thing they had in common was that they had no feet and were shrouded in a black cloak.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Hmm, strange. It was definitely around here.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Did you see it properly?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Iris disappeared and the constellations who were evil spirits couldn't discover her traces at all. The constellations who played the role of evil spirits were under strong restrictions. The constellations in the role of the evil spirit could only one-tenth of their current 'status'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For the constellations, a game wasn't fun if it was too easy. Just as there were no humans who would rejoice in stepping on 15 bugs. They didn't hesitate to impose constraints on themselves for entertainment. This was the constellations of the Gourmet Association.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[It seems she must've done something. Let her run a bit more. The scenario should be stacked up to taste better.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…Huhu, I'm looking forward to it.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations searching the grass soon gave up and Iris received a system message.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[The expedition member Iris Vladimirovna Rebezova has survived an evil spirit once.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Bracelet Expedition' has accumulated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This scenario was made up of classic stories. The longer Iris stayed in the scenario, the more the energy of the classic story would permeate her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–I-I lived!</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says you were lucky this time.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If these guys were high-ranking constellations, it would've been impossible to hide from them using the Assassination King's Cloak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, just like Persephone and the Mass Production Maker, the really high-ranking Gourmet Association constellations wouldn't run like dogs towards this scenario. It was also interesting to watch other constellations vent their desires in this event. In other words, they were the real audience I should aim for.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Thank you for the gift.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says it is a loan.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">–…Yes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is sympathetic to your incarnation.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' reproaches your harshness.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The scenario would start from now on.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">As the number of expedition members continued to decrease, Iris moved towards the volcano while avoiding the eyes of the constellations. She also had the good luck of collecting the bracelet from the expedition members that died along the way.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Current number of expedition members remaining: 2 people]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was natural since I was participating in the scenario while reading Ways of Survival in real-time. It was because Ways of Survival contained a very detailed account of the Evil Blight Bracelet, the prototype of this scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I analyzed the terrain using the scenario map and moved Iris along the most efficient path towards the volcano.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Haha, this is a fun story. Wasn't there a lot of delicious food? I'm drooling…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The other constellations seemed to notice that someone was involved on the 'expedition' side. Nevertheless, none of them were panicked.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The expedition member 'Merves Lutier' has died!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Shortly afterwards, Iris was alone.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…It smells delicious.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The scattered evil spirits were gathering near the volcano. They knew that the last expedition member had to come to the volcano. Now the time of the Assassination King's Cloak was almost up. I gave a signal to Iris.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says to do it now.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Iris started running towards the volcano. I stared at the back of the running girl. All the constellations of the Gourmet Association were watching the little girl running with all her might.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps, everyone knew. This girl, she had no choice but to die here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was 100 steps away from the volcano when the privilege of the Assassination King's Cloak finally ended. The 10 evil spirits wandering around instantly gathered.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I will eat first!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Iris watched the incoming evil spirits and backed away with terror. Her last desperate gaze was towards the sky.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is asking to lend him your incarnation body.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Iris gasped as her mouth opened.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says it isn't an 'advent'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If I manifested in the form of an 'advent', I would also be constrained by the scenario. Thus, I wouldn't do it as an 'advent' this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had a skill that was more efficient and consumed less probability. I deliberately pulled out a few stories that made up my incarnation body in order to deal myself a serious blow.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 3 has been activated!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 1st person supporting role viewpoint has been activated.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your understanding of 'Iris Vladimirovna Rebezova' has increased!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my eyes to Iris' point of view. Maybe my body in the Gourmet Association was currently sleeping. Thus, I had to end this game in the shortest amount of time.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some constellations have noticed your presence!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the same time, there was an outpouring of true voices towards me.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[There was someone helping her. Who are you?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Hoh, is it an advent?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[This windfall…!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Iris received the accumulated stories and her body shone golden. I laughed bitterly as I looked down at myself.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One way for a newcomer in the Gourmet Association was to grow step by step. However, if I dragged it on like that, I might not be able to reach the end of the story after 3,000 chapters.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Did that Anna girl plan something? The person I just killed was a sword master.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">One constellation walking in the distance spoke as he threw the incarnation in his hands. Perhaps he was the last expedition member to die.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You look like a new recruit. It is best for you to leave this place. Or else your body will suffer a great blow.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The head of the dead expedition member rolled towards me. It was the head of the incarnation who fled to the end but eventually didn't survive. I carefully picked up the head and one of the constellations sneered.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Do you pity him? Huhu… this guy doesn't know art.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Why should their lives be your art?" I stroked his head and the memories of the dead incarnation flowed in. The memories soon became a story that dwelt at my fingertips.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A fragment of the story 'Grudge of a Brutally Murdered Sword Master' has been acquired.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations drew back with a frown.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…You like dirty stories.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Dirty? You gave it to me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Why did this person easily become a sword master? It was simple. He originally received it from a constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The story is boring. The scenario is too slow. It is the power that all of you gave them."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The things that were received gathered. Someone became a sword master. Someone became a great magician. Then the sword master and great magician became the sin. They all became the prey of these beings.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What are you trying to do? Stop eating!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A hot-tempered constellation raised the power of the evil spirit. Originally, Iris couldn't defeat them. The expedition could never win against the evil spirits. However—</p>
<p class="orv_line">The evil spirit screamed and retreated from the burning sword.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Kuaaaack!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In my hand was the sword I had purchased along with the Assassination King's Cloak.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<h3 class="orv_window_title">[Item Information]</h3>
<p>Name: Eoren's Sword - Replica</p>
<p>Rating: SS+ (Specific scenarios only)</p>
<p>Description: A sword energized by a first generation story. Only female incarnations can use it and it can generate a force that resists evil spirits for 10 minutes.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a sword that cost 200,000 coins. It was also a sword that was useless apart from in this scenario. Normally it was an item I would never buy.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…A first generation sword?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Hey, don't be scared! It's just a replica version!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, I was really worried about it.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many constellations are astonished by your actions!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I had wondered if it was worth taking this risk for this scenario. I measured what I could get from it.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some members of the Gourmet Association are showing a strong hostility to you!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Some things should be calculated and some shouldn't. Then I made a choice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You knew I would come to the volcano." I decided not to calculate things. "Then did you know? I also knew you would be gathering here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter what penalties were received or if the opponents were constellations. I couldn't afford to pay attention to it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, I smiled like always. "Let's start the real hunting."</p>
