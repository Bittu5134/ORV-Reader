            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 503: Ep. 96 - Demon-like Judge of Fire, III</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Final Dragon of Revelation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The great calamity that decides the end of 'Great War of Saints and Demons' as well as the most horrifying apocalypse of <Star Stream> itself.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The ⸢Stage Transformation⸥'s degree of reproduction has exceeded the percentage limit!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The lightning bolts powerfully tearing through the storm clouds now took on a different hue than before. Both <Asgard>'s Odin and <Papyrus>'s Osiris jaws dropped in sheer astonishment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Black Flame Dragon!!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Apocalypse Dragon's gaze lingered on Han Sooyoung's face for the briefest moment in time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢It's possible that Uriel isn't the only Constellation different from the original.⸥</p>
<p class="orv_line">Back in the original novel, this guy was the Constellation backer of the 'Delusion Demon' Kim Namwoon. He was the leader of evil dragons that represented the 'Absolute Evil', not to mention the ruler of the Nebula <Black Cloud>.</p>
<p class="orv_line">He raised his head high up to the sky and cried out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The entirety of <Star Stream> shuddered from the screech that announced the arrival of this world's final pages.</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon's' ■■ is 'Something that can't be found'.]⸥</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had read what his ■■ was from the original novel. His description showed up when he became Yoo Joonghyuk's ally for a little while during the 1863rd turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢The evil dragon suffering from the worst possible depression in this <Star Stream>.⸥</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason why the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' believed his age to be 15 was simply that he'd not be able to continue on if he didn't.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A life stretching for thousands, no, tens of thousands of years, made an originally solitary dragon into such a creature.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order to stop itself from decaying, he chose not to age. He chose not to lose his curiosity of the world. He chose to torment Incarnations or play bizarre pranks. And for his final prank, he even chose to betray the 'Absolute Evil', too. He stood on Yoo Joonghyuk's side and while mocking the <Star Stream>, breathed his last.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', has reached his ■■!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">What about this world-line, though?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did he finally manage to find his ■■ within this empty universe?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon's' ■■ is 'Pureness'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' looked at me and smiled.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His child-like eyes were now dyeing the world in the night of apocalypse as if he was satisfied by the role he had found.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Fully-satisfied Probability has recreated the 'Apocalypse Dragon' in the Final Scenario!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', has achieved perfect unity with the scenario!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Myth-grade Constellations began roaring at the top of their lungs at the reproduction of Apocalypse Dragon.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[This is impossible…!!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Every Constellation alive was well aware of the Story of Apocalypse Dragon, the great calamity capable of destroying a section of <Star Stream> with nothing but its 'First Tail-flick'.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Stop him! Kill him before the tail-flick commences!!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The clearly-freaking out Myth-grade Constellations ungainly lost their composure and issued their orders.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung, Yoo Joonghyuk and I all looked up at that spectacle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢None among these Myth-grade Constellations have experienced the 'Apocalypse Dragon' before. Because their peers that did fight it had all perished back then.⸥</p>
<p class="orv_line">After all, these bastards had been hiding inside this 'ark', the safest place in the entire world, and watched the moment of the Apocalypse Dragon being unshackled as if it was a form of entertainment. In other words, they had absolutely no clue what this fear was like, the terror, and what it meant to risk their lives.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk next to me asked a question. "You… You have been preparing for this moment all along, haven't you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly nodded my head. "That's right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">From the moment the first scenario began, I had been calculating a certain something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢Just how much Story would I need to compile in order to massacre the Constellations in the Final Scenario?⸥</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't get to an answer. A human's lifespan was short, but stars were eternal. Since our starting lines were different, the battle would never be fair, and most important of all, I wasn't a regressor like Yoo Joonghyuk. I couldn't live a life of 1863 regression turns and fight them afterwards.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It was wrong to even think about compiling Stories to fight them. Whether it's a legendary or mythical Story, you can't suppress those beings in terms of pure Status no matter how many Stories you manage to amass."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"And so, this is what you came up with."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded my head and stared at Kim Yoo-Shin and Gyebaek fighting together with [Shindansu] behind them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢Kim Dokja found the answer to this battle within the 'Stage Transformation'.⸥</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ⸢Stage Transformation⸥; although it was imaginary, this power would grow closer to reality as Probability expanded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I confirmed the potential of this power when defeating Surya back in the 'Demon King Selection' battles, and the first outlines of my plan formed in my head when we defeated <Olympus> back in the 'Gigantomachia'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And I grew even more confident after we experienced the 'Great War of Saints and Demons', then won the 'Journey to the West'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢The more they succeeded in the impossible-odds scenarios, the greater the power of reproduction their 'Giant Story' possessed.⸥</p>
<p class="orv_line">The air they breathed, the emotions they felt on that day – the fear humans felt while facing the apocalypse, their eyes fixed to the outpouring of the stars.</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢And now, it was the turn of the Constellations to feel the fear people felt on that day.⸥</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', is continuing on with its storytelling!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Apocalypse Dragon's 'First Tail-flick' commenced.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kwa-kwakwakwakwakwa!!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Apocalypse Dragon's tail-flick was divided into three separate shockwaves. The first was 'electrical wave', the second was 'heat wave', while the true tail-flick and the third wave was the 'wave of Chaos'.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Kuwaaaaah---! I shall block this!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Thor, who had defended against the electrical wave with me back then, stepped forward. He must've felt confident this time too, since he had dealt with it in the past.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Unfortunately, that was a terrible misjudgement on his part.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Thor-!!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Thor's scorched-black figure crash-landed from the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The reason why he could defend against the electrical wave back then was because Dionysus, me, and my master were there to aid him. However, no one was helping him out this time.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Uwaaaaah-!!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Just as the fear-stricken Constellations turned around to run, all the Myth-grade Constellations unleashed their Statuses. Along with the incredible storm of aftermaths, all the stars in the sky flickered unsteadily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">And then, the exploding electrical wave blanketed entire surroundings like fine fog particles.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Once the view cleared out, one could clearly see that the Apocalypse Dragon's electrical wave had been weakened by a great deal.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…And it only amounted to this much?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Tsu-chuchuchut…!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The one who defended against the electrical wave was the leader of <Asgard>, Odin. His dignified beard, which was his pride and joy, was scorched black. His clothing had all melted down, too, leaving him buck-naked. He revealed his skin, horrifyingly deformed by that wave, and laughed out loudly.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[With such measly little…!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Shu-susususut…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Right in the next moment, <Asgard>'s Constellations manning his side began scattering away like dust. Their lives were exhausted completely while dealing with the Probability necessary to offset the shockwave.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Odin's eye grew large from shock. Grey-coloured powder spread about helplessly in the air. With that one attack alone, half of <Asgard> was wiped out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ku-oooooooh!!</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a similar situation with <Vedas> and <Papyrus> as well.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…Nuwa!!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Osiris belatedly understood the severity of this situation and looked behind while shouting that name out. That was where he discovered Nuwa leading the forces of <Emperor> to withdraw from this cabin. She had recognised the unfavourable battle situation and prepared to retreat from very early on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Gong Pildu."</p>
<p class="orv_line">After I called out, Gong Pildu's castle moved. His [Armed Fortress] accurately blocked off the path leading to the Emperor's worldview, and its turrets began spitting out flames.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You're going nowhere."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At same time, the Apocalypse Dragon's second shockwave exploded out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The flames of the 'heat wave' boiling over from the deepest part in hell began melting down the Constellations in the air.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Bureau!! How long are you going to sit back and watch?!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Odin's scream prompted the Great Dokkaebi Garang to raise its hand while Story endlessly gurgled out from its mouth.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[…Fine. If you wish to use the 'Stage Transformation', then…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, I felt this ominous foreboding.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tsu-chuchuchu…!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ⸢Stage Transformation⸥'s authority was now in full display. A powerful deluge of sparks caused me to hurriedly look behind, only to discover blood trickling out from Yoo Sangah's lips.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sangah-ssi!!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The lotus pedestal spinning next to her suddenly developed cracks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">She vomited out a chunk of blood and spoke in an ashamed voice. "I stopped one… from coming out, but… a portion of the other has…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were two great beings sealed away in the 'Isle of Reincarnators' by Sakyamuni. One of them was the Apocalypse Dragon, while the other was…</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Wall that decides Samsara' is violently writhing around!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Wall that decides Samsara' is unveiling its theme!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Existence from another world is breaking past the 'Wall's' seal and has been recreated in this world!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Tsu-chuchuchut!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Black fog was distorting the heavens as it rushed in here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Countless eyes could be seen beyond that dark fog. It was <Star Stream>'s cleaner, the one that should've been imprisoned within the eternal darkness after Sakyamuni had sealed it away.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[■■■■■■■■! Oh, the 'Indescribable Distance'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I realized what the Dokkaebis were trying to do. They were trying to use the same method I used back in the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' to stop the Apocalypse Dragon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢And so, the two calamities representing the absolute worst-case scenario of <Star Stream> collided.⸥</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Haha, hahaha! You shall never reach the final verse! You shall never-!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With those final parting words, the heads of all the Great Dokkaebis exploded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 'Indescribable Distance' sucked in their Stories and violently writhed. And then, this Outer God that had earned the Great Dokkaebis' Stories, and the Black Flame Dragon that earned the power of apocalypse, glared at each other.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Third shockwave is now commencing!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Apocalypse Dragon's tail moved. The calamity moved very slowly, its speed very measured but assured.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nuwa grew impatient and yelled out loudly in the air.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Just what are you all doing?! Fu Xi! Shennong! All of you damnable Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, just for how long are you planning to enjoy the slumber of abyss?!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Ku-gugugugu!!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nuwa's true voice managed to wake up the <Emperor>'s ancient Constellations. The blessings from the Myth-grade Constellations that hadn't shown themselves until now completely enveloped Nuwa's Incarnation Body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The truly explosive rise in her Status forced Going Pildu's [Armed Fortress] back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We needed to stop her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We couldn't afford to let them escape back to their own worldview.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Giant Story, 'Journey to the West', has begun its storytelling!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Nebula <Emperor>'s Giant Story began its story; Nuwa transformed into a gigantic Imoogi and her flames began amassing within her maw.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just before the <Emperor>'s Constellations gathered their fighting spirit and rushed towards us…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kurururung! Rumble!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lightning bolts struck down from the sky and Nuwa screamed loudly.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Giant Story, 'Liberator of Forgotten Ones', has begun its storytelling!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sight of Tongtian spread out in an instant, and an existence draped in the golden tiger hide defended me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kwa-kwakwakwakwa…</p>
<p class="orv_line">He was the sole existence capable of standing up against the <Emperor>'s vast Myth-grade Constellations.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellation, 'Most Ancient Liberator', has incarnated into the 'Final Ark'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He was also a star that became my brother.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Meihouwang' is looking at you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Bimawen' is looking at you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Douzhanshengfo' is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">All of the Sun Wukongs addressed me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Great Sage, Heaven's Equal' is turning his back to you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Go now, maknae-yah.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">We could see the Apocalypse Dragon's tail colliding against the Indescribable Distance in the distant sky. We all knew very well the likely outcome of that collision.</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢He dreamed of every star's destruction. But, did he really wish for such a result?⸥</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had never forgotten the final moment of the 1863rd regression turn.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Great Sage turned around and rushed towards the <Emperor>'s Constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even before I could reach out, Yoo Joonghyuk and Han Sooyoung grabbed me and ran away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu continued to shout something or rather, while Lee Seolhwa was pulling out all the recovery medicines in her possession. I couldn't tell whether Lee Hyunsung's forged steel covered us first, or the pure-white flash of light managed to blanket the world before that. It felt like my whole body was melting down from the incredible heat, only to become deathly cold as if I was exposed to a cold snap.</p>
<p class="orv_line">When I came to, we were already cast outside the cabin.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Stories leaked out indiscriminately from the gaps of the crumbling walls, painfully singing the end of the stars.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The prop storage's door hadn't been closed yet. Ash drifted out through the half-open doorway.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['The Fourth Wall' is violently trembling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe, somehow, everyone inside that cabin was…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shu-sut…</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a faint presence of someone beyond it, and Han Sooyoung's voice entered my ears almost at the same time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…Kim Dokja?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I crawled towards the door. My heart didn't want to stop pounding away. I barely managed to reach the rim of the doorway, and saw someone standing there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢Torn white feathers were cascading downwards one by one.⸥</p>
<div class="orv_image"><img src="../../../assets/images/503 - Torn white feathers were cascading downwards one by one.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></div>
<p class="orv_line">*</p>
<div class="orv_notice"><p>* Official novel illustration (canonical)</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My lips bobbed up and down. I wanted to say something.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But in place of my mouth wanting to open, Uriel slowly bent down first.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…Dokja…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't hear her true voice properly. I tried so hard to get back up as Uriel reached out to me. And her white hand brushed past my face as if she was stroking my cheek and brows.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I saw the enemy Constellations standing back up from beyond Uriel's broken wings. Some stars somehow managed to survive even from this utterly horrifying calamity.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Stage Transformation' has concluded.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I could no longer sense the Status of the 'Indescribable Distance'. I then saw the huge body of the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' now lying unmoving on the floor – and the Constellations from the Great Nebulas pouncing on top of him, as well as demons tearing into the wings of Archangels.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Countless enemies were approaching Uriel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Urie…!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was about to open the door, grab my sword, and cut them down for Uriel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢However, the door didn't open.⸥</p>
<p class="orv_line">Uriel held fast the doorknob from the other side and didn't let go.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon's cry, as desperate as a real scream, resounded out. "Uriel!! Hurry!! Hurry and get out of there-!!"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[It's okay.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't want to hear what she was about to say next. Uriel smiled at me.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You guys, you've only seen up to this far in the story, that's all.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The cabin's door was closed shut.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have accomplished a feat that no star in <Star Stream> has ever managed to accomplish!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The story beyond the door could no longer be heard. Some of us screamed out, while some despaired. The ark seemed to tilt out of balance, before it crashed against something along with a loud boom. I rolled around on the floor ungainly. The vibration of the ark had already come to a stop by the time I lifted myself up, the wave of vicious dizziness washing over me nonstop.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't have any energy left to even stand. I could only manage to raise my head and look ahead. My eyes followed after the broken partitioning walls to discover a new location.</p>
<p class="orv_line">That unknown something colliding with the ark had become connected to the vessel's interior.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[All the stars in <Star Stream> will never forget you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">None of those stars were looking at us now. But, there was one existence remaining still looking at us.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['King of Stories' is waiting for you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A yellowish mineral-like object rolled down the slope of the destroyed ark. I recognised what that was. That 'gemstone' was what we had been searching for inside this ark all along, after all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, neither me nor my companions had any energy left to focus on that gemstone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I left the ark and slowly scanned our surroundings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We were greeted by a wall so vast that its ends couldn't be seen. Stories leaking out from the ark was permeating into that wall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢And so, Kim Dokja has finally arrived at his destination.⸥</p>
<p class="orv_line">That wall was now talking to me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">⸢The end of all these stories. The 'Final Wall' was right before their eyes.⸥</p>
