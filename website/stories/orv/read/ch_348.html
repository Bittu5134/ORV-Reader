        <article class="orv_main">
            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 348: Ep. 65 - Good and Evil, IV</h1></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Monarch of the Snake Hell is wounded and has exited from the scenario.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have won the demon king promotion!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your Demon Realm ranking is adjusted!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have become the 72nd Demon King!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I passed by Cho Jinchul's ashes and looked around. There were two demon kings who hadn't yet come to their senses. Indeed, it was natural to be surprised. It was because the lowest ranked 72nd demon king was finished in one blow. Even so, this was reality.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Several demon kings are amazed by your power.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The demon king 'Devil of Comfort and Savagery' is spitting at your status.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The demon king 'Darkness of No Value' is threatened by your status.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is mocking the reaction of the demon kings.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Not all constellations received a giant story. Even if they had a giant story, their stakes in it were low and they couldn't take full advantage of it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was different. All my giant stories weren't inherited from someone else but were a history that I created with my party members.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' is continuing.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The giant stories gathered in this way showed a completely different level of power.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is looking at the demon kings with greedy eyes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The confrontation with Poseidon still lingered in Unbroken Faith. I stared at the demon kings.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The demon king 'Thinker of Lies and Secrets' is preparing to depart from the scenario.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 71st demon king, Dantalion. The demon who was known to be cunning noticed quickly.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Where are you trying to run to?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I used both Electrification and Way of the Wind and caught him. This time, I was helped by Bihyung.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The bureau has rejected the scenario proposal of the Thinker of Lies and Secrets.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[The game should be finished to the end, demon kings.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Dantalion's eyes widened like he hadn't expected the dokkaebi to take my side. Was it the shock of Andromalius' defeat? I didn't feel any dignity from the appearance of the demon kings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The demon kings outside the top 70 were like this. They became demon kings out of luck and barely clung to the bottom of the ladder while abusing the title of 'demon king'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Blood rose and the head of a negligent incarnation body rolled to the ground.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[The 71st.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Thinker of Lies and Secrets is wounded and has exited from the scenario.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have won the demon king promotion!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your Demon Realm ranking is adjusted!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have become the 71st Demon King!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at the last remaining one, Performer of Musical Instruments Amdusias.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Amdusias asked, [Do you really have to do this?]</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Why, are you scared?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Do you see me in the same class as Andromalius and Dantalion?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The atmosphere changed. Unlike the two demon kings I had previously defeated, Amdusias was prepared for a fight. The horn of a unicorn grew from the head of the incarnation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The demon king 'Performer of Musical Instruments' has summoned the star relic 'Star Trumpet'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">From the 60s, the level of the demon kings went up a bit.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Reading Comprehension' is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The thickness of the story was different. However, there were no special feelings since I already met the 32nd ranked Asmodeus. Asmodeus might've gone up the ranks a lot by now. There were demon kings who had particularly steep growth and one of them was Asmodeus. On the other hand, the demon kings in the lower rankings rarely had a chance to rise.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your status has increased greatly and your skill 'Reading Comprehension' is strengthened!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your skill allows you to understand the composition of the story!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The story that I felt from Amdusias was very dark and worn out.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Hell Performer' is yawning while looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a boring and long story that no longer made me curious about the backstory. This was the story that formed the backbone of Amdusias, Performer of Musical Instruments.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Amdusias asked, </p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What are you seeing?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I said it earlier but the stories I accumulated were more intense than theirs. In fact, these words were wrong. There were fierce moments in any story but the comparison of intensity was meaningless in the first place. In this damn Star Stream, the only thing that won was time.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…I just want to be able to fight.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After hundreds of years, some constellations were dulled by the stimulation of the scenario. Rather than look for and explore new stories, they entrusted themselves to the flow of the stories they had already acquired and stopped thinking about it.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Hell Performer' is moving according to the will of demon king 'Amdusias.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Those who were masters of the stories were eventually dominated by their stories.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[A person who hasn't lived for 100 years is mocking me?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Amdusias knew that his anger wasn't entirely his own.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Hell Performer' has begun.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, the concert of hell began. The sound waves filled with the power of the 67th Demon Realm moved through the air.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aaaack!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations of Seoul shed blood and fell down. The performance of the Hell Orchestra was full of blood and death and there was nothing wrong with it. Nevertheless, I didn't back down. Amdusias was strong but it wasn't to the point where I couldn't beat him.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' is continuing.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is continuing.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My sides and shoulders were wounded by the powerful sound waves but I didn't care. The stories that I and the party members built up were protecting me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Therefore, the man who swallowed God made his own flame. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The flames of the torch rose from Unbroken Faith.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is letting out a wild roar.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is exercising control over other stories!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The stories I had were gathered around the torch.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'King of a Kingless World' is agitated.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Person who Opposes the Miracle' is afraid of the giant story.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Giant's Liberator' is following the flames of the torch.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">White flames illuminated all of Seoul. Sparks of probability penetrated my body as the berserk story stretched out from my sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The flames of the torch raced through the darkness like turbulent waves and swept away Amdusias' incarnation. The power was so strong that my hand holding the sword trembled.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is disappointed by your 'status'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' wants a fiercer spirit!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' has complaints about you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' is displeased with 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The giant stories were inherently different from other stories. The strong stories chose their master and had enormous influence, eventually becoming the master itself. In particular, the Torch That Swallowed the Myth was particularly belligerent. If I showed even the slightest gap, this story wouldn't hesitate to eat me with its own flames.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is looking at you with greedy eyes.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is ending the story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Before that happened, I had to tighten the reins on it. I had to hurry with my plan or I might end up the same as Amdusias.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Only ashes remained where the flames of the torch passed. The appearance of the demon king was nowhere to be found. This was the gap in overwhelming force.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Performer of Musical Instruments is wounded and has exited from the scenario.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have won the demon king promotion!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your Demon Realm ranking is adjusted!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have become the 67th Demon King!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your reputation is spread throughout the Demon Realm!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Several demon kings are amazed by your strength.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I heard the voice of the dokkaebi.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The winner of the Representative Exhibition is determined.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The sub scenario ― Seoul Revolution has ended.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[300,000 coins will be distributed to Kim Dokja's Company as compensation.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The indirect messages poured out.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellations of the absolute evil system have sponsored you 100,000 coins for your battle.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' likes your struggle.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is proud of your growth.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Mass Production Maker' is nodding in a warm manner.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Several demon kings are offering you goodwill.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Between the pouring messages, I could feel the eyes of the crowd from below the wall. The survivors who lived through Amdusias' attack were watching me. They didn't even know they had been used.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth towards them. </p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Everyone, it is nice to see you for the first time. I am the Demon King of Salvation.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The wings of a demon king spread out behind me while horns rose from my head. The surprised people screamed and stepped back. I took one step closer to them.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Open the walls.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was a loud sound as the Factory forcibly opened its walls. The barriers they had been trying to cross opened so easily that the people seemed perplexed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"W-What…?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Didn't you want to come in? Please enter at any time.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Is he trying to kill us?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He'll kill us! I'm sure he'll kill us!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some horror-filled incarnations started pissing themselves at my true voice. I stared at them and spoke in a resolute voice. </p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I am a demon king but I have never once persecuted incarnations for unreasonable reasons.Kim Dokja's Company has never monopolized Seoul.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, the door of the Factory was always open. It was the citizens who first distanced themselves and gazed at us with fear.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[The Factory will accept you. I won't spare you support as you go up through the scenarios one by one. I will help you build your story as much as you can.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The eyes of the people became cloudy at the words that came out of my mouth. Some made disbelieving expressions while others opposed it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How can we believe that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"T-That's right! You are already too strong. In addition, the constellations…!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I understood their feelings. Some gaps are awe-inspiring while others created despair. The scene that the incarnations just witnessed was a great story that they couldn't catch up with in their lifetime.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[There is no guarantee that you will be left behind if you start late. The speed at which we go through the scenario is different. I was in the same situation as you a few years ago.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations of the sky were looking down at me. The beings had been far away even from the first scenario.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I was an incarnation that lagged behind thousands of years compared to those constellations. Yet I came all this way.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Those beings were now in reach if I stretched out my hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at the people with my horns and wings. </p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>Look at my appearance. Do I look special?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The people were looking up at me with bemused eyes. It was as if they were looking for something inherently special in my appearance. Someone muttered, "…Can we become that?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You never know what will happen before any scenario ends. Don't give up until the end.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I turned around and spoke final words.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[The front door is open. If you wish, please come in and seek help or advice.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This might be a fake hope. Perhaps most of them wouldn't climb to the stars but they would be excited by the enchantment when they faced the starlight. Still, what the people needed right now was this fake hope.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then someone muttered my modifier. "Demon King of Salvation…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a bitter taste on my tongue.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' likes your deception.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Saviour of Corruption' reveals hostility towards you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Demon King of Salvation. The Star Stream must be as bad at naming as I was. Many people wished to survive but I wasn't a philanthropist. I only liked the people I liked and saved the people I cared about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Dokja-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, the party members were running towards me, including Jung Heewon. I waved lightly towards them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then I saw a glittering system message in the air.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The master of the 73rd Demon Realm, representative of Kim Dokja's Company.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I was going to check the message, someone spoke from behind me.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You don't need to read that. I came directly.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a familiar true voice. I stared at him with wide open eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Asmodeus.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[It's been a while, Kim Dokja.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Did you come to give up your ranking?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I came here to share a deeper friendship. Aren't we colleagues who share a giant story?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The words weren't completely wrong. In fact, a minority share of the Demon Realm's Spring belonged to him.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Are you already aware of why I'm here?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, I knew. Asmodeus had probably come here with the same purpose as the other demon kings.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Do I have to attend?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[It is a foolish question. This close to the apocalypse, you should know the answer.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I was silent as I stared in Asmodeus' serene eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Asmodeus said, </p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[The 'Duet Between Good and Evil' will soon begin. Now it is time for you to choose a side.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The gaze towards me was inquiring.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Was I 'good'? Or was I 'evil'?</p>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't only Asmodeus. The stars of the night sky split around me in unison. One side was a bright light while the other side was a dazzling light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I inwardly sighed. The Duet Between Good and Evil. The implication of this scenario being initiated was simple.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 There isn't much time until the destruction in this world. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Once the balance between good and evil collapsed, the stars in the night sky would fall one by one. It was fatal destruction that even the big nebulae couldn't escape. If my memories were correct, perhaps the first victim of the destruction—</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It would be the nebula of archangels, Eden.</p>
