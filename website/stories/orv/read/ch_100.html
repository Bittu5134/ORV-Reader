        <article class="orv_main">
            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 100: Ep. 20 â€“ Disaster of Floods, III</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">There were bright lights in the sky that shot all over Seoul.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some lights went to the north while some went to the west. However, the width of the scattering wasn't large. Most of the lights were gathered in central Seoul. It was evidence of where the incarnations were gathering to prepare for the scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Finally a contract! I will also have a contract!" The incarnations waiting in the area cried out enthusiastically.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wasn't the only incarnation who survived this far without a sponsor. Soon little stars emerged over the heads of the incarnations without a contract. The number of stars represented the number of constellations who wanted the incarnation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Sponsor Selection]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">â€“Please select your sponsor</p>
<p class="orv_line">â€“Your chosen sponsor will be your strong supporter.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps by now, all the unsigned incarnations would be seeing the same thing I was. Of course, mine was probably a bit different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">1. Prisoner of the Golden Headband.</p>
<p class="orv_line">2. Abyssal Black Flame Dragon</p>
<p class="orv_line">3. Secretive Plotter</p>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, there was the Prisoner of the Golden Headband and the Secretive Plotter. I felt sorry to keep rejecting them but it couldn't be helped.</p>
<p class="orv_line">â€¦This Abyssal Black Flame Dragon was here again. He had Han Sooyoung so why did he keep coming to me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">4. Seo Ae Il Pil</p>
<p class="orv_line">5. Bald General of Justice</p>
<p class="orv_line">6. King Heungmu the Great.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The great people of the Korean Peninsula also lined up. Seo Ae Il Pil was probably Ryu Seongryongâ€¦</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ah, our Samyeongdang also came. In addition, there was the fox Kim Yushin. Did he think I would really choose him?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The list continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">21. Goryeo's First Sword</p>
<p class="orv_line">22. God of Wine and Ecstasy</p>
<p class="orv_line">Anyone who was called Korea's best swordsman could be Goryeo's First Sword. Then there was Dionysusâ€¦ Olympus had also stepped into the race for Kim Dokja. I felt a bit confused as the list continued. It was because unexpected constellations kept appearing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">48. Black Light of Guidance</p>
<p class="orv_line">49. Scribe of Heaven</p>
<p class="orv_line">50. Ruler of Revenge and the Apocalypse</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't remember all the modifiers so I only had dim memories of Black Light of Guidance and Ruler of Revenge and the Apocalypse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, I was certain about Scribe of Heaven. That guy, he was a powerful constellation of the absolute good system. The archangel Metatron. Based on angelic authority, this guy was ranked much higher than Uriel. This was the second heavenly being. Dammit, what type of constellations were watching me?</p>
<p class="orv_line">â€¦</p>
<p class="orv_line">The hundreds of stars above my head formed a magnificent spectacle. It was a brilliance that seemed like it would light up all darkness near it. Some incarnations stared this way with soulless expressions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thatâ€¦"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What is that person?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosung stared above my head in a blank manner and muttered, "Ahjussi, you are like a Christmas tree."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellations who love the Korean Peninsula want you to keep your promise.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A number of constellations want to see your faith.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, it came. I take a deep breath and called to Bihyung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Bihyung'.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'How many are there now?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had made a promise to the constellations when fighting off Dokgak. If the number of subscribers to the channel reached 10,000 before the Sponsor Selection ended, I would choose a sponsor.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[9,812. No, 14â€¦ 16.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The number of constellations continued to rise. Bihyung's tone became tense.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There are three minutes left to complete the Sponsor Selection.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Now the result would be determined in three minutes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is looking nervously at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Unfortunately, there was no point looking at me desperately.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There are two minutes left to complete the Sponsor Selection.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' has sponsored you 200 coins.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Seo Ae Il Pil' has sponsored you 300 coins.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation King Heungmu the Great' has sponsored you 300 coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sponsorship competition was finally starting. It was a natural choice for the constellations if they wanted to stand out.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some great constellations above narrative-grade constellations are clicking their tongues.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' has sponsored you 5,000 coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This was the exact development I hoped for. Good, good. Give me more money.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' has sponsored you 30,000 coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">â€¦As expected of Metatron. It was an entirely different class. It should be obvious since he was a chancellor of heaven.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is looking at the constellation 'Scribe of Heaven'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There is one minute left to complete the Sponsor Selection.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I asked Bihyung. 'How many now?'</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[9,973â€¦ 76, 77.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It had finally reached a breathtaking level.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[9,981â€¦ 84.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">30 seconds left.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[9,993.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">20 seconds.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[9,998.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A few constellations are holding their breaths.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">10 seconds.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[9,999â€¦]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">5 seconds, 4 seconds, 3 secondsâ€¦</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Sponsor Selection has ended.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then I let out a light sigh. I gazed at Bihyung who opened his mouth with a smile.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I'm really sorry everyone.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many constellations think it is ridiculous!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was no use in yelling.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Current number of subscribers: 9,999]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The screen that floated next to Bihyung showed reality. Some incarnations saw it and their mouths dropped open. Shin Yoosung asked, "Ahjussi, are you a star on Youtube?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Maybe it was similar. I spoke in a shameless voice towards the sky. "It is too bad. I would've selected a sponsor if there were 10,000 constellations."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many constellations wonder who you would've chosen.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then Bihyung intervened.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[This information can't be revealed to protect the privacy of the incarnation.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Well done Bihyung.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A number of constellations are rioting!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sky above Yongsan-gu distorted and lightning started to fall towards the innocent people. Sparks filled the air. The dokkaebi's power to influence probability could also block the constellations' wrath.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Now now, all constellations. Please calm down. Unfortunately, the event had to be cancelled because we are lacking one personâ€¦]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then Bihyung glanced at me and continued.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[As an apology, I will create a compensation event.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The lightning temporarily stopped.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Perhaps you are thinking this? Shit, what should I do if it continues like this?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many constellations are listening to the dokkaebi Bihyung's words.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I understand your thoughts. So! I will punish the incarnation who didn't choose anyone in the second Sponsor Selection! However, I will only do this if the constellations are in favour of itâ€¦]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many constellations are in favour of the dokkaebi Bihyung's words.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung nodded with satisfaction. Shin Yoosung stared at me with a dumbfounded expression. "What is happening?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't be upset by the events unfolding."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi, why didn't you choose a sponsor?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, it isn't time yet."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Honestly, I was a bit shaken when I saw Metatron but if I chose someone here, everything I had done would be in vain. I couldn't enter under anyone else. This was the only way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Sangah-ssi. Take the kids and hide."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"â€¦Do you have an idea?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Of course. Never come out unless I signal to you."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new bounty scenario has arrived!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have become the target of the bounty scenario.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, the bounty scenario began.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<h3 class="orv_window_title">[Bounty Scenario â€“ Punishment]</h3>
<p>Category: Bounty</p>
<p>Difficulty: A</p>
<p>Clear Conditions: Brutally kill the incarnation Kim Dokja. The more brutal his death, the more coins you can receive.</p>
<p>Time Limit: 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Compensation: 40,000 ~ ????? coins.</p>
<p>Failure: â€•</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">Anyone who saw it would think I was the fifth disaster. It was 40,000 coins to kill one person. Shin Yoosung paled when she received the scenario. "â€¦Ahjussi?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah grabbed Shin Yoosung who was reaching for me and retreated. At almost the same time, the incarnations in the area discovered me and started to flock. There was the 'target' mark floating above my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Crazy! 40,000 coins?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey, get that fucker!"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many constellations are enjoying the development of the scenario.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations angry at my choice loved the way I was being chased like a rodent. Everybody had forgotten about the '10,000 event'. Yes, this was the nature of constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung glanced at me and communicated with a nasty expression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">â€“I didn't realize it would turn out like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I knew. I used to do this when working at the game company'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only way to appease angry users was to open a new event. Bihyung shivered and murmured.</p>
<p class="orv_line">â€“Is this okay? If it is noticedâ€¦ I really will receive a Probability Conformity Request this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, it was an obvious channel manipulation that the number of subscribers didn't break through 9,999.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was because from the beginning, Bihyung's #BI-7623 channel only accommodated 9,999 viewers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wouldn't be able to escape if someone like Dokgak provoked a fight. Fortunately, there was no one like that present. The low grade dokkaebis had been on guard since the last incident.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'I decided to take the chance'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was still a dangerous method. There was no doubt that some smart constellations would doubt this. The number stopped exactly at 9,999. This defied coincidence. Thus, an event to shift the attention of the constellations was needed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations hated annoying things and were vulnerable to fun. I used the current Punishment event to take advantage of that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung opened his mouth and spoke to everyone.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Constellations, please note that the incarnation Kim Dokja can receive a penalty if coins are sponsored.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment he spoke, my body suddenly became heavy.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A selfish constellations has given you a speed penalty.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[500 coins have been sponsored.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The more coins I received, the more penalties that would be inflicted on me. The incarnations, who normally never would've been able to follow me, were right on my tail.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Everyone seems blinded by the coins. Right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled and wielded Blade of Faith.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uwaaah!"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation who wants your misfortune has given you an attack penalty.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[500 coins have been sponsored.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My attack power was halved and the incarnations didn't die. I was actually glad about this. I didn't want to kill them,</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A constellation who wants your death has given you an defense penalty.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[500 coins have been sponsored.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The fucking sponsorship. A dagger flew from somewhere and hit my arm, causing terrible pain. My arm would've been cut off if it wasn't for the Infinite Dimension Space Coat.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A few constellations feel sorry for your adversity.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There were also constellations who supported me. Thank you for your tears. I grabbed my injured arm and ran to the southwest of Yongsan-gu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I was right, the meteorite where the Disaster of Floods slept was in that direction. The energy of the meteorite showed it was close to hatching.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Bihyung. What the hell is this?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What's the matter? It is simple entertainment before we enter the game.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Another dokkaebi's voice was suddenly heard. Now Bihyung was speaking in a strong manner.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a sharp contrast to my heavy body. Just a bit moreâ€¦</p>
<p class="orv_line">A river finally appeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hold it!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I barely managed to escape from the clutches of other people and plunged into Han River. The other incarnations knew what was in Han River and couldn't easily follow me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This crazy guy!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 7th grade ichthyosaurs swarmed like they had been waiting. They wanted to make my feeble self their food.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many constellations are filled with joy.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I had a thought as I watched the ichthyosaurs. I didn't have any talent. No matter how hard I trained, I wouldn't become as skilled as I wanted. However, I didn't want to use that as an excuse to say I was weak.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' can now be activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The way that I could become stronger was different from other people.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>['Character Bookmarks' is activated.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Available Bookmark Slots: 4]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Bringing up the list of available bookmarks.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I will release Demagogue Cheon Inho from the 3rd slot and add Beast Tamer Shin Yoosung."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The number three bookmark has been activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A bright light surrounded my body and the smell of the monsters changed. Some smells were friendly while some were filled with hostility. I realized that there was a world I didn't know. After all, it was sensitivity to the world that determined how a person read it.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The level of the Bookmark skill is low, shortening the activation time.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Activation Time: 30 minutes]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your understanding of the character is significant. You can select some of her skills to import.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">One of the far-off ichthyosaurs synched with me and complex circuits were forming in my head.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Advanced Diverse Communication Lv. 3 has been activated.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Taming Lv. 9 has been activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Blood flowed from my nose. This was how the kids always felt. I slowly opened my mouth, "Come, Queen Mirabad."</p>
