        <article class="orv_main">
            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 66: Ep. 14 â€“ Master of the Throne, II</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">The pages of Ways of Survival flashed in my head. A light streamed through my head and the strings of light started to line up. They were the text of Ways of Survival.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Heokâ€¦?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kim Yushin discovered something was wrong and his presence became noticeably thinner. The old fox noticed quickly.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The echo of the constellation connected through Echo of the Stars has disappeared.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">At the last moment, Kim Yushin's astounded voice was heard.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What are youâ€¦?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then Kim Yushin was gone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was surprised as well. I expected it to be possible with Fourth Wall, but I didn't think the Ganpyeongui connection to the constellation could be broken so easily.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The encounter in the Theater Dungeon was a hint. The Fourth Wall had destroyed the theatre master the moment he tried to look inside my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was hoping the same thing would happen to the constellation but Kim Yushin noticed quickly and ran away.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' has doubts about your existence.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' will be watching you closely in the future.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In any case, I was still being followed by the old geezer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"â€¦Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. I'm fine. Butâ€¦"</p>
<p class="orv_line">What was this? I looked up and found that my limbs were tied up with magic power. It was a chrysalis-like appearance. Yoo Sangah's face was completely red.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thatâ€¦ I couldn't run away but I couldn't let you attack me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I roughly understood what was going on. She used Binding Thread on me during that short interval. I thought she was frozen with surprise but she was actually using a skill.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Your improvisation is amazing."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"â€¦I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It is a compliment. If I start acting strange in the future, act like you did now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I-I will release you!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah looked embarrassed but I was serious. It was my mistake when I thought of her as an ordinary office worker.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked back and saw Min Jiwon looking between me and Yoo Sangah with curious eyes. "Wellâ€¦it turned out like this. I came to help only to end up being helped."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded. "We will be enemies the next time we meet."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"â€¦Why don't you join us now? It is a common proceeding in dramas."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This isn't a drama."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"My friend! Make friends with faith. It is the banner of our Hwarang." Min Jiwon said with a smile before moving away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Could she be a good king? I don't know. Perhaps even the King of Beauty didn't know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We will go as well. Lee Sungkook-ssi! Come on."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Sungkook emerged from behind the building with Lee Gilyoung. This bastard, when did he hide in such a place?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I took my companions and started to move north.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The place that Kim Yushin's Gather the Hwarang swept through was devastated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The armed forces of the small kings were lying all over the place. This was the dignity of a proper constellation. Kim Yushin was a cowardly but useful constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I picked up three flags and built up my achievements.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your brown flag has absorbed the cumulative achievements of the brown flag.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your brown flag has evolved into a purple flag.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are able to use the perks of the purple flag.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Indeed, the best thing was to grow without a fight. I looked around and saw that most flags had already been collected.</p>
<p class="orv_line">From the purple flag onwards, the achievement values of the flag wouldn't rise well. In other words, it was useless to grab a small king from now on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Jung Minseob-ssi, are you there?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The next moment, Jung Minseob appeared out of thin air. The Recluse's Cloak that I handed him in advance was covering his body. Jung Minseob's mission was to scout the National Palace Museum.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How many have gone inside so far?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A total of nine kings have entered, including the Tyrant King and True Reader."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Nine. It was a reasonable number.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are the flag types?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There are seven purple and two brown flags. In particular, there are two with really a really deep purple colour."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I guess they are the Tyrant and True Reader."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Minseob, wasn't his talent quite useful?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth. "This time, I will only go with Yoo Sangah-ssi and Gilyoung. Both of you wait outside. Stay hidden using the cloak."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"â€¦Will it be okay?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, I only need three people right now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will enter if you call us."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I appreciated the thought but it would just be a disruption. It was because the current Seoul Palace Museum was a dungeon.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new hidden scenario has arrived!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<h3 class="orv_window_title">[Hidden Scenario â€“ Artifact Trials]</h3>
<p>Category: Hidden</p>
<p>Difficulty: F ~ A+</p>
<p>Clear Conditions: Clear the right 'artifact dungeon' with the proper personnel.</p>
<p>Time Limit: None</p>
<p>Compensation: 500 ~ 5,000 coins</p>
<p>Failure: Death</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">A white marble lobby appeared before us as we entered the museum. There were no signs of anyone else in the lobby.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah spoke in a soft voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I can't like culture now without feeling scared. There was the previous theatre and now this museumâ€¦"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hyung, are we going to get the legendary sword?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, not right now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, I could find the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword in this dungeon. That's why I sowed the information.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Please select the type of dungeon you want to enter.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">* Single player dungeon â€“ Nagak</p>
<p class="orv_line">* Three person dungeon â€“ Acupuncture Copper Man</p>
<p class="orv_line">* Five person dungeon â€“ Dongui Bogam (Korean book compiled by a royal physician, considered as one of the classics of Oriental medicine)</p>
<p class="orv_line">* Seven person dungeon â€“ Dragon Jar</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, the dungeon with the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword couldn't be entered in a normal manner. It was because the dungeon was only accessible using the Sang Pyong Tong Bo coin which was given as a reward when clearing a dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I will choose the three person dungeon, the Acupuncture Copper Man."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have entered the three person dungeon.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Gilyoung looked a bit disappointed. He had been expecting to get a great artifact.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Gilyoung. An artifact isn't about the outward appearance."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"â€¦Huh?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There are many impressive looking things that have no substance."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword was one such item. Rather, the good things in this dungeon could be obtained from the commonplace dungeons.</p>
<p class="orv_line">An example was the skill that could be obtained the Acupuncture Copper Man dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah was amazed and surprised as soon as we entered the dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"â€¦There are other people besides us."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Intermittent screams could be heard from the dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uwaaaaack! Go away!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a monster in human form with a matte colour. The three person dungeon was filled with these copper people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the 7th grade species, the Acupuncture Copper Man.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a certain amount of time, these guys would self-proliferate unless the method to attack them was known. The Acupuncture Copper Man didn't suffer because they had a strong body, no internal organs and no neural networks.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Aaaah! Save me!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some of the incarnations' swords cut at copper men but they didn't receive much damage. Rather, they pulled the incarnations' bodies down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The body of a man in his 50s was torn to pieces in the hands of the copper men.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"â€¦Dokja-ssi, how do we deal with these guys? They don't receive damage at all."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung aimed their weapons or skills at the incoming copper men but there was hardly any effect.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Sometimes Lee Gilyoung's blunt attack would damage them but he didn't have any idea of what he did.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Look at their bodies."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The monsters that appeared in the 'artifacts trials' were based on relics kept in Seoul Palace Museum.</p>
<p class="orv_line">For example, the monsters in the one player dungeon was literally a musical instrument made of a seashell and as for the Dongui Bogam five person dungeonâ€¦ there was no need to explain anything. It was the same for the Acupuncture Copper Man in the three person dungeon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah stared closely at a copper man and opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is there something etched on the body?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That's right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, the Acupuncture Copper Man was a relic that displayed 354 acupuncture points on the human body, including the front, back, arms, legs and head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was an artifact used to study acupuncture in the Joseon Dynasty.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Blade of Faith is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I stabbed one of the acupuncture points on the copper man. Then I twisted it and the body scattered into powder. It was a meaningless end for a 7th grade reproduction species.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have hunted the first Acupuncture Copper Man!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"If you look closely, the colour for each acupuncture point was subtly different. Some are devoid of blood and some are deadly. Some of the pointsâ€¦ there is a different effect every time an acupuncture point is hit."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahâ€¦!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The important thing was to find the acupuncture point that didn't break the flow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I demonstrated a few times and Lee Gilyoung and Yoo Sangah got the knack for it very quickly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Gilyoung used Diverse Communication to shock the points with small insects, while Yoo Sangah applied Binding Thread. I honestly admired what I saw.</p>
<p class="orv_line">These two people, they really had excellent growth.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your party is the first to hunt 100 Acupuncture Copper Men!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have cleared the three person dungeon.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Four Sang Pyong Tong Bo coins are obtained as a basic reward.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Hit a Pressure Point' has been acquired.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I got the skill I aimed for.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Hit a Pressure Point. It was a unique technique to use the pressure points to subdue the enemy. It was an essential skill for me to maintain the 'King of No Killing'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah looked at the Sang Pyong Tong Bo coins curiously and muttered, "Can we buy something with this?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It can be exchanged for coins or a dungeon ticket."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thenâ€¦"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Of course, we will use it for the dungeon admission ticket. Pay me three each. I have four so combined, it will be 10 coins."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"10? Wait a minute, Dokja-ssiâ€¦?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We will enter the hidden dungeon where we can get the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah asked with surprise.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"But didn't you say we wouldn't get the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We aren't going after the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword."</p>
<p class="orv_line">We were going to 'hunt' the kings.</p>
