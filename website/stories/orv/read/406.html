        <article class="orv_main">
            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 12: Ep. 3 â€“ Contract, I</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">My body suddenly became heavy as I felt water entering my lungs. Then I was sucked in somewhere. I wasn't torn apart because I fell with perfect timing. However, I couldn't lose consciousness here. I had to stay awake. I needed to wait for a while. Somehow, I managed to curl up and hold my breath. 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 secondsâ€¦ I was barely breathing when my hands hit a tangible wall in the darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"U-Uwek." I could barely breathe even after coughing up the river water several times. My level 10 physique saved me from being killed by hitting the water surface, but the large and small bruises all over my body were very painful. In order not to fall into a panic, I controlled my breathing and then turned on my smartphone. I was worried it might've broken in the fall, but fortunately, it powered on just fine. It was good that I'd spent a lot and bought a smartphone with waterproof capabilities.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The flashlight turned on, and the surrounding scenery entered my eyes. There were huge walls with concrete by-products floating by. The insides of an ichthyosaur's stomach were more disgusting than I'd imagined.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Dammit."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk's expression as he released his grip on me without hesitation and then got off the bridge was vivid in my mind. I'd expected it, but it was still more shocking than I thought it'd be.</p>
<p class="orv_line">â€¦If I wanted to be his companion, I had to survive. It wasn't that I didn't understand. The weight of this word, 'companion', was too great for Yoo Joonghyuk. Since his failure in the first round of regression, Yoo Joonghyuk had never made a real 'companion'. It was rare for humans to easily follow the growth of a regressor. As a result, he had solved everything alone, was revered as a savior, and was naturally lonely. To Yoo Joonghyuk, 'humans' were only subordinates or enemies.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thus, this was a test. If I wanted to be in an equal position with him, I had to solve this much alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">â€¦Well, this was when I looked at it from Yoo Joonghyuk's viewpoint.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A companion like youâ€¦ Crazy psychopath."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I barely doggy paddled to a floating styrofoam panel and raised my body onto it. Thanks to the warmth of the stomach, I wasn't cold. However, the problem was what was to happen from now on. I closed my eyes and played the message log I'd heard.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have failed to clear the scenario.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Paid settlement will begin.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[100 coins have been reduced for the channel usage fee.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' has nodded at your exciting remarks.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[100 coins have been sponsored.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' nods at your choice.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[100 coins have been sponsored.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is disappointed in your rash remarks.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There were quite a few messages. Additionally, a few exposed constellations sponsored me. Maybe it was due to the final conversation I had with Yoo Joonghyuk. I felt a little down as I read through the messages of the constellations one by one and collected the coins. If I had picked one of these constellations in the first Sponsor Selection, this might not have happened. However, I had no regret in my choice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">After encountering Yoo Joonghyuk directly, I was certain. The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal might be a sponsor of the highest quality but he wasn't enough. I needed more than just 'sponsorship' if I wanted to confront Yoo Joonghyuk. That was what I would gain from here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The walls of the stomach growled, and small waves rose inside. The sea commander seemed to be moving somewhere. I turned on my smartphone and calculated the time. According to Ways of Survival, the ichthyosaur started to secrete stomach acid around three hours after ingesting food. In other words, I didn't have much time left.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Haha, it is sad that things turned out like this. It was very interesting. There was a sound effect before the dokkaebi's voice rang out.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"â€¦Dokkaebi?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Yes, that's right. You don't seem panicked at all?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I knew you would come."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Hrmm. It sounds like you were waiting for me?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Of course, I have been waiting."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A light turned on, and the dokkaebi appeared. I couldn't tell for sure from his expression alone, but this guy was clearly interested. If I was pushed here, I wouldn't be able to eat my meal. So, I deliberately spoke calmly, "Are you doing to take coins from me?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[â€¦Coins?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"You have to take coins in exchange for me failing the scenario."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Hmm, not your life?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"If it was my life, you would have written 'death' in the failure results column, not three question marks. Doesn't this mean there is room to negotiate?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[â€¦Hahaha. How interesting.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, there was a loophole in my words. The scenario message was 'Failure: ???'. This literally meant that the penalty of failure was unknown. It was just my assumption that it was in exchange for coins. Nevertheless, there was a reason why I was so certain.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Am I wrong?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was because I already knew about this scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The dokkaebi hesitated for a moment before nodding. [You are right. It's amazing that you could determine this point with such a clueâ€¦ As expected from someone who is attraction the constellations' attention.] The dokkaebi's tone was filled with sincere admiration. [As you said, you can survive this sub-scenario if you pay coins, even if you fail.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How much?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Pay 5,100 coins. Then I will let you live.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at how many coins I currently possessed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Coins Possessed: 5,100 C]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't help smiling. This brat was messing around right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That is too much."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Haha, then won't you die? It is up to me to accept the coins or not. If you do something wrong, I can just end it here.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Then kill me."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[â€¦Huh?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Kill me."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"You can't kill me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The dokkaebi didn't move. This was a natural reaction. After all, he was having a lot of fun with me right now. Furthermore, he wouldn't have come down here to see me if he had been planning to kill me. For this guy, I had to survive here or at least to die miserably.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Haha. You are really making me angry. Look, nowâ€¦ The dokkaebi's flat-shaped eyebrows wriggled furiously. It was time to stop the taunts and get to the main point.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Low-grade dokkaebi, Bihyung. How are the activities of a streamer?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">If there was a crack in the face, it would look exactly like this. Dokkaebi Bihyung showed confusion for the first time.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[H-How do you know my name?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"You haven't been enjoying broadcasting lately, right? The constellations are too stingy."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[W-Who the hell are you? How does a humanâ€¦ Bihyung's horns shook. It was a natural reaction. After all, an ordinary human couldn't know about the Star Stream system. However, I wasn't an ordinary human.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A few constellations have doubts about your existence.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter''s eyes are shining at your plan.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">From now on, it wasn't a story for the constellations. I mouthed to Bihyung, "How about we talk after you close the channel?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung was worried and closed the channel.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[#BI-7623 channel is closed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Once the constellations left the channel, Bihyung showed his true colors.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Feel free to speak. Youâ€¦ How can an ordinary human know about the Star Stream broadcasting?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"That isn't important."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Huh?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Bihyung, do you want to be 'king of the dokkaebis'?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What nowâ€•]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't you wish to be the best streamer in the network, surpassing Dokgak and Gildal?" Bihyung's complexion was changing. "Dokkaebi Bihyung, sign a contract with me. Then I will make you the king of the dokkaebis."</p>
