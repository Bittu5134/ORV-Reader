            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 34: Ep. 8 – Emergency Defense, II</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was finally the promised time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I gathered on the line 3 platform with the party. Every member was checking their weapons. Lee Hyunsung seemed to have handled it properly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I did as Dokja-ssi asked."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Since the weapons they had used so far were very old, I asked Lee Hyunsung to produce new weapons. The materials were from the grade 8 underground species, the groll that were killed in the struggle last night. The blades and spears were made by cutting the horns of the groll. They weren't long enough but they were appropriate as a temporary measure.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon smiled like she was satisfied.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Isn't this much lighter and durable?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah… Dokja-ssi, Hyunsung-ssi. Thank you very much."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah bowed. The groll's horn couldn't be used to make a blunt weapon so only Lee Gilyoung was still carrying a weapon from a ground rat. Lee Gilyoung was silently gazing at the ground. This sulking child… I stroked his head and said.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It won't be easy. This situation can be more dangerous than yesterday. Are you all ready?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The party members nodded.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then we will start."</p>
<p class="orv_line">From now on, it was a fight against time. We had to work as quickly as possible before the Landlord Alliance noticed the situation. Jung Heewon, Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung disappeared to their respective floors for their missions, while I started climbing the stairs with Lee Hyunsung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung spoke in a voice without any confidence.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Dokja-ssi, I am unsure."</p>
<p class="orv_line">…He was the core of this operation. He shouldn't be talking like this. I deliberately answered in a strong voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It will be fine."</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, Lee Hyunsung's face was still timid.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I think that people are relying on me more than they should. I'm not sure I can do well."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hyunsung-ssi is a dependable person."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…Thank you for saying so. In fact, this is my first experience. When I was in the army, I never got someone's trust like this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the first time I've heard this story. That reminded me, I didn't really know about Lee Hyunsung's army life. Ways of Survival only mentioned it in passing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Once this is over, I want to hear Hyunsung-ssi's story."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I said it casually but Lee Hyunsung was more shaken than I thought.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has started to open his heart to you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your understanding of the character 'Lee Hyunsung' has greatly increased.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Sometimes I feel strange when talking to Dokja-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh? Why…?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It seems like you knew me from a long time ago… I can't explain it well…" Lee Hyunsung scratched his head and trailed off. "Ah, I don't mean anything strange. I just…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know what you mean."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you. I'm also curious about Dokja-ssi's story."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"My story?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes. I have never seen a person like Dokja-ssi before. I'm curious about what you did before this happened."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Somehow, I felt a bit strange. The 'supporting cast' of the novel I read was curious about me. I had a bit uncomfortable and had an itchy feeling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It isn't very interesting."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I still want to hear it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Suddenly, a question popped into my head.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Ways of Survival hadn't become reality, would Lee Hyunsung be living in the same world as me? Or did the novel suddenly emerge as a reality? I didn't know. One thing was for sure. Lee Hyunsung was now a 'living person' in front of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oh, Yoo Joonghyuk's friend. Did you come to negotiate?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this time, a number of middle-aged men came forward. Chungmuro's Landlord Alliance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hmm…but where are the women?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The middle-aged man who spoke was holding a woman by her hair. She was part of the group that had been in the five spaces green zone just yesterday. The man laughed at my gaze.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahh, this friend didn't see her land… This matter doesn't concern you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"S-Save me. Help me!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The woman was gazing at me pitifully. In my head, the constellations of the 'absolute good' started clamoring. But I waited. It was because I had someone who would act instead of me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let her go."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Lee Hyunsung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who are you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung looked at me after the middle-aged man's question. It was like he was asking for permission. I nodded.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' wants to practice justice of his own will.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' is about to evolve.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The allied members pulled out their weapons and exerted a tremendous momentum. I checked the time. It was time to begin. I raised my stats with my coins.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[1,200 coins have been invested into 'physique'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Physique Lv. 15 -> Physique Lv. 18]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your physique level has increased dramatically!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[1,200 coins have been invested into 'strength'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Strength Lv. 15 -> Strength Lv. 18]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your strength level has increased dramatically!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This was the maximum efficiency with minimal investment.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Coins Possessed: 20,450 C]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I had another place to spend the remaining coins.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kwaaaang!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Small blasts were heard all over the subway. A big and small uproar followed. It was the signal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hyunsung-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung nodded. We ran forward towards the men in the front row. The confused alliance members shouted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What, you bastards!"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Purest Sword Force' has been activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Sukakak!</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kyaaak!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The arm of the middle-aged man holding the woman's head flew away. The middle-aged men froze at the blood that emerged. Lee Hyunsung and I ignored them and kept running. The middle-aged men belatedly chased after us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"These crazy guys! Stop them!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A corridor on B2. It was the private land of Gong Pildu.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have invaded private property!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Surround them!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The alliance members waiting in front discovered us. Some of the alliance members were missing, so there were less than expected. 20 in the back, 12 in the back. However, it was still a lot of people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Well, I had no intention of dealing with all of them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I was about to clash with the alliance members, Lee Hyunsung moved ahead of me with a steel shield.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has used the stigma 'Great Mountain Push Lv. 1'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Kwakakakak!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung used his tremendous muscle strength and they fell like dominoes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Gong Pildu' has activated 'Armed Zone Lv. 4!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Turrets started to rise from all over the territory. The turrets were charged with red magic bullets and were prepared to fire. There were five mini-turrets. The level of Armed Zone had risen again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Dokja-ssi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I overtook Lee Hyunsung and at the same time, I received his shield. As soon as the solid shield entered my hand, a stunning shock from a bullet pushed me away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kwang! Kwaang! Kwaang!</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was heavy, as if I was hit by a cannon. The arm holding the shield was in pain. The level 19 magic power was strong. But I had to hold on.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The compensation effect of Unbroken Faith has increased physique to level 20.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A toughness that is one step higher has protected your body.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"A cheeky tenant is here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Beyond the voice, I heard Gong Pildu's gruff voice.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Our feet were tied up by the powerful magic bullets while the alliance members were still chasing us. The durability of the iron shield was falling. Now it could only block a dozen magic bullets in the future.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gong Pildu spoke like it was interesting.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't think you came here to pay a fine. What is going on?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Now I will quit being a tenant."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How interesting. Are you coveting my land?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We'll see. More than that…"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some of the trespassers' stats are reduced by the effect of Gong Pildu's private land.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…It had started. This was why Gong Pildu's power was scary. The special effect of Armed Zone was a 'private land debuff'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Red magic power started condensing on the turrets.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Gong Pildu' is preparing the 'strengthened magic bullets'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As long as the combo of 'private land' and 'armed zone' wasn't broken, there were very few incarnations who could deal with Gong Pildu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment that the enhanced magic bullets were about to be launched, I heard the screams of people from far away. The wounded landlord alliance members were rushing to this side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"P-Pildu-ssi! The land…!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were signs they were injured by something sharp. Lee Jihye had moved. Now was the time. I looked at Lee Hyunsung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hyunsung-ssi, now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung's eyes were shaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Smash it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung raised his fists up high. He looked uneasy and irritated, but there was also a firm determination not to retreat.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has evolved.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was a blinding light and silver aura started to appear around Lee Hyunsung's bdoy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was a bit emotional at the sight. Lee Hyunsung's 'character evolution' was one of the scenes I liked most in Ways of Survival. It was the reason why Steel Sword Lee Hyunsung was called one of the strongest supporting characters. That is―</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Due to the character evolution, a new stigma has been opened.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">When it came to 'one blow', Lee Hyunsung was considered one of the strongest in Ways of Survival.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has used the stigma 'Great Mountain Smash Lv. 1'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Pale magic power gathered around Lee Hyunsung's fist and within seconds, Lee Hyunsung's arms became big enough to transcend common sense.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Haaaat!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung's fists flammed down onto the ground.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kwaaaaang!</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a loud sound and the fragments of the broken floor scattered in the air. The alliance members screamed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"W-What?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jjejejejeok!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dangerous cracks spread across the ground and the positions of the turrets started to twist. The magic bullets were fired towards the wrong place. An explosion spread and dust clouds rose. Then after a while.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Ku ku ku ku!</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a great vibration and the ground of B2 started to collapse.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The green zone has been destroyed.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character Gong Pildu's private land has been destroyed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at the collapsing ground and grinned towards Gong Pildu.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's go back to the days when we didn't have our own land."</p>
