            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 312: Ep. 59 - Kim Dokja's Company, III</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Fragments of the ceiling fell as Jung Heewon quietly stared through the dust. She could see the collapsed Han Sooyoung through her blurred vision.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Judge of Evil and Black Flames Demon Ruler. Demon-like Judge of Fire and Abyssal Black Flame Dragon.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a battle that almost all the constellations on the Korean Peninsula looked forward to but the expressions of the parties involved weren't pleasant at all. Jung Heewon stepped through the dirt and pointed the Sword of Judgment at Han Sooyoung. "Why don't you stop acting?"</p>
<div class="orv_image"><img src="../../../assets/images/312 - Jung Heewon stepped through the dirt and pointed the Sword of Judgment at Han Sooyoung.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></div>
<div class="orv_notice"><p>* Official novel illustration (canonical)</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung scattered into powder. There was a sharp ripple. Jung Heewon reflexively twisted her body and stabbed the sword behind her. There was the sound of metal being struck. Han Sooyoung untied the bandage around her right hand while the Sword of Judgment pierced through the darkness.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…You weren't fooled?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I know you have the Avatar skill." A white light emerged from the Sword of Judgment. "You are the First Apostle."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Their status collided with each other and both people fell at the same time. Jung Heewon's eyes were red after she triggered Demon Slaying. It strengthened the user's attack power but also heightened their uneasy emotions. The grief and anger amplified.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It was you who attacked the people of Chungmuro."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The battle of Chungmuro when the flag war was in full swing. It was the first time Han Sooyoung met the party members.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"At that time, Jihye and Gilyoung almost died."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…You aren't the one who almost died so why are you so angry? You weren't even there at the time."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I am angry because I wasn't there. If I was, I wouldn't have left you alone."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lights were shining in the air and the things that happened during the flag battle was projected as holographic images. Perhaps it was a service from the dokkaebis for the constellations who weren't in the channel at the time. The appearance of Lee Jihye and Lee Gilyoung as they were terribly hurt by the apostles was shown. Han Sooyoung seemed like she was going to be sick. "Then are you going to kill me now?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I can't trust you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung bit her lips. She also understood that Jung Heewon's anger was reasonable. Certainly, she was the First Apostle and at one time, the enemy of the party.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It happened one day two years ago. The rumour that Han Sooyoung was the First Apostle spread. It was unknown why the rumour spread. One thing was for certain. Han Sooyoung didn't deny the rumour. It might've been due to guilt or it could've been a cowardly heart. Han Sooyoung didn't know either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only thing she knew was the attitude of the party members towards her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Well, it is a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Really? Noona was the person who talked with your head cut off? How amazing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye and Lee Gilyoung were the ones who suffered the most during the flag battle but they didn't care at all. Yoo Sangah was already aware Han Sooyoung was the First Apostle and closed her eyes, while Yoo Joonghyuk didn't mind. However, Jung Heewon was different. "You have to atone properly."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why are you―"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If you continue roughly like this, what about the scars the kids received?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In order to make everyone happy, there were things they put up with because they didn't want to break the harmony. This was especially true for people who kept an eye on the surroundings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Han Sooyoung, if you're an adult then you should act your age. Don't be immature."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is nodding.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung's eyes became ferocious.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is angry.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"This person, do you think you're the apostle of justice? It is good to pretend to be cool but think about the time and place. Would Kim Dokja like what you are doing now?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It has nothing to do with Kim Dokja."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You said it with your own mouth. You will be Kim Dokja's sword."</p>
<p class="orv_line">For the first time, Jung Heewon fell silent. Han Sooyoung ridiculed her. "As a sword, shouldn't you move as your master tells you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm sorry." The dust on the floor sparked. The air burned wherever Jung Heewon's sword passed through. "This sword is selfish."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon activated Hell Flames Ignition. "I will decide who I cut."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Sword of Judgment aimed at Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Now your mischief is over, Han Sooyoung. Bring out all your power."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Jung Heewon' has requested the activation of Judgment Time!]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">I watched the black flames and hell flames filling the screen and sighed. "…That's why they are fighting."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it was time. Han Sooyoung's identity had been concealed for a long time but there was no way it could be maintained forever. Rather, it might be fortunate that the secret was revealed before going to the 47th scenario. This scenario didn't mean anything unless they were honest with each other. The hidden secrets exposed to the dokkaebis would become materials on the screen.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk asked, "Aren't you going?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could intervene using Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint. Jung Heewon's confused voice was heard from the screen.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some constellations of the absolute good system have opposed the request.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The activation of Judgment Time is cancelled!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced over and Yoo Joonghyuk was watching me. "…I can't leave it alone."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, I didn't intend to interfere in the fight between the two of them. However, I wanted to prevent their battle from spreading to their constellations.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The demon king 'Demon King of Salvation' doesn't want the constellations to intervene in the fight between incarnations.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is dissatisfied with your intervention.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is reluctantly convinced.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' agrees with your thoughts.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was no answer from Uriel. She wasn't allowed access to this channel yet.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk said. "One of them could die."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No, that won't happen."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You don't know the past three years. The relationship between the two of them is really bad."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes, I can see."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was unconcerned and Yoo Joonghyuk frowned. "Do you want your colleagues to die?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Or did you see the future through the power of prophecy?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't have the power of prophecy. Do you still believe in something like that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I watched Jung Heewon and Han Sooyoung fighting on the screen. Then Yoo Joonghyuk coldly replied, "It is a situation where future information is actively used to calculate everything. There is no room for the faith of humans to intervene."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It had been a while since he spoke so much. Certainly, my current appearance looked like I had no countermeasures.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Thinking about it, I had a similar conversation with Han Sooyoung of the 1863rd round. Han Sooyoung used Predictive Plagiarism and collected, calculated and read the future while collaborating with the 1863rd round Yoo Joonghyuk. I had asked Han Sooyoung,</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "It doesn't make sense no matter how I think about it." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Predictive Plagiarism was a good story and Yoo Joonghyuk's knowledge was useful. Even so, it was impossible to save everyone up to the 95th scenario, including Kim Namwoon. Numerous variables would've occurred from changing the story and unexpected things would've happened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how great Han Sooyoung and Yoo Joonghyuk were, they weren't the writers of Ways of Survival. Not everything could be absolutely controlled. Failure was expected.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "How did you get here? Tell me honestly. Is there another secret?" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung looked at me like she was either pitying me or laughing at me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I believed." 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "What?" 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "I believed in the characters I created. That's all." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This was the answer of the plagiarist writer, although I couldn't remember it well. I told Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Joonghyuk, I believe in humans."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sword and fist collided and the flames melted everything around them. I watched Jung Heewon and Han Sooyoung bleeding, shouting and rushing at each other. I looked at them and had a faint understanding of the secret behind Han Sooyoung reaching the 95th scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I believed in the story they had built."</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was another deafening roar from the screen. The two people gasped in the series of clashes. They rolled in the dust pit, striking the other person's abdomen or cutting hair. Their blood clotted as their expressions changed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–You must be very upset about me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–It isn't just that.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I seemed to hear their thoughts without using Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint. It was the history of the two people who fought together until now. The party members had survived unharmed for the past three years. They wouldn't have survived those three years without cooperation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dealing with the sasquatch in the 28th scenario. Catching the 'algonkin snake' in the 35th scenario. The two people must've protected each other's backs to survive. They saved each other's lives many times, pulling up each other with tired hands.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon and Han Sooyoung also knew this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Just…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon was strong. Even if all the incarnations in the world were counted, there were few incarnations who could surpass Jung Heewon. However, her opponent was Han Sooyoung. In a situation where Judgment Time is blocked, the outcome of this match was almost set.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Please apologize properly to the children…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jung Heewon staggered and fell forward. The hot temperature of the room gradually cooled down. Han Sooyoung looked down at Jung Heewon's fallen body and carried Jung Heewon on her back. She seemed to mumble something but I couldn't hear Han Sooyoung's voice. Perhaps it was Han Sooyoung's last pride.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a star glowing white at her feet. Han Sooyoung stared at the star and kicked it with her feet.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The scenario's time limit has ended.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation Han Sooyoung and Incarnation Jung Heewon have demonstrated their 'trust'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung raised her head and looked in my direction.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–…Is it fun to steal a look?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I turned my gaze towards other screens.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Lee Gilyoung… do you surrender?</p>
<p class="orv_line">–I don't want to! Shin Yoosung, you surrender!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung had entered a room and were crying while pinching each other's arms. I turned my head again and saw a room with an unusual landscape. Lee Jihye, Lee Seolhwa and Lee Hyunsung were together.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–This room isn't fun. Right unni?</p>
<p class="orv_line">–…Yes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Hyunsung ahjussi! Stop picking your nose and get up. The time is up.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No one touched the star and it was just a shining decoration. It was so peaceful I doubted it was a scenario.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I'm sorry Constellations. I made a mistake when distributing the rooms…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The misplaced room seemed to be over there.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation Shin Yoosung and Incarnation Lee Gilyoung have demonstrated their 'trust'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation Lee Hyunsung and Incarnation Lee Seolhwa have demonstrated their 'trust'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[All members of the nebula has met the scenario clear conditions.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Main scenario #46 - Context of the Constellation has been completed.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[None of the nebula members have harmed each other.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Compensation for the clearance is prepared.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">No one had the same story. Everyone lived a different history and understood things using different contexts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a dazzling light and the party members were summoned. Shin Yoosung, Lee Gilyoung, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Seolhwa, Lee Jihye, Han Sooyoung, Jung Heewon…</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were the people who came here with me. The faces of the party members changed as they saw us covered with wounds.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Dokja-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Unni, are you okay? How…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The party members supported each other. Jung Heewon smiled faintly while Han Sooyoung tapped the ground with her feet. I could see Han Sooyoung smiling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I raised my head and saw the sky opening. Someone sighed. "Ah…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The sky of the Star Stream had unfolded. It was a marvellous cosmic scene. At the overwhelming landscape, some people trembled. It was a deep darkness with no end. The thing that couldn't be filled up was waiting for us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosung grabbed my right sleeve and Lee Gilyoung grabbed the fingers of my left hand.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were followed by Lee Jihye, Han Sooyoung, Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon. Finally, Lee Seolhwa and Yoo Joonghyuk formed a circle around us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…Isn't this similar to that squid in the past?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was fear in Lee Jihye's voice. I smiled and said, "That's right."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The next moment, a small star shone in the night sky.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Between salvation and the demon king. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">With this light, several planets started to shine together.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Between the demon and judgment. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Between the steel and master. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Between the abyss and black flame dragon. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I saw the white lines connecting the empty universe. The stars, that seemed like they would never meet each other, were facing each other. At this moment, I understood the context of the modifiers. Perhaps the party members felt the same way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosung spoke. "Pretty."</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were stories between the stars.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The nebula 'Kim Dokja's Company' has broken through the 46th scenario!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There were still vacancies in the constellation of the nebula. One of the vacant places belonged to Yoo Sangah.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I spoke to the people. "Let's go."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Our bodies rose into the air and we soon became light. The numerous stars of the Star Stream passed by and the vast landscape of an interstellar city was seen in the distance. It took me a long time but I eventually ended up here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Olympus. Vedas. Papyrus. The grudges were piled up in me. I hadn't forgotten. Not at all.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shadows were swaying in places where the blinding light diminished. Surprisingly, someone was waiting for us at the entrance to the interstellar city. A huge shadow swaying in the light spoke to me.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Father.]</p></div>
