            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 88: Ep. 18 – A Reader's Fight, I</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">The dokkaebi's voice rang out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A group of low-grade dokkaebis were looking down like they were watching a burning house. Bihyung's figure could also be seen. He whistled when he met my eyes.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The dokkaebi in the middle of the crowd slowly opened his mouth and spoke to all of Seoul.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Incarnations of Seoul! I have to tell you unfortunate news. Unfortunately, due to the actions of some people, one of the disasters has woken up in Gangdong-gu.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The dokkaebi smiled as he met my eyes. This bastard?</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Ah, the sound of your sighs can be heard from here. I can see people who are already leaving Gangdong-gu. Haha, everyone. You should listen to the end. You will regret it later if you run away now. This disaster is definitely an opportunity for you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The dokkaebi spoke in a loud voice.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Haven't you been having a hard time gathering coins? I know it all. Your life collapsed overnight and now strange existences are taking your coins. The people who were friends yesterday are suddenly stabbing you today. I'm glad I'm not you. Right now, the stars in the sky are probably telling you, "Hey, shake your ass a little better. I'll give you 100 coins."]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A handful of constellations are giggling and laughing.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The dokkaebi didn't laugh.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I understand that you feel like shit and hate these jerks. Since the world is destroyed, you just want to live the way you want. You are very courageous but you feel a sense of helplessness when you realize that this world is divided in two. You feel disappointed when you realize that your constellation, which was barely obtained after shaking your ass, is inferior to the constellation of a successful person. You feel angry about the unfair world. I'm well aware.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some constellations oppose the dokkaebi's speech.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Speaking of which, this dokkaebi wasn't ordinary. A low-grade dokkaebi with weak courage wouldn't be able to say this. Their channel would be ruined if there was a backlash from the constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">But this was only for minority channels. The bigger the channel, the more different the dokkaebi.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They knew the laws of the story. They couldn't tell a big story if they were only obsessed with subscriptions. A true storyteller must deal with the 'person' rather than the 'audience'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I closely observed the dokkaebi who was still talking.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I have prepared something for all of you. You who are unlucky, lucky or worked hard, you have a chance to become 'someone' overnight.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The pointed horn on the crown. The leg shown through the white cap looked like a one-legged crow.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Wait a minute, surely this bastard wasn't…Dokgak?</p>
<p class="orv_line">At this moment, a huge screen appeared in the air. A bleeding boy fleeing was shown on the screen.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Now, this boy you are seeing is an SSS-grade item walking around! Are you looking at him from head to toe? His name is Myung Ilsang. He was fortunate enough to be picked by the Star Stream to go to another world. Can you imagine it? Imagine being summoned to another dimension, suddenly receiving a powerful strength, spending a hot night with a cute elf girlfriend, saving the world and being loved as a warrior! That's right. This damn guy is the 'disaster' you have to catch today.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was somewhat strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was wondering why a low-grade dokkaebi replaced the position of an intermediate dokkaebi. It was because he was the dokkaebi of a major channel.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I can already hear your resentment. How the hell can you kill an SSS-grade? Haha, there is no need to worry. This guy currently has a penalty on him. His powers are sealed. He is strong but he is a treasure chest if you hit him all at once.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"…He is creepy." Han Sooyoung clicked her tongue. As a writer, she had already grasped the dokkaebi's intentions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">If a disaster was called a disaster, no one would come. Then what if the disaster was a treasure chest?</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Your life hasn't been ruined yet. Rather, I can say that you have good luck. The sub scenario that I offer now will be a great stepping stone to reverse your life. Now, the chance will only be for one day! Move immediately! Only those who move the quickest can become the owner of an SSS-grade item!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as they heard this, the incarnations scattered throughout Seoul would gather in Gangdong-gu.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The sub scenario has been updated.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<h3 class="orv_window_title">[The sub-scenario – SSS-grade Hunt]</h3>
<p>Category: Sub</p>
<p>Difficulty: B ~ ???</p>
<p>Clear Conditions: Get rid of the SSS-grade Myung Ilsang.</p>
<p>Time Limit: None</p>
<p>Compensation: 50,000 coins, ???</p>
<p>Failure: The fall of Seoul Dome.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">The worst scenario was beginning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps due to the failure result of the scenario shining red in the air, the huge reward that had never been seen before seemed insignificant.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Quickly find him before everyone dies."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…Won't he be affected by probability?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The probability is offset to some extent by the interest of the constellations."</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was why dokkaebis preferred exciting scenarios. The stories that many constellations wanted offset the probabilities. Of course, it would be the responsibility of the dokkaebis if it failed, but this situation was different.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The eyes of many constellations are shining.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">If it went as Dokgak planned, Seoul would end before the fifth scenario began. Han Sooyoung immediately used all her magic power to summon the avatars to search.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Five minutes passed before Han Sooyoung shouted, "I found him. He is 2km northwest from here!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I ran along the road with Han Sooyoung and soon heard voices.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Over here! There he is!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That brat went this way!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were already people flocking. Myung Ilsang was laughing as he was surrounded by a group of people.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uh… right. Here I am."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You jerk! Are you having fun?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm having a lot of fun…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This fuc…hey! Kill him!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was surprising to see so many humans with an inferiority complex. Myung Ilsang avoided the swords waving through the air and asked, "Are you jealous and want me to send you to that other world?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What, you will send me there?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Of course. I will send you. You really want to go right?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"If I can go then of course I want to go! It is better than this shitty world…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Myung Ilsang nodded and extended his right arm towards the crowd.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The eighth seal of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been released.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The ninth seal of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been released.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">·····.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Then go well. Although I have no idea if it is better than here."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The twelfth seal of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been released.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The thirteenth seal of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been released.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The fourteenth seal of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been released.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">·····.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a sense of hopelessness as I watched the messages appearing in the sky. It was too late.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Because that place, I destroyed it."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Myung Ilsang' has triggered 'Small Black Fire Cannon' Lv. 3!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I grabbed Han Sooyoung and rushed behind a building.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A violet flash overturned the forest of buildings. Up to half a dozen high-rise buildings were hit and an entire street disappeared. Those who ran towards him disintegrated without leaving even bone dust behind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A single entity that could be a disaster. This was the real strength of a returnee.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung collapsed beside me. "Crazy… how do we defeat that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was real fear. It was fear that caused our bodies to shake, rather than a skill. I spoke in an effort to resist it. "We can win."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Don't speak nonsense and let's go back. We can never kill that guy."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"No. I can catch him. We will be better off if I kill him now'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Han Sooyoung' has used 'Lie Detection Lv. 2'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung's eyes widened. "…Really? You couldn't kill him before."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A person who only thinks about one thing, how can you live?" I was only speaking a half truth. In fact, the original plan was to defeat the Disaster of Questions and build up a second narrative.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The problem was that my plan was based on learning Way of the Wind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Does anyone else want to go to the other world? Raise your hands! I will send you!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">People screamed and ran away. Myung Ilsang was getting closer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then Yoo Joonghyuk's voice was heard from a translucent window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–There is no chance if you fight him head on.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–I know. But I still have to try it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Why did you make the situation like this?</p>
<p class="orv_line">–What?</p>
<p class="orv_line">–You had many chances. You could've killed Lee Seolhwa. Or if you had killed Antinus with Lycaon, you could've stopped the disaster.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't give any excuses. I didn't kill Lee Seolhwa because of Yoo Joonghyuk and I didn't fight with Lycaon because I couldn't find a gap.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–I'm not a regressor like you. I have to be careful in case of failure. If I don't think until the end…</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Careful? Don't be so cocky. Do you think you are a constellation? Knowing the future doesn't mean you can control everything.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I felt like someone had punched me. Funnily enough, I thought that Yoo Joonghyuk's words were right.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is in use.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was arrogance from knowing the future. I thought I could somehow make it even if the story was distorted. Maybe that led to the current situation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Then why don't you fight a little?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't answer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Don't use having no talent as an excuse. Not having the Way of the Wind doesn't mean you can't win.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–I can win?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk was silent for a moment. The moment I was about to break the silence, Yoo Joonghyuk's voice continued.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–My attribute is a 'pro gamer'. What is yours?</p>
<p class="orv_line">–What?</p>
<p class="orv_line">–I'm asking what can you do well?</p>
<p class="orv_line">…What could I do well? There was a tickling feeling somewhere deep in my head. I felt that I was missing something important. But there was no time to think.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I've found you! You haven't left yet."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Myung Ilsang whistled as he rounded the corner. Han Sooyoung groaned while I stepped back.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…Uh?" The Hunters Association people from before?" Myung Ilsang laughed. "Great. I really wanted to meet you. Don't you know that my wonderful debut plans were ruined because of you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I was trying to live well. Kill some S-grade incarnations, defeat the bad groups and love the pretty noonas. But what is this? I have completely become a villain. What should I do?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grasped my sword instead of answering.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The stigma 'Song of the Sword Lv. 1' has been used.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your sword is filled with the words left by the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Today I am prepared for death. I pray to God in Heaven, may I destroy the enemy. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Duke of Loyalty and Warfare's words recorded in his war diary. Fortunately, the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare took my side this time.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The stigma 'Song of the Sword' has been used.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The decision to die has improved your fighting power.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I squeezed out all of my magic power at once.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Blade of Faith is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Blade of Faith burst out. I ran towards him. Myung Ilsang's hands lightly struck the Blade of Faith.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The splitting pain caused me to loosen my grip. It was only one blow but I could clearly know it. The overall stats of Myung Ilsang had already exceeded the limit of this scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What, you want to fight? Really? Didn't you just see me fighting?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at him laughing and was reminded of Ways of Survival. What could I do well? It was to 'read'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 1 has been activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then I started to hear his movements.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Right shoulder. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Left thigh. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The strikes still hit me despite me reading the moves. The fists surrounded by a purple light ruthlessly poured towards me.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The belly, the belly, the belly, the belly. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Blood poured from my mouth and my vision shook. I didn't give up. I thought and thought again.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Myung Ilsang' admires your spirit.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your understanding of the character 'Myung Ilsang' has increased.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The information contained in Ways of Survival alone couldn't beat him. It was different from when I hunted the Dark Keeper. I couldn't fight despite calculating everything.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Strong, weak, torso, head… 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Too much information poured in at once, causing my dizziness to worsen. This was despite borrowing the power of the stigma. At this rate, the battle would be over in no time. I wiped the blood at my mouth and backed away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…Did I have to use Ganpyeongui? I felt bitter that the last method I had was to borrow the power of the constellations. If I called a powerful constellation, I could probably win.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there was a burden of the probability after the last incident and most of all, I didn't like to owe the constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Damn, I wish I had talent. It would be preferable if I could steal someone's talent.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…Eh? Wait. Steal? A dull shock filled my head. So far, my main weapon was 'information'. However, there was so much 'information' that I actually forgot some of it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Pathetic. Why the hell did I forget about this skill? Wasn't this the first thing I should've done?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' can now be activated.]</p></div>

<p class="orv_line">As expected, Yoo Joonghyuk's name wasn't on the list. The main character was the main character. Special conditions must be met before he was unlocked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In addition, people who weren't characters like Han Sooyoung, Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung weren't on the list.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It didn't matter. They weren't the people I needed right now. I scrolled for a bit and finally found the person I wanted.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There he was. Why did I forget that he was also a 'character'. I didn't hesitate to put him in the fourth bookmark.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The level of the Bookmark skill is low, shortening the activation time.]</p></div>

<p class="orv_line">Damn, I felt like a fool. What had I been trying to learn so far? I wasn't a regressor or a returnee.</p>
