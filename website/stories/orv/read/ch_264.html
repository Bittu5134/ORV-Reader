<p class="orv_line">"The fourth bookmark."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Way of the Wind Lv. 11 (+1) is activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I avoided the flying sting of the Scorpion Goddess. If the strength of her body hadn't been suppressed, the poison would've vaporized the whole area. However, it was fine since I had Way of the Wind.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stepped on the melted gorge and release the Purest Sword Force. My sword cut the bandages of the Last Pharaoh. The moment my sword hit the bandages, there was the sound of a drum beat. King Oedipus didn't miss this gap and flew forward.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Beast King's Sensitivity Lv. 10 (+1)' has been activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Normally, this was an impossible fight. Originally, only one bookmark could be used at a time.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The effect of 'Looked into the Abyss' has improved all your skills!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Currently, two bookmarks are being used at the same time.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The duration of Bookmark is reduced by half.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">All my skills had improved since the last time I checked my Attributes Window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The fifth bookmark!"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Electrification' Lv. 12 (+2) has been activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I became smaller through Miniaturization. Then I turned into a point of light and penetrated the torso of the Last Pharaoh. The Last Pharaoh suffered a fatal wound and collapsed to the ground with a scream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was fighting with the history I had built up. The things I read. The times I had lived. Everything that I had. How many more flashes of light were seen and how much blood was spilled?</p>
<p class="orv_line">King Oedipus opened his mouth and spoke in a slightly weary tone. [Great, Demon King of Salvation.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Honestly, I didn't think you would be this strong.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Nevertheless, there wasn't a look of defeat on his face. Shadows flocked to the top of the gorge. They were the other constellations belonging to Melledon and Bercan.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Duke Bercan.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Mysterious Bird of the Nile.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Supreme God of Light.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<p class="orv_line">The number of constellations that appeared was close to 10. They looked down here from the high cliff of the gorge. I was stifled by the presence of the constellations but I didn't back down.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you just going to watch from there?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Rather, I raised the 'status' that was sleeping inside me. I was also a constellation. I didn't lose to them in terms of 'status'. Some of the constellations were crushed by the status I released and stumbled back. However, it wasn't everyone.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You're an interesting child.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">All of a sudden, some of the constellations on top of the canyon bowed and retreated. Someone was approaching from among the constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">His long, golden hair waved every time he took a step and his four arms drew a beautiful rainbow. The third eye on his forehead looked down here like the sun coming out.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Mithra was trying to get his own holiday off so I was wondering what type of person you were.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">His blinding appearance made his modifier obvious.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'The Supreme God of Light'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I even knew his true name. "Surya."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Dazzling sparks appeared when I mentioned his real name. It was a sight that attested to the status of the name.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Kid, do you know my name?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I know."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The nebula Vedas had eight great Lokapala. They were the guardians of the eight cardinal directions, including north, south, east and west.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Surya of the southwest."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surya was one of the eight Lokapala.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Mass Production Maker' is frowning.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Goddess of Love and Beauty' is accusing the 'Supreme God of Light'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is pointing out that this behaviour doesn't fit the status of the Supreme God of Light!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He was a powerful being equal to the 12 gods of Olympus. This presence was staring at me.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[If so, you know that you can't win this game.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The status of over 1,000 years emerged from his body and I suppressed the desire to step back. He wasn't a constellation I could fight against. Lokapala Surya was different from King Oedipus and Cleopatra, who were humans that became constellations.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Come to Vedas. You will die even if you win this game.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't want to."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You don't know the world that will appear after the giant story. Do you think you can stand against that power alone? It isn't a story that only one star can afford.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I knew what he was saying. Perhaps the world that Surya saw was different from the world that I saw. Just by obtaining a single 'giant story', the level of the world that the constellation could perceive was entirely different.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Nope, I can afford it. I'm not alone."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The possibility of a new story is germinated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 73rd Demon Realm wriggled as if in response to my words. Surya felt the vibrations and said, [You aren't alone… how funny. Who is with you now?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A person who is more familiar with the cause and effect law than anyone else is saying this… it is truly ridiculous."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A powerful storm started to flow from Surya's incarnation body. The constellations around him turned pale. Still, he couldn't exercise all his power in this game, no matter his status. Sparks burst out in a dazzling manner.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In this game, Melledon had won two points. These two points might be able to free one of Surya's stigmas. I couldn't let that happen. As I moved, the constellations blocked my way.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A fist containing the power of Electrification struck the face of the constellations. The Broken Heart of a Young Gold Dragon repeatedly pumped and created a massive amount of magic power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't hesitate to release this strength. A little more, just a bit more. I had to draw my magic power to the limits.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations couldn't cope with the power of Electrification and fell down while bleeding. It was a transcendent power that could even destroy constellations. The white lightning burnt the bodies of the constellations.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The participant 'Demon King of Salvation' has killed the helper 'Scorpion Goddess'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The participant 'Demon King of Salvation' has killed the helper 'The Last Pharaoh'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The broken heart of the gold dragon couldn't afford the magic power and the energy in my body suddenly fell sharply. I gritted my teeth and moved. I dealt a blow to Duke Bercan and immediately turned my back to him, striking a blow to the Mysterious Bird of the Nile.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are overly affected by the character!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The excessive use of Bookmark can leave a permanent injury on your soul!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Meanwhile, the Supreme God of Light wasn't perplexed at all as he saw me moving closer.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I have watched you for a long time. You always borrow the power of other beings.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Beast King's Sensitivity wrapped around my body while I prepared to deal a blow with Electrification.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[From the first scenario to the present, you have never fought with your own power. Do you really]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">think you can build up your own story?]</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[The history that you've learnt is just history that came from stealing.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It felt like I was facing hard steel. The Supreme God of Light used only one of his four arms to block the blow from Electrification.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[It isn't yours.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The third eye of the god shone as brightly as the sun. At that moment, I realized what stigma Surya had released.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Supreme God of Light' is invoking the 'Third Eye'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My vision distorted and all the light around me disappeared. In the darkness, I felt the edge of this space gradually crumbling.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There is no 'you' in your story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Everything around me was already Surya's space.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You will die alone.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Third Eye had the power to control time and space. It was the power of Surya's Third Eye. I was confused because I didn't think Surya would use this power so quickly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">How could I get out of here? It wasn't possible to use Electrification and Way of the Wind.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The legendary story 'Distorting Things as One Pleases' has activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't know what to read. King of a Kingless World wasn't suitable. Person who Opposes the Miracle was also ambiguous. The same was true for One Who Hunted the King of Disasters.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The space was now reduced to one square metre. What should I do?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Distorting Things as One Pleases' is screaming.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My back was tingling when I heard a sound. It sounded familiar, as if someone was eating a story.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 De li cious food. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked back and a small mouth was stuck to my back, eating my story.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Kim Dok ja is a fo ol. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was the Fourth Wall. This bastard wasn't going to help me? The torn apart 'Distorting Things as One Pleases' was now nearly useless and was entering its stomach.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I forgot the urgency and shouted at the absurd situation. By the way, the thing that came out of my mouth wasn't a yell.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The Fourth Wall said, "Ku waa aaah!" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">An explosive burst of sound poured into the surrounding space. The space trembled like it was a living creature and a gigantic crack formed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The stigma 'The Third Eye' is shuddering.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I realized what was going on. The Third Eye was a mental ability that controlled time and space by manipulating cognition. The Fourth Wall was the strongest skill I had in regards to a mental barrier.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Supreme God of Light' is astonished!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The darkness collapsed like glass breaking. Once the light returned, the first thing I saw was tears coming from the eye on the forehead of the Supreme God of Light.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You… what are you?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The astonished true voice resonated and the other constellations hurriedly rushed towards me.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You dare… die!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">My magic power was at the bottom. I didn't have enough power to open Bookmark again. Nevertheless, it wasn't necessary anymore. It had been 20 minutes since the game started.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The fog of the gorge is thickening.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was a groan from somewhere in the gorge and the movements of the constellations stopped. The nervous constellations looked at the top of the gorge and a dark shadow fell towards this side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nervously slid down a rocky wall. It had been a long time since I saw something like this. The length was five kilometers. The body with a circumference of over 10 metres was falling towards the ground along with the collapsed upper part of the gorge. The constellations let out warning signals but the large ones were crushed under the scales of the giant monster.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The helper 'Mysterious Bird of the Nile' has been killed by the 'Apocalypse Imoogi'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The monster burst like a bug and coiled up in the gorge, crying towards the air. The Apocalypse Imoogi. It was the name of the monster I had been waiting for.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Damn! Don't back down!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations were overwhelmed by the sudden disaster and started attacking with their stigmas. The one who killed the monster could get a powerful team buff.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, there was no way I could knock it down. According to Ways of Survival, the Red Dragon of the Apocalypse who appeared in Armageddon had the fearsome power to blow up a third of the stars in the sky with a single tail.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Kuaaack!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, this imoogi wasn't at the level of the Red Dragon of the Apocalypse but there were no constellations who could deal with this monster at the beginning of the game.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Kueeeeok!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations screamed as they were torn apart by the teeth of the imoogi while those struck by the tail were blown away. The unstoppable system messages were signalling the devastation of the gorge.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In a moment, seven participants and helpers died in the gorge. The surviving constellations escaped from the gorge using the sacrifice of other constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surya's cold voice echoed through the gorge. [You have a wicked trick up your sleeve. However, you won't be able to make it.]</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Apocalypse Imoogi struck the constellations and was now looking at me. A red sphere gathered at its mouth in order to dissolve the last insect. The red flames of the apocalypse. It was the fire of judgment that could melt everything on the ground.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The plan was okay. Melledon and Bercan suffered deadly damage and the disadvantage of the game was now balanced to an almost equal level.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…I would've liked to have a bit more strength left. My death here meant we would be deprived of our sentences. I felt regret and emptiness. If we went to the third game… was there a chance for us to win?</p>
<p class="orv_line">My eyes slowly closed as dark red flames headed towards my head. The waves of heat enveloped my body and there was the sizzling sound of rocks melting. Still, I didn't die no matter how much time passed.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new helper has been summoned to the game!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my eyes and saw someone in front of me. He wore a neat commando uniform. The soldier with the special forces mark on his shoulder was blocking the flames with a huge shield.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Master of Steel' is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He had endured even the hottest Hell Flames Ignition.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A captain of South Korea's special operations command…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I watched the trembling man swallowing and sighed. 'How' or 'why'. I wanted to ask but didn't say anything. Numerous voices were pouring towards me through Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint and all my words were pointless.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Afterwards, a giant 'chimera dragon' was seen falling from the sky.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A new helper has been summoned to the game!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I saw the little girl sitting on the head of the dragon and funnily enough, felt a bit tearful.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ahjussi!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The helpers that Yoo Joonghyuk called finally reached the battlefield.</p>
