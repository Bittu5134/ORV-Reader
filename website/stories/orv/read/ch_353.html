            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 353: Ep. 66 - Beyond Good and Evil, III</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Under the rubble, Yoo Joonghyuk's hands were sticking out. Han Sooyoung stared down at Yoo Joonghyuk. "This jerk, always appearing and trampling on people… do you feel good doing so?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Incarnation 'Han Sooyoung' has an 8.9% share in the giant story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, Han Sooyoung would have the correct amount of shares.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Narrators participating in the good or evil judgment can't 'gift shares. It meant that those who hadn't yet participated would be able to exchange their shares.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung watched me and grumbled through Midday Tryst.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–I lost 0.1% of this story to Lee Seolhwa.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps Han Sooyoung had adjusted her shares ownership to Lee Seolhwa as soon as she learnt the information here. Then she came straight to this place. Han Sooyoung turned towards the surrounding constellations and declared with a growl, "I am evil. In addition, that fucking Kim Dokja standing over there is definitely evil."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung made me evil regardless of everything else and continued looking at Yoo Joonghyuk and the party members.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"However, Kim Dokja's Company isn't good or evil."</p>
<p class="orv_line">This person shouting with her short hair flying looked amazing. At this time, Han Sooyoung could be seen as the main character, not Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The time limit has expired and the judgment of good and evil has been finished.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A total of 91.8% has participation in the judgment of good and evil.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The participation rate of good and evil is 45.9% : 45.9%.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Good and evil are in perfect equilibrium.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The astonished demon kings and constellations were looking this way. I looked back at them and added, "We aren't defined by your definitions."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is a story that can't be distinguished between good and evil.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The message drove in a wedge. I could see the dokkaebi in charge of hosting this event smiling. It seemed that he thought it would be like this or perhaps he wanted this ending.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The bureau must be excited right now. It was due to the huge amount of indirect messages entering my ears.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is satisfied with your judgment.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is proud of you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Father of the Rich Night' is pleased with your mettle.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A number of constellations of the neutral system favour your nebula.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellations of the neutral system have sponsored you 281,000 coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was expected that the constellations of the neutral system would like this. Some choices would occur while rejecting other choices.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Someone has recommended your story to the Star Stream.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have acquired a new story!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, this didn't apply to all constellations.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your choice has caused resentment among some of the constellations.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What…?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[The good or evil of the story isn't determined?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The atmosphere of the constellations and demon kings were rapidly changing.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellations of the absolute good system oppose the ruling.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellations of the absolute evil system oppose the ruling.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">An unusual flow was detected around the two tables, as if a riot would occur.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Such a thing can't happen! Bureau, judge it again!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What the hell is this?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">From the demon kings to the archangels. All the gazes of the attendees were fixed on the dokkaebi. The advanced dokkaebi felt the crisis and responded while sweating. </p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Sorry, it isn't possible. No one can reverse the outcome of a story that has already been judged. That's the rule.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Fortunately, the bureau kept to its principles. However, keeping to the principles didn't always bring about a good result.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…I was going to wait and see this season.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Things were flowing differently from expectations. The mid and low ranked demon kings rose from their seats and released their status.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[If the targets can't decide good and evil, we have to make a decision in another way.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Once the demon kings moved, the archangels stood up like they wouldn't lose.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many demon kings are showing hostility to the angels of the absolute good system!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many archangels are showing vigilance towards the demon kings.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The balance of good and evil is shaking!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The two camps confronted each other and it seemed they would rush forward at any moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stayed closed to the party members and watched the situation. By my side, Jung Heewon pulled out the Sword of Judgment and spoke in a tense voice. "Dokja-ssi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's okay."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I guarded the party members, who seemed relieved. The Great War of Saints and Demons might take place but such a huge event wouldn't occur here.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' is dissuading the archangels.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The demon king 'Ruler of the East Hell' is controlling the demon kings.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps Scribe of Heaven Metatron and Ruler of the East Hell Agares knew this as well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Good and evil must exist. If the scenario was triggered here, the two camps would be destroyed by a disaster. If I was right, the damn dokkaebis of the bureau would understand this the best.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The great dokkaebi 'Baram' has revealed his presence on the stage.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A great dokkaebi appeared like he had been waiting. Great Dokkaebi Baram. I was familiar with him in the original novel.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Stop it. I'm sure you know that fighting here won't solve the problem.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The hard voice caused the demon kings and constellations to revolt.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[The bureau can't intervene in this fight!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Do you mean to end it like this?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Some of the constellations and demon kings gathered here were close to the myth-grade. Thus, it was natural for them to not listen to the great dokkaebi. The story might've been different if the dokkaebi king came directly. Complaints came from everywhere and Baram told them.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[There is no reversal of the ruling. In addition, we can't allow hostilities in this place.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The resolute declaration caused the sparks flying in the air to block the absolute good and absolute evil members. The opposing constellations were about to rebel again when Baram continued. </p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Your complaint is that the status of good and evil can't be determined. If that's the case, how about one more giant story?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…What does this mean?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[We will open up a previous scenario to determine the status of this season's good and evil.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't conceal my confusion at the words of the great dokkaebi. This guy, what now…</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Star Stream agrees with the decision of the great dokkaebis.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Duet Between Good and Evil wants a new scenario to determine the status of good and evil.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The probability of the Star Stream was moving. The rivers of the galaxy were flowing towards the desired story of many constellations. The scenario that this probability was moving towards could be found in the hands of the Star Stream.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Ruler of the East Hell asked, </p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Do you mean to open the Great War of Saints and Demons now?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[If you want.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Baram's declaration caused an uproar among numerous constellations. Baram made an unknown smile as he looked at me.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[However, please set the stage of the scenario yourself.]</p></div>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">During the intermission, the constellations and demon kings spoke among themselves about where to set the stage for the Great War of Saints and Demons. Fortunately, the hostile gazes poured towards us seemed to relax thanks to the dokkaebi's intervention.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The party members were exhausted by the sudden situation and sat down. Han Sooyoung kicked at Yoo Joonghyuk's hand that was sticking out from the pile of stones. "What is this? Why hasn't he come out yet?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk showed no reaction. I observed the hand of the buried man but I was afraid to grab hold of this hand. The words spoken by him were still ringing in my ears.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Or is it information from the book called Ways of Survival?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Where did he hear this story? How far had the filtering been lifted and how much did he know about Ways of Survival?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung and I cooperated to bring him out. Yoo Joonghyuk was unconscious. It was strange. He couldn't pass out just because he was hit by a pile of stones.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…Why is this jerk in this state?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked closer and saw that Yoo Joonghyuk's body wasn't normal. I didn't know where he went but his body was covered in large and small wounds. There were traces of him killing and cutting something. In the past two days, Yoo Joonghyuk seemed to have wandered through a scenario I didn't know about. Under these circumstances, he couldn't overcome his anger towards me and suffered severe injuries.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung activated Midday Tryst and immediately sent me a message.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Yoo Joonghyuk has noticed the existence of Ways of Survival.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–I know. Yoo Joonghyuk told me before you came.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I gave a brief overview of Yoo Joonghyuk's words. Han Sooyoung frowned deeply when she heard the story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–…This jerk, where did he hear about it?</p>
<p class="orv_line">–I don't know. Where have you been?</p>
<p class="orv_line">–I killed the remaining prophets. I wondered if the information leaked from them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Did you figure it out?</p>
<p class="orv_line">–No.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was as I expected. The prophets would become characters once they ran out of information.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–The information didn't leak from the prophets. In my opinion…</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at Metatron who was discussing something with the archangels in the distance. Perhaps Yoo Joonghyuk became aware of Ways of Survival through Metatron.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung said,</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Asmodeus also knew about the existence of Ways of Survival. Perhaps most of the top constellations know.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The top constellations… It was also time for the Seekers of the End to become active. Finally, I could start to see the end of this long-running scenario.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked down at the fallen Yoo Joonghyuk. Han Sooyoung stared at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Kim Dokja, think about what's important right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded. I looked up and Great Dokkaebi Baram was staring at me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–We also have to participate in the Great War of Saints and Demons.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Are you crazy? It isn't a scenario we can enter with our level right now.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung was right. Originally, the Great War of Saints and Demons was a main scenario in the 80s. I hadn't intended to do this either. It was better to avoid the dangerous scenarios if possible. However, I couldn't do that with the Great War of Saints and Demons. It didn't matter if it didn't wake up but once the scenario occurred, it absolutely couldn't be avoided.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–It doesn't matter if it is a higher-ranked scenario. The problem is the stage of the war.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–What…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Baram clapped in the distance. The constellations sat in place and Baram opened his mouth.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[We will end the recess. Constellations and demon kings, please choose the stage of the scenario.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As if waiting, the constellations and demon kings stood up and shouted.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The stage of the Great War of Saints and Demons will be the 14th Demon Realm―]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Our Guardian Tree is a good giant story stage.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What nonsense is that? The stage is…!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">They all tried to make a place favourable to them as the stage. There was also a place I wanted as the stage but no one would support me if I spoke. I thought to myself. How to do…</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (Dokja-ssi, do you want the island as the stage?) 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then I heard a message from Yoo Sangah in my head.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (Perhaps I can help?) 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'…Huh?'</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (I found something interesting inside the wall.) 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'Interesting?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no answer from Yoo Sangah. Instead, I heard a rustling sound in my head. After a while, an uneasy atmosphere occurred in the loud hall.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Several constellations were whispering together.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[The information that just came in…]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What? Is that true?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I noticed their whispers.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…Were they constellations with the power of 'revelation'? The atmosphere was becoming graver. The whispers spread like waves. After five minutes, even Metatron was making a serious expression. The voices of the arguing constellations and demon kings died down one by one. After a while, they started to glance at each other. It was the demon kings who acted first in the fierce battle of wits.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I'm sorry, there is a bit of work to do and I have to go.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Me too! It is the same for me.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Several demon kings suddenly disappeared from their seats. I watched their faces closely. They were those associated with the Seekers of the End.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I'm sorry but I have to leave for a while.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Once the Morning Star Goddess of the Guardian Tree nebula spoke these words, the situation became a one-sided wave.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I have a little work too─]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">More and more people left and Metatron sighed lightly before glancing at Baram.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I think you'll have to decide on your own.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Great Dokkaebi Baram's eyes widened as he looked at the air.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…Interesting. A revelation at this timing?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Several constellations noticeably flinched at the word 'revelation'. Baram laughed. </p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…Good. Even if everyone doesn't speak, the stage has already been decided―]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I listened to the words of the great dokkaebi and was in a daze. What the hell just happened? Then pain suddenly shot through my head.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The probability of the Star Stream is doubting you!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I perceived a terrible gaze staring at me. It was gazing at me as if it found something suspicious. The gaze lasted for a moment before disappearing.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Star Stream has turned its gaze from you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I wiped my sweat and cautiously called out to Yoo Sangah.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Yoo Sangah-ssi? What did you do?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah was silent like she was looking for words to explain. Then she said.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (Dokja-ssi, do you know how constellations read the future?) 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'…I know'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were two main ways in which the constellations could read the future. One way was to gather data to measure the future, like Hermes' system. The other way was to receive a revelation like the Moerae, Eden and some of the demon kings. It was a force called 'divine revelation'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Sangah searched for words for a moment before replying with a light laugh.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 (Well, I think I became a god.) 」</p></div>
