            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 263: Ep. 49 - The Best at Something, V</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk's attribute evolved and the game flowed smoothly like water.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has killed the helper 'Founder of Humanity'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has won the 'Living Legend' title!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations hadn't yet adapted to the game and weren't able to follow Yoo Joonghyuk's movements. The constellations were inferior to Yoo Joonghyuk in terms of utilizing game items, understanding the terrain and the extra buffs.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has started to write a new myth on this Mythical Battlefield!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is raising his name in the rankings of the Mythical Battlefield!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Victory or defeat was decided in an instant.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The time limit for the first game is over!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The winning team will be determined based on the pointed obtained during the time limit!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The winning team of the first game is the 'Yoo Joonghyuk - Kim Dokja Industrial Complex'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">We got a total of six points. In addition, the sentence we took away from the opposing team meant we had two sentences.</p>
<p class="orv_line">『 The flower of the story blooms in the cruel Demon Territory. 』</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung stared at the sentence we had obtained several times before looking up blankly. "…We really won?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yes."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I also didn't feel it was real. No matter the situation, we obtained the first victory against the mighty constellation… it wasn't a level to be elated by the fact that things went 'as planned'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' is looking at you with interest.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many constellations are cheering for the Yoo Joonghyuk - Kim Dokja Industrial Complex!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have obtained 100,000 coins each as a reward for the first game!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I was able to see Yoo Joonghyuk approaching from a distance. I wanted to say something nice but Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth first. "The messages were sent by this person."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before I could ask what he was talking about, Biyoo popped out of Yoo Joonghyuk's arms.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Baaat!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Biyoo seemed invigorated as she swung the Uriel doll like it was a toy.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' insists that she didn't do anything!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Biyoo threw the doll into the air and entered my arms. I stroked her head a few days before asking Yoo Joonghyuk, who had grabbed the doll.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Where the hell did you go?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I went to the vicinity of Melledon."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why there…?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There was an item I had to obtain."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Item? What is it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You don't need to know." Yoo Joonghyuk's expression was somewhat dissatisfied as he stared at me. "In addition… I thought it would be helpful to start at an unexpected position for the selection."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It was a good judgment."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the first round, the spawn location different depending on where you were when the game started. Yoo Joonghyuk hadn't departed from the same place as us and was able to farm items using a completely different route. This made it easier for him to aim at the enemies.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Hahaha, something amazing happened. However, the game isn't over until it ends!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I heard Bihyung's voice from the air. His expression seemed somewhat excited because we won.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[5 minutes later, the second game will start!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't the time to be drunk on victory. This game had a total of three rounds. I looked over at my weary party members. The bodies of the dead Samyeongdang and Osu were revived again.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Now we just need to win one more time. The game is over if we win two rounds first. So everyone, just try a bit harder…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I tried to cheer them up but the condition of my party members wasn't good.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Samyeongdang, why do you look like that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Samyeongdang had turned into a wooden gong and was making a rattling sound.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[That… I spent too much of my probability.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In this game, death didn't mean the disappearance of the incarnation body. However, the thing that remained unchanged was the number of resources consumed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Osu?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yiiip!</p>
<p class="orv_line">Just like Samyeongdang, Osu died in the last game and he was now almost as small as a guinea pig. It seemed they had overconsumed their probability and energy in the last game. The constellations of the same rank had significant differences in level due to the quantity and quality of their accumulated stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Han Myungoh who opened his mouth. "I-I can't do it anymore."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Myungoh had run away safely until the end of the first game. He was like a lizard as his cut off leg slowly grew. Nevertheless, his face had aged 10 years during this short period.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's fine. You've worked hard."</p>
<p class="orv_line">No matter how much their power was suppressed, the opponents were still constellations. He had faced the status of a constellation for more than an hour and any normal incarnation would collapse.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The small consolation was that the Breaking the Sky Master was unharmed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Woof woof!</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the first game, the Breaking the Sky Master helped Yoo Joonghyuk hunt one of the constellations. Me, Yoo Joonghyuk, Jang Hayoung and the Breaking the Sky Master. Now there were only the four of us in the team. Understandably, four wasn't enough to win the game.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth. "I will try to call additional power."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you have any constellations?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't know if reinforcements will come in time. I'll just put them on the list for now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I had no idea of who he would call. Did Yoo Joonghyuk have any connections during this period?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk continued talking, "We have to change our plan in the second round. Our positions as well."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Why? Can't we do it like the last round?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">At Jang Hayoung's question, Yoo Joonghyuk glanced at me and silently shook his head. I ended up answering instead. "Yoo Joonghyuk's attribute is powerful but it isn't invincible."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…It seems almost invincible."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It was because the constellations didn't know much about this game."</p>
<p class="orv_line">From the second round, the penalty on stats would be slightly released. The constellations who had looked down on us would start to collect attributes and skills related to the game and would narrow the gap using an enormous amount of coins. Yoo Joonghyuk might have Ruler of Amusement but there was a limit to him alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pondered for a moment before declaring to the party members. "I have an idea."</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">"We have decided to cooperate with the Bercan Industrial Complex."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…Are you telling me to join forces with Papyrus?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"It isn't the time to cover hot water with cold water."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A deep sigh emerged from Duke Melledon who resembled a rhinoceros. All the constellations on the battlefield had been destroyed by a single incarnation. They were caught off guard and hit in the back or had a sword piercing their feet. There were even constellations who fought against him one on one and were defeated.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We can't let them win this time. You should know this."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Don't worry. I was careless in the last round but this time will be different.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Founder of Humanity, Manu gritted his teeth as he raised the Primitive Spear.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I have learnt enough about this game.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, messages had been coming from the air for a long time.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Founder of Humanity' has purchased the 'Special Game Talent' skill!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Thunder Eating Bird' has purchased the 'One Week Game Master' item!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The dokkaebis were grinning widely at the suddenly buying binge.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Oh my, constellations! Going to this extent…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations didn't like this expression on the dokkaebis but the more important thing was their pride, which had been crushed by the incarnation.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Let's go.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The game started and the constellations moved in unison. The influence of the attributes and items was great. They used the terrain to cover their actions and were fully aware of how their stigmas and skills were applied to this game.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The all-rounder of the team was the incomprehensible incarnation. If they killed him, the game would end.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Over there.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Thunder Eating Bird glide and created strong winds. Amidst the wind-swept bushes, the owner of the sword was revealed. It was Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Now!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment that Duke Melledon gave the signal, four constellations rushed at once.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[It will be different from before!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Founder of Humanity swung his spear, followed by a ray from King Oedipus. Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't avoid the attack and blood flowed from his forearm. The shadow of General of Vanara split up and pursued the gap revealed by Yoo Joonghyuk. A sharp rod brushed past Yoo Joonghyuk's side. There was the sound of flesh being hit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now the power of the constellations was limited to 30%. That damage that Yoo Joonghyuk received was different from before. However, Yoo Joonghyuk held up well despite the constellations' onslaught.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…What? Why isn't he dead?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Duke Melledon felt it was strange and used a skill to figure out Yoo Joonghyuk's physical state. Surprisingly, Yoo Joonghyuk still had more than 70% of his health remaining.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"T-This guy's health is a bit strange. Don't tell me…!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then the screams of the constellations were heard from the rear.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">The enemies probably believed that Yoo Joonghyuk was an all-rounder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Breaking the Sky Master!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Breaking the Sky Master flew forward at my signal. Like a spear of light dividing the space, the Breaking the Sky Master penetrated the torso of the Thunder Eating Bird who was aiming at Yoo Joonghyuk. The battered bird fell down and the Breaking the Sky Master tore at the bird's torso with her fangs.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As soon as our position was exposed, the nearby constellations started to run this way. There were a total of three constellations rushing over. The long distance damage dealer Jang Hayoung received an agility penalty so there was no chance of winning when it was close combat. Even so, the situation was different this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja, buy me 10 seconds."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Understood."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung took a stance, his left hand forward while his right fist was pulled back to his shoulder as he started gathering strength.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Jang Hayoung has used the points earned to unseal a specific skill.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The helper 'Jang Hayoung' is preparing the ultimate.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In this game, stigmas and skills over a certain power level were treated as 'ultimate'. In addition, the ultimate could only be released with points obtained in the game. Jang Hayoung used the points we had just earned as an assistant.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The helper 'Jang Hayoung' has activated Breaking the Sky Force Punch Lv. 10!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was the sound of a cannon bursting and a mighty wind was created as Jang Hayoung's fist tore through the space. The wind crushed the ray of light coming from King Oedipus and blew away two of the running constellations.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Breaking the Sky Force Punch. I had seen it in Ways of Survival. It was a technique made out of boredom by the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint who pursued the path of the sword.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…I didn't know she could make such a powerful technique when bored.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The helper 'Jang Hayoung' has killed the helper 'Thunder Eating Bird'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The helper 'Jang Hayoung' has neutralized the helper 'General of Vanara'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I thought it would be a success just defeating one constellation. Yet one constellation died and one suffered a fatal wound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Didn't I say that I was a hard worker?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung laughed despite obviously overdoing it. Even Jang Hayoung would find it hard to achieve such rapid growth. Maybe he made a deal with the Unidentified Wall.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Kill him!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The enraged constellations ran in a messy manner. Jang Hayoung also ran towards them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kim Dokja! Go! Do it according to the plan!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">If I tried to save Jang Hayoung here, the time would be delayed. This time, it was me who had the 'sentence'. Shortly after I ran towards the gorge, a scream was heard from behind me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The helper 'Breaking the Sky Master' has been killed!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The helper 'Jang Hayoung' has been killed!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…Shit. Fortunately, Yoo Joonghyuk was still in good shape. Whether he was a tanker or all-rounder, Yoo Joonghyuk was Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I went down to the bottom of the canyon and dark fog started to pour into the vicinity. I had calculated this. If the fog had begun, the 'monster' would soon appear here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then a constellation was felt from above the rocky terrain.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You are quick, Demon King of Salvation.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was an unexpected move. Melledon's side should be tied up with Yoo Joonghyuk. How did they already reach here? The moment I saw the shadow on the canyon rocks, I realized what happened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was the shadow of a giant mummy and a goddess with a pointed scorpion tail. They were constellations of the Bercan who hadn't been seen in the last game.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'The Last Pharaoh' Cleopatra and the 'Scorpion Goddess' Serket…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Surprisingly, King Oedipus of the Melledon camp could also be seen. I smiled bitterly. "…I see. You have decided to join forces?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Serket's tail swelled up and fired a stinger towards me. I was about to avoid the attack when old bandages released by the Last Pharaoh wrapped around my ankles. Close range damage dealers were vulnerable to long range damage dealers. My movements were limited so it was obvious that I would die like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">King Oedipus seemed ready to finish things. I reflexively curled up. A powerful storm swept over my body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could hear the laughter of the constellations. It was a laugh that was convinced of my death from this blow.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have converted the points won in the last game!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have unlocked a certain skill with the points!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly raised my body in the dust. The laughter disappeared from the constellations' faces as they saw me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Poked Out His Eyes' is astonished!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Scorpion Goddess' has wide eyes!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The white fur wrapped around me protected me without a single scratch.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' has been activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It had been a long time since I used the third bookmark. I had been hesitant to use this bookmark for quite some time. I didn't think it was polite to my dokkaebi.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your understanding of this person is very high and the skill abilities are strengthened!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Beast King's Sensitivity Lv. 10 (+1)' has been activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt the warm of Biyoo curled up in my arms. The third bookmark, Beast Master Shin Yoosung. I looked up at the constellations on the canyon with the white fur wrapped around me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The participant 'Demon King of Salvation' will receive the position compensation effect.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't have the same attack power as Yoo Joonghyuk. Nor could I learn things quickly like Jang Hayoung. However, I had something better than them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm sorry but I'm the all-rounder in this game."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Demon King Selection would end in the second round.</p>
