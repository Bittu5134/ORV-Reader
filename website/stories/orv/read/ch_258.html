            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 258: Ep. 48 - Entrance as a Character, IV</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">One day, there was a constellation who left such a remark.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Every story has a flaw. This means that all stories can be completed." 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The legendary story 'Distorting Things as One Pleases'. This story was made by the narrative-grade constellation who left behind that remark.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Distorting Things as One Pleases' is searching for the target of the distortion.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I got up and moved away from the ruined building. I could see three constellations chasing me through the dust clouds. It was originally four but I didn't know where the last one went.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Kuaaaah…]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Gi ve me the sto ry co re.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I was surrounded by the incarnation bodies. There was one giant snake that reminded me of Orochi and one giant field mouse. The last one was a fiery dog resembling a Cerberus. The Mass Production Maker had told me something during my visit to the Gourmet Association.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Not all constellations have a noble character.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some of the constellations would build up stories like me to become constellations while others would lend themselves to the 'authority' of other constellations. In some cases, they might not have accumulated excellent stories but they were lucky enough to fall into an advantageous area and become a constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What if I don't want to give it to you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the case with the guys in front of me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Nouveau Riche Snake Boss' is staring at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">They were those who received the patronage of constellations or 'fortunately' became constellations by eating other beginner constellations or incarnations.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' is coveting your nails.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames' is looking at the surrounding constellations.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I knew I would eventually bump into them from the moment they appeared in front of me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many constellations are looking forward to your battle!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is looking forward to your performance!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel the hot gaze of the stars. They would be curious. I hadn't fought properly since becoming a narrative-grade constellation. Dokgak spoke from the air.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Haha, you are still stupid… are you really going to fight?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I listened to Dokgak's words and gritted my teeth. The three constellations in front of me had exactly the same level of combat power as me. It was due to Dokgak's penalty. A penalty where everyone in the scenario had the same combat power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I used Way of the Wind to avoid the poisonous liquid that poured out of the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss' mouth. At almost the same time, the Nail-Eating Rat swiped his nails towards me. The moment I rolled around on the ground, the surroundings were filled with the flames of the Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I moved around the flames and pulled out my newest thing. This was a fight that couldn't be won if we faced each other with our incarnation bodies. This was if it was only the force of the incarnation body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">They might be animals but they were still historical-grade constellations. Originally, I couldn't look at them with this skill.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The effect of 'Looked into the Abyss' has increased the effect of all your skills.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Character List' is amplified!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This time was different.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You will be able to view constellations who are lower rated than you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<p class="orv_line">.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can now read the constellation information of 'Nouveau Riche Snake Boss'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can now read the constellation information of 'Nail-Eating Rat'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You can now read the constellation information of 'Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at the characteristics of these guys. Of course, it didn't make sense to simply identify the stats or attributes information when combat power was set at a certain point.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The effect of Character List will randomly output a list of the constellation's stories.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A list of their stories quickly crossed my eyes.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Snake Eating Other Snakes.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Rat Turning Into a Person.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Loyalty Towards the Master.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Predator of the Weak.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the meantime, countless attacks were focused on me. The fist of the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss grazed past my shoulders, my body flew through the air from an attack by the Nail-Eating Rat and my skin was burnt by the flames of the Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your reading speed has increased due to the attribute effect.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't back down and kept reading their list of stories. They were constellations and had an excellent number of stories. Some were legendary while most were historical-grade.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Rat Who Stole the Words of the Night.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Fear of Rodents]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Mine is Mine, Yours is Mine Too.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Towards Plandas.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<p class="orv_line">How long had it been? My legs were paralyzed and the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss wound around my body. My vision was literally reversed as my body was captured by him.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Gi ve me the Sto ry Co re.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The strong grip on my body made by bones feel twisted. It was a mighty power that the Infinite Dimension Space Coat couldn't bear. Story fragments fell down from my body like crumbs.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellations who love cruel stories are excited.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some of the constellations want to see your body torn apart.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The eyes of the snake changed at the indirect messages of the constellations. Having the name of 'constellation' didn't mean all of them were on the same level.</p>
<p class="orv_line">They were more like incarnations. They were watched by other constellations and received coins from them.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I have one question… Why do you want to live like this?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Nail-Eating Rat raised his head with a sound.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Kuooooh…?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled bitterly. Well, I couldn't afford to think about such things. I had to survive these guys.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I feel sorry for you. Right? Usually a constellation should have a 'king's story'…"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Distorting Things as One Pleases' is paying attention to your words.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Whether it was a snake, a rat, a dog or a human… Those who steadily built up their stories would have a story of a 'king' at the very least. However, these guys have no such stories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…You have always fought against beings weaker than yourself and don't have such stories."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Wh at non sense…!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The next moment, a bright light rose from my body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Distorting Things as One Pleases' has found a story to distort.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The story, Distorting Things as One Pleases. This story didn't have the power to improve my combat power.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Distorting Things as One Pleases' is starting the story distortion.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Instead, it could wake up the potential of stories that hadn't yet found their true power. The direction didn't matter.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'King of a Kingless world' has been distorted!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'King of a Kingless world' is starting the story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt the power of the story seething deep inside my body. The muscles in both arms swelled up. I gripped the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss that was wrapped around my body. The snake screamed in my hands.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The world without a king is now here. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A huge magic power escaped and the story started to speak for itself. The reason I checked the constellations' list of stories was simple. It was to use this power.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 He was born rejecting all thrones in his black world. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A brilliant light rose from the sword in my hands. The Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword. It was the sword used to destroy the Absolute Throne and the weapon used in the story King of a Kingless World. The weapon responded to my story and regained its original shape.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Reign over all beings who aren't kings. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[W-Wait! This strength…!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The fact that our combat power was the same didn't mean the 'status' of the stories is the same.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Even if the density and number of stories were low, I was also a constellation. Dokgak should've properly recognized this fact.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Some constellations are admiring your story application!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellations of the Big Dipper are paying attention to you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Dokgak was bewildered and he frantically tried to manipulate the scenario. However, now it was too late to change the sub scenario. He had already exhausted a lot of probability because of the excessive sub scenario.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' is preparing to turn its tail and run.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The rat realized the unusual signs and turned around first. However, I wouldn't miss a single one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Stop."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The effect of the story 'King of a Kingless World' is activated.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[In front of your majesty, all beings who failed to qualify as kings must bow.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Kuaaaah!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Eeeek!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There were powerful sparks and the bodies of the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss and Nail-Eating Rat became stiff. The Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames was already on the ground from the moment he saw my story.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Grrrr. D… don't co me.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As I approached, the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss wriggled on the ground. Only those who had the story of a 'king' could resist this story.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is pleased.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">As the king of the monkeys and king of the 32 Demon Realm watched over me, the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword moved.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Kuaaaaaack!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">One blow. Two blows. I struck the head of the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss a few times. The scales of the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss weren't easily destroyed. The flesh of the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss was cut by the Purest Sword Force and his blood splashed, turning the surrounding land red. The Nouveau Riche Snake Boss let out several pained screams before falling quiet.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellations of the absolute good system are frowning at your cruelty.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I pulled the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword out of the head of the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The demon king, 'Silver Claws Owl' is rejoicing in your execution.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[2,000 coins have been sponsored.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations didn't know what was really cruel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You should've been prepared if you coveted my position."</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was a warning to the constellations. It was a warning that they shouldn't interfere with the giant story. I watched the sky and waved the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have killed the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss's incarnation body.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have acquired some of the stories of the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was the power of the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword that could cut off the connection between constellation and incarnation body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Nouveau Riche Snake Boss' has fallen into a deep sleep with a scream.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss would never return to an incarnation body. Then I looked at the Nail-Eating Rat. Soon after, the Nail-Eating Rat received the same fate.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is delighting in your madness.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking at you with sad eyes.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I brushed the blood of my cheeks and looked at the last remaining constellation. The Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames was trembling uncontrollably while his head drooped down. The flames that covered his body had already disappeared.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The only thing that remained on the dog's body were the black burn stains from protecting its master. I recalled his list of stories. This dog was different from the other two in the Twelve Zodiacs.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames' is pledging allegiance to you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at the panting dog and hesitated for a moment. Certain constellations would be disappointed if I didn't kill the dog here. However… Other constellations aiming for me were running in the distance.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The story 'Distorting Things as One Pleases' has come to an end.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I had used an excessive amount of magic power and needed to recover. I put away my sword and climbed onto the dog.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's go to the Yoo Joonghyuk Industrial Complex."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As if waiting, the dog started taking strong steps. The scenery passed quickly and I looked up at the sky.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The stars in the night sky seemed to be flowing to different places. Some chose to watch and others chose to take part. Everyone started to draw the trail of the story according to their respective desires.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The real Demon King Selection would soon begin.</p>
