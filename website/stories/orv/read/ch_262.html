            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 262: Ep. 49 - The Best at Something, IV</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">"…What?" The surprised Jang Hayoung's eyes widened.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"This is why I wanted to buy time."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has killed the helper 'Thunder Eating Bird'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Yoo Joonghyuk - Kim Dokja' industrial complex has won one point.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk falling through the air and the bewildered constellations could be seen.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Poked Out His Eyes' is crying out with surprise!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'General of Vanara' is showing hostility towards Yoo Joonghyuk!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many constellations are amazed by Yoo Joonghyuk's movements.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't panicked at all despite the attacks. His movements seemed like he had grasped all the terrain features of this place. By the time the furious King Oedipus swung his staff, Yoo Joonghyuk had already disappeared.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Where did he go?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Find him! He must be nearby!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations moved and searched around but they couldn't find where Yoo Joonghyuk had disappeared to. I hid behind a tree with Jang Hayoung and watched the scene.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One of Yoo Joonghyuk's attributes was 'Pro Gamer'. This guy received an overwhelming advantage and adaptability in all games. This game was still in the early stages and stats were limited.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before the constellations were accustomed to the game, this 'first round' was a better stage for us than anyone else. The opponents might be constellations but it wasn't easy for them to face off against the current Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[There he is!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The General of Vanara let out a wind blade from his mouth towards a bush and shouted. There was a loud noise and the surrounding terrain was cut. However, this time, Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't present. The confused General of Vanara retreated and a flash of light emerged from the dirt on the ground. It was too late to avoid it.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has killed the helper 'General of Vanara!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yes, Yoo Joonghyuk should catch at least two.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Yoo Joonghyuk - Kim Dokja' industrial complex has won two points.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has started to blow blood onto the battlefield!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung pointed towards Yoo Joonghyuk and shivered. "What is this? A monster?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It is similar. He is the best pro gamer in South Korea."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was talking about the setting of Ways of Survival. In the distance, the General of Vanara's body was split in half and he disappeared. The rules of the game were applied so he wouldn't really die, but the mental damage was significant.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is pleased.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' has sponsored 20,000 coins to the incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The true name of the General of Vanara was Hanuman, a monkey hero of Indian mythology. Due to the characteristic of both being monkeys, the two constellations didn't have a good relationship with each other. I guess it was true.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Shit, chase him!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk killed two people and hid in the rocky gorge this time. Then one more enemy appeared.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Founder of Humanity' wants to show an example to his arrogant descendant.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The constellation who was close to a primitive man. The Founder of Humanity, Manu. I forgot that he was on the side fo the Melledon Industrial Complex.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Maybe we should help."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Manu of Vedas was a narrative-level constellation. He might be low in level among the narrative-grade constellations but it was absolutely disadvantageous for Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk had already consumed a lot of mobility and magic power killing two constellations. He might have the attribute of Pro Gamer but it was too much for him from now on…</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has activated the 'Sentinel Golem's Blessing!']</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk stood on a rocky highland area and aimed a giant bow.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The star relic 'Robin Hood's Strongbow' has maximized the user's accuracy!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This bastard, when did he get this? It was something that could only be obtained from the 15th scenario area, Lugratia. Intangible arrows flew towards the body of King Oedipus.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Keok…!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Of course, Yoo Joonghyuk's advantage wasn't only swordsmanship. This guy could use all types of weapons with the Weapons Mastery skill.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You! You're not a closer range damage dealer?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In addition, Yoo Joonghyuk's position was 'all-rounder'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' will receive the position compensation effect.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">While this game was in progress, Yoo Joonghyuk wouldn't be penalized for using any types of weapons.</p>
<div class="orv_image"><img src="../../../assets/images/262 - While this game was in progress, Yoo Joonghyuk wouldn't be penalized for using any types of weapons.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></div>
<div class="orv_notice"><p>* Official novel illustration (canonical)</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I will kill you! This thing, this thing…!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">King Oedipus screamed as holes were drilled into his body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"We should go help!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Wait a minute."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Making clumsy movements in the current circumstances would only hinder Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Immediately after launching Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, Yoo Joonghyuk's operation flowed into my head like a movie trailer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jang Hayoung frowned at my flippant smile and asked, "…What is it?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That bastard is scarier than I thought."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk didn't waste a single second when he came here. The evidence was the Sentinel Golem's Blessing that was embedded in his body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Sentinel Golem's Blessing has started to accumulate!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sentinel golem inhabited the outskirts of the gorge and gave a 'fainting' buff effect. However, this buff had one condition. The person had to succeed in 20 attacks before the 'fainting' effect was produced. Now there were approximately 10 metres between Yoo Joonghyuk and King Oedipus.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[This thing, this thing…!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">King Oedipus jumped and tried to aim for Yoo Joonghyuk. King Oedipus' body hardened from the ankle and he collapsed like a stone statue.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The helper 'Poked Out His Eyes' has fainted.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The duration of the fainting was three seconds. These three seconds were enough time for Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has killed the helper 'Poked Out His Eyes'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The name of the participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is widely circulated on the battlefield!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The 'Yoo Joonghyuk - Kim Dokja' industrial complex has won three points.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Three… I honestly admired him. The appearance of the dying King Oedipus was unrealistic. It was hard to believe he was the constellation who threatened me at the constellation banquet.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Impertinent fellow!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, the fight hadn't ended yet. Before Yoo Joonghyuk could sigh, the furious Founder of Humanity rushed forward. Yoo Joonghyuk was now lacking physical strength and magic power.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Primitive Spear belonging to the Founder of Humanity dug into a gap that Yoo Joonghyuk revealed. It looked similar to a stone tool but the power it contained was enormous.</p>
<p class="orv_line">On the other hand, Yoo Joonghyuk was also tough. He twisted his back with a flexible motion and at nearly the same time, he swung his weapon. The spear collided with the sword and a sharp sound was heard. The distinctive yellow aura that was only for transcendents was wrapped around Yoo Joonghyuk's Black Heavenly Demon Sword. It opposed the blue 'status' woven around the Primitive Spear wielded by Manu.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[These martial arts! They were skills left behind by worms. It still seems useful.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a situation where participants could only use 10% of their power. Manu seemed unable to accurately determine the amount of force he could control. There were dozens of exchanges in a flash and Manu laughed like he was having fun.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You are pretty good human. I have seen countless transcendents but none as strong as you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"You haven't seen my master."</p>
<p class="orv_line">A power similar to martial arts emerged from Manu's spear. Manu had mastered almost every type of talent that a human could gain. Originally, the present Yoo Joonghyuk wouldn't be able to defeat Manu. Still, the balance of power was even because Manu hadn't fought such a long battle for a long time.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[How interesting! I haven't competed with more than 10 blows since becoming a constellation!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The forcible equilibrium balance maintained this confrontation. I grabbed Jang Hayoung who was about to pop out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That jerk will die if this continues!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The same thing would happen even if we popped out. I wanted to use Electrification to run out and cut off Manu's neck.</p>
<p class="orv_line">However, I had to endure it for now. If it turned out like I thought, Yoo Joonghyuk would soon welcome an opportunity. All I needed was time. Just time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Jang Hayoung, send a message through the wall."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What? To who?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The Founder of Humanity."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh? The guy currently fighting with Yoo Joonghyuk? Ah…!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The clever Jang Hayoung realized what I was planning. Jang Hayoung turned on the Unidentified Wall and wrote a message. Soon after, Manu's baffled voice rang out.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What? These messages…!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't need to ask to know the situation that Manu was facing now. Perhaps countless messages sent by the '15 year old schoolgirl' were popping up like pop-up windows in his field of view.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[These ridiculous tactics!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Manu hesitated and a white light started to emerge from Yoo Joonghyuk's body. I had seen this bright light before. It happened when Jung Heewon evolved to the Judge of Destruction. Then when Lee Hyunsung learnt Great Mountain Smash…</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has reached the moment of attribute evolution!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The attribute 'Pro Gamer' of the character Yoo Joonghyuk has evolved!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Attribute evolution. Finally, Yoo Joonghyuk's second attribute had come to full bloom. Manu rushed forward and wielded his spear. At the same time, the dazzling light burst from Yoo Joonghyuk's body.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I watched the fascinating scene and recalled what Lee Jihye said in the latter half of Ways of Survival.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "Master has countless attributes. Hmm…the best is naturally Regressor. Other than that, Master of the Panacea and Enemy of Gods and Demons are excellent… huh? Which one is the most envious attribute? Ahaha, it is naturally…" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Manu's spearsmanship swept over Yoo Joonghyuk in vain.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 "The Ruler of Amusement. It is that." 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_image"><img src="../../../assets/images/262 - The Ruler of Amusement. It is that.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></div>
<div class="orv_notice"><p>* Unofficial fan illustration (non-canonical)</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk slowly opened his eyes as he made the same expression I had constantly read about.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 At that moment, Yoo Joonghyuk seemed to understand everything about this game. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps in Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes, all of Manu's attacks looked like a combination of 0s and 1s.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the legendary attribute, Ruler of Amusement. As long as this stage was a 'game', Yoo Joonghyuk was closer to a deity than any other constellation in the world.</p>
