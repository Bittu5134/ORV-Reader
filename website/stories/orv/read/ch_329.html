            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 329: Ep. 62 - God's Enemy, II</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Break the scenario? What are you saying…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The people made expressions that showed they didn't understand. It was natural. There was no way they thought they could break the scenario. The scenario had become a condition of life for them.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[You are a splendid constellation! Do you think you can contend with Olympus?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I turned after hearing someone's voice and saw a familiar big man. He had a bushy beard and held a long spear. It was a constellation I knew. "That's right."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Mwahaha! If you don't mind, I'd like to ask for your name.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I am the Demon King of Salvation."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Demon King of Salvation. Some of the incarnations and constellations who heard my modifier immediately responded. "Is it the Demon King's Selection…?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"T-The demon king who knocked down Surya!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The man with the big spear came forward and said.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I am called 'Protector of Changban'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Protector of Changban! It is Zhang Fei!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Zhang Fei struck his massive chest.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I want to help you. I didn't want to play this childish game but now I'm getting heated up!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He threw away the items harvested from Olympus' theme park. It was the head of a young hydra, a golden apple and fake golden fleece.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded and said, "Good."</p>
<p class="orv_line">If Zhang Fei had this equipment, he would definitely be a big power. However, it wasn't enough.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The hidden scenario 'Myth Subversion' has affected the main scenario.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I glanced around at the other incarnations and constellations and stated, "Now, choose."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations looked between me, the terrible giants and Argo crossing the sea.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you want to be stuck to the back of a giant nebula and be their limbs for a lifetime? Or do you want to be the master of a new 'myth' along with the mythical giants."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The contents of the 'main scenario' that you and your nebula received will be updated!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_window">
<h3 class="orv_window_title">[Main scenario #60 ― Gigantomachia]</h3>
<p>Category: Main</p>
<p>Difficulty level: SSS+</p>
<p>Clear Conditions: The ancient giants have come to the Gigantomachia battlefield. You can join the battlefield by taking the side of the 'giants' or 'Olympus'. Cut the neck of the enemy leader and declare the advent of a new myth to the Star Stream!</p>
<p>Time Limit: ―</p>
<p>Compensation: A new giant story, ???</p>
<p>Failure: Partial disappearance of the 'giant story'.</p>
<p>* If the enemy's incarnation body is destroyed, the corresponding scenario will end.</p>
<p>* Each faction has two leaders.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">The moment the scenario updated, a green arrow flashed over my head.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You already belong to a force.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are one of the two leaders in charge of the 'giant' forces.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations around me were silent. They had probably received the updated scenario.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is delighting in this spectacle.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is delighting in your suffering.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is wondering about your strategy.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then the bombardment started from the sea. Han Sooyoung's voice was heard behind me. "Kim Dokja! How long are you going to stand there? Do you want to just watch?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I drew my sword and descended from the shoulder of a giant. "Let's start."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"How are we going to fight? Our power is overwhelmingly lacking."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung's words were true. I wouldn't say it was 'overwhelming' but less than 10 giants had passed through the portal with me. Furthermore, Briareus of the Hecatoncheires was a core power but he hadn't yet appeared on the field. Perhaps he was the other 'leader'.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Kill the giants.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A true voice emerged from somewhere and the human heroes leapt from Argo to attack the giants.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Stage Transformation of Gigantomachia is occurring.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There were sparks and the surroundings changed. The ancient battlefield. It was the land of massacre where the first Gigantomachia occurred.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The constellations of Olympus came flying through the air. Most of them were historical-grade but once they joined forces and attacked the giants, the situation suddenly tilted.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The supreme giants will kneel down to the combined forces of the heroes and gods. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The giants were kneeling down one by one before the combined efforts of the constellations and heroes. My group tried to help the giants but we were blocked by the shells coming from the sea.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung exclaimed, "I think we have to do something about that story weapon!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The story weapon, Argo. The ship of the Olympus heroes was launching shells that contained enormous magic power. It was difficult to even approach the sea. Of course, it was expected. "Have you forgotten? Who we have."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared at a girl standing among the party members. "…Me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">To be exact, I looked at the constellation behind Lee Jihye.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye shouted, "…Are you crazy? You want me to deal with that?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Olympus' Argo was much bigger than Lee Jihye's Ghost Fleet. It was the size difference between a patrol ship and a destroyer. It was natural to think it was impossible.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You can do it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I knew. Lee Jihye could indeed do it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You can definitely do it if you are with your sponsor."</p>
<p class="orv_line">As the constellations of the Korean Peninsula watched, the Maritime War God was looking up at the sky. A constellation who had been confined to the Korean Peninsula for a long time. He had to carry the name of the country on his back. The constellation who had to remain a symbol of the nation he dedicated his life to.</p>
<p class="orv_line">One day, Goryeo's First Sword had said: Among the historical-grade constellations of the Korean Peninsula, only the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare can compete with me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then why did Yi Sunsin remain at the historical-grade despite Goryeo's First Sword become a narrative-grade constellation?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is looking at his fellow people.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was because he refused to be narrative-grade.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Seo Ae Il Pil' wants 'Maritime War God' to fight for himself.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was the moment when a historical-grade constellation became narrative-grade. The moment when a single constellation left his nation and moved towards his own path. A dazzling radiance emerged from Lee Jihye's body.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is opening his status.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Duke of Loyalty and Warfare released himself, as if revealing everything about him.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Star Stream is staring at the constellation 'Maritime War God'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The sky of the scenario looked down at the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare. Like a seasoned actor who had been hiding his capabilities, the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare under the sky was magnificent and bold. It was a spirit that didn't retreat or feel fear.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Many constellations are surprised by the status of the Maritime War God!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">After a long time, the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare was finally leaving the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Star Stream has accepted the promotion of Maritime War God.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Maritime War God' has become a narrative-grade constellation.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Jihye." The opening of Gigantomachia started with the promotion of the sea admiral. "Smash it all."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye was surrounded by the spirit of the Maritime War God and raised her sword.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The character 'Lee Jihye' has activated the stigma 'Ghost Fleet Lv. 10!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The status of the sponsor has risen and the destructive power of the Ghost Fleet is rising rapidly!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">12 ships appeared at the shoreline. The ships had already grown to the size of a destroyer.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Those who seek death shall live. Those who seek life shall die. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The cannons of the 12 ships fired simultaneously. The number of enemy shells that never ceased firing slowly started to change. The front of Argo was crumbling. The number of shells dropped sharply and there was the sound of the hull exploding.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The solid Argo was shaking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">We equipped ourselves to defend against the shells and moved our feet. We cut down the Olympians running towards the giants and moved forward. Maybe they thought this couldn't continue anymore and the heroes of Argo came out.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Everybody land!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The intense true voice was heard from Argo's expedition leader, Wind Expedition King. Argo' expedition leader, Jason.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[The giants can't stop humanity and gods from joining together! The winner of this war is already fixed!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The army poured out along with this shout. I took the lead while speaking to the faltering group members. "There is no need to be afraid. We aren't giants."</p>
<p class="orv_line">We weren't giants. In other words, Stage Transformation didn't have an influence on us.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The large Jason came this way and a man on our side ran towards him.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'll take this big one."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Lee Hyunsung. Lee Hyunsung collided with Jason with a tremendous amount of force and bellowed as they had a battle of strength.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Haaaaaap!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Jason was surprised by the tremendous strength that forced him to be pushed back. In the latter half of Ways of Survival, Lee Hyunsung wasn't pushed by an incarnation or constellation in strength.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Synchronization with the constellation 'Master of Steel' has increased!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung's upper body was covered by a shell of steel. The level of Lee Hyunsung's Steel Transformation was extremely high. His body wasn't hurt at all despite being punched by a hero.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the sky, Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung were flying on the dragon. Shin Yoosung avoided the heroes with dragon slaying stories and fired a breath. The sea was instantly poisoned and the enemies were cut by Lee Gilyoung's insect kings. Lee Seolhwa used poison against the heroes while Han Sooyoung used the black flames and blocked the constellations of Olympus.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now they all had the ability to deal with historical-grade constellations. The 10 or so nebula members were fighting against the constellations of a mighty nebula.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The incarnations observing the situation in the back were shocked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What? Olympus seems to be pushed…?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"By that small nebula?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was the effect I had intended. The battle was still in its infancy. I had to appeal with strength to bring in reinforcements. However, the god of victory still wasn't on our side.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…It finally appeared. I looked at the 20 metres high monster filling my field of view. It wasn't a human, no matter how I looked.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gleaming golden armour. A cloak made of lion leather wrapped around it. Those who knew Greek mythology couldn't not know his name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Some of the giants shrieked at the majestic appearance.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Heracles…!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The hero's 'status', that even the 12 Gods were reluctant to go against, dominated the entire battlefield.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked up as a dark shadow covered the surrounding area and smiled bitterly. If I wanted to deal with this monster then I had to call a monster as well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It took me so long to get here. Naturally, I wouldn't withdraw from here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The sword designed to cut a sleeping giant." I quietly stated. "Now, descend upon this place."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Come, Kim Namwoon.</p>
