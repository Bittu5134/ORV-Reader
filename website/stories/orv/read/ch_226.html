        <article class="orv_main">
            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 226: Ep. 42 - Asmodeus, VI</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">My hands were trembling, but I took a deep breath and regained my composure. No, Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't have died. Above all, the message that caught my attention was proof of that.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are currently waiting for the next main scenario.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Based on common sense, Yoo Joonghyuk shouldn't be given the exile penalty. It was because Yoo Joonghyuk would've entered a new scenario like me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There might be variations for individual scenarios, but he became a duke as soon as I did. It meant that like me, Yoo Joonghyuk was a 'demon king candidate'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There is currently a delay in the compensation due to an error in the Star Stream system.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">However, there was this one message. It was very rare to acquire a story or achievement through 'impersonation' in the Star Stream. This time, Yoo Joonghyuk and I impersonated each other and made achievements in each other's name.</p>
<p class="orv_line">What if the main scenario of the Star Stream was twisted because of this? I entered the main scenario safely, but what if Yoo Joonghyuk didn't enter? Was that why the exile penalty had begun?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…Do you have a glass of water?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Aileen stared at me with disbelieving eyes for a moment. "Don't pull out the catheter again while I'm gone."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Aileen left the room and I calmly reexamined the situation. I had to be composed. It wasn't clear whether Yoo Joonghyuk had died or not. It was likely that he had been killed by the start of the exile penalty just prior to the release of Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, but absolute certainty was a taboo in the Star Stream. I first needed to confirm Yoo Joonghyuk's life or death properly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Biyoo."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Biyoo had expanded the channel to the Gilobat side. If Biyoo helped, I might be able to see the area using the eyes of a constellation.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Biyoo. Do you hear me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did something happen? There was no response from Biyoo. I couldn't even hear the messages from other constellations. I felt uneasy for a moment. What happened to Biyoo while I was away?</p>
<p class="orv_line">…Huh? I listened quietly, and could hear Biyoo breathing near me. Biyoo's transparent body was lying on my chest, fast asleep.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sighed with relief. I would've been devastated if something had happened to Biyoo.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…I'm sorry." I stroked Biyoo's head. According to Ways of Survival, a dokkaebi must sleep for at least half a day when it was just born. I was sleeping so it wasn't strange for her to have fallen asleep too.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a situation where Biyoo had exhausted her strength from overworking.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I decided to use the second method.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been activated!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then my temples started throbbing.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The skill is cancelled due to accumulated damage.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…Damn, this didn't work either. It seemed that I had suffered a huge blow when my link with Yoo Joonghyuk was severed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the end, I picked up the smartphone again. It was the first time I felt so helpless. I didn't know if Yoo Joonghyuk was dead or alive, and the only thing I could do was read the novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">No, don't think like this. Kim Dokja, please wake up. You've survived so far thanks to this novel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I bit my lips and opened Ways of Survival again. Everything came from this story. Thus, the answer would be in the story.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The attribute effect has increased 'speed reading'!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I read the book with wide eyes, not missing a single word or sentence.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 'At that time, we shouldn't have pretended to support the Demon King Asmodeus'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was hard to see it as Yoo Joonghyuk and I pretending to support Asmodeus this time. I might've deceived him but in the end, there was a nuance that he would still cooperate with us. I couldn't be sure that Yoo Joonghyuk was dead with this sentence alone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 13th round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The 14th round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk's regressions continued. It took longer than before, but his spirit was gradually worn down by the continuous regressions.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 'It is hard'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 18th round.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 'I want to quit now'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 21st round.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 'Dammit, dammit, dammit!' 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…</p>
<p class="orv_line">I read about Yoo Joonghyuk's despair and also felt my heart burning. As time went by, Yoo Joonghyuk returned to his original pessimistic form. A regressor who survived every regression using the principles of only thinking about himself.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 'I can't change anything'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He went back, went back and went back again. In the second half of the novel, there was no big difference with the Ways of Survival that I had read before. Apart from the first half that I influenced, Yoo Joonghyuk made similar mistakes and regained similar tendencies.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 'Damn, a few more times…' 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I had spent several months with Yoo Joonghyuk, but I was only able to have this much influence on the novel. I wanted to reach out to the frustrated Yoo Joonghyuk but Yoo Joonghyuk was in a place which I couldn't reach. The 25th, 26th, 27th rounds… Yoo Joonghyuk constantly repeated the regressions and I had to stop reading.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was painful to read. The original Ways of Survival was a story like this. How was I able to read all 3,149 chapters?</p>
<p class="orv_line">Due to my irregular breathing, Biyoo attached to my chest was moving uncomfortably.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I remembered the page number before scrolling down to the bottom. It might be burdensome to follow this story right now, but there was something I had to check first.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Did Yoo Joonghyuk reach the proper ending in the first revision? Did the author write the epilogue?</p>
<p class="orv_line">The screen hitched badly while I was scrolling due to the poor performance of the smartphone. How long was I scrolling down? I finally reached the spot where the original ending should be. However, I only found a huge void.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Currently being edited. ㅠㅠ 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There was a one line message. I was swept away by two different emotions.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…Haha."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The emoticon that followed the word 'edited' angered me but some of the possibilities that came from the message made me excited. This story could still be changed. There was a way even if Yoo Joonghyuk was dead. Somehow I had to bring him back to this regression.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I scrolled through with a determined feeling. Then, the sentences that were written in the section before the ending caught my attention.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Before the end of the scenario, Yoo Joonghyuk recalled countless memories of his death. 」</p></div>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 'In the third round, I almost died the first time I met Asmodeus'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I had too many thoughts.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…Eh? Wait. This was currently the third round…</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a knock on the door and I raised my head to see Mark. He saw that I was awake and waved. "R-Revolutionary! You woke up? That is fortunate."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What is going on?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Nothing. I just wanted to let you know that someone came to see you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was busy and wanted to tell him to come back later, when Mark continued speaking. "The owner of the industrial complex is looking for you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The owner of the industrial complex has come to visit you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">What did he mean? Wasn't I the owner of the industrial complex?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Get out of the way."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The next moment, someone pushed past Mark and entered the room. It was a presence that changed the atmosphere just by standing there.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I stared blankly at the man, my mouth gaping open. Yoo Joonghyuk, who I had thought to be dead, was standing in front of me.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">It took me a bit longer to come to my senses. Aileen, who had come back, glanced at us and disappeared after arranging the table while the blankly standing Mark also avoided this place. Once the surroundings became quiet, I opened my mouth first. "When did you come here?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Two days ago."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was ashamed of myself for freaking out in the last 10 minutes. The man I had been worried about was walking around the same industrial complex while I had all sorts of delusions about his death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…How did you survive? It was a situation where you couldn't survive."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I received a bit of help."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"From who? Was it your sponsor?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That guy has never helped me once."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I asked for his help but I didn't think he would actually help. From the beginning to the end of Ways of Survival, all he did was make Yoo Joonghyuk regress. Yoo Joonghyuk's wounds had healed and he looked quite healthy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A constellation helped me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"A constellation? Who?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You don't need to know the details."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What did you give in exchange? None of them would help for nothing."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I just received a slight penalty."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Penalty?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Until the Demon Realm scenario is over, I will disappear for 10 minutes a day."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Disappear? What does this mean?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Something like that. In any case, I have now entered the main scenario and the scenario error has been resolved. There is no need to worry about it."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk's expression while speaking seemed like he had solved something. It was somewhat troubling. I had fallen asleep for a week and Yoo Joonghyuk survived with the help of someone unrelated to me. Then he came here to finish becoming the ruler of the industrial complex.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Perhaps it was because it was rare to talk to Yoo Joonghyuk like this. An awkward silence filled the treatment room. Yoo Joonghyuk stared blankly down at the table while drinking tea.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to ask why he came here. I wanted to ask what he would do in the future. However, completely different words emerged from my mouth.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The others… are they doing well?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">In fact, Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't know. He was a person who only filled his head with the scenarios. Such a person wouldn't care about what other people were doing. I deliberately wanted to nag at him. Please don't live your life alone. If he lived like that, he could never reach the end of the scenario. I meant to give this speech. However…</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Lee Hyunsung went to the army." Yoo Joonghyuk started talking. "Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye are training new incarnations. They are strengthening their power in preparation for the future disaster scenarios."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Sangah and Han Sooyoung are in contact with government officials."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The two of them are together?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the first time I saw Yoo Joonghyuk saying so many words. Maybe this was why I fell into his story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Gong Pildu is buying land in Seongnam to build a huge castle. He seems to really think he is a king."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Haha, that ahjussi is really…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The two children are doing well. They seem to throw a coin every time they are bored."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I was fascinated as Yoo Joonghyuk continued to speak in a blunt voice. Some stories were easy to understand, while others took a bit more time. Nevertheless, they were all stories about someone I knew. The people I liked were living stories in a place where I didn't exist.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I listened, I felt somewhat sweet, sad, and nostalgic. "Everybody is busy living."</p>
<div class="orv_image"><img src="../../../assets/images/226 - As I listened, I felt somewhat sweet, sad and nostalgic.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></div>
<div class="orv_notice"><p>* Unofficial fan illustration (non-canonical)</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a strange loneliness at the end of the story. I see. Everyone was living well.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is shaking.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I realized that I was an 'outsider' of this story.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The 25th regression Yoo Joonghyuk said, 'I can't change anything'. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Without me, people were still continuing the scenarios. Just like Yoo Joonghyuk repeated the regressions. The 4th, 5th, 6th rounds… it led to an endless story where I could be easily forgotten. Meanwhile, people would move towards the ending. It was natural. It might be natural, but I felt pained at the reminder.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I bit my lips and tried to say something. I'm glad. The words didn't emerge from my mouth. Then I heard Yoo Joonghyuk's voice. "In addition, everyone is telling your story."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I slowly raised my head at the words. Yoo Joonghyuk's face was still expressionless. "They say it a lot. Your story."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I smiled slightly while covering my eyes with both hands. I didn't appear so on the surface, but I wanted to say that I was smiling. In the small darkness created by both hands, Yoo Joonghyuk's voice was heard again as he drank tea.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Let's go back to Earth, Kim Dokja."</p>
