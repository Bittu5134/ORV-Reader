        <article class="orv_main">
            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 14: Ep. 3 – Contract, III</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">Looking at the situation, I got a sense of what happened. "What is it? Is something wrong?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[This isn't possible. How can there be a firewall preventing the system interference…?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed Fourth Wall blocked not just the skills of an incarnation but the dokkaebi's interference as well. If this was true, it meant nobody in Ways of Survival could see my attributes window, including myself. How interesting. It was the perfect condition to become a scammer.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Forget about it."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[P-Please wait! I can do it. U-Uh. What if I do this?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"You can't do it."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Kuaaack!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung screamed like he had received an electric shock. The white fluffy hair on his skin was burned black.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[T-This! This!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"It's okay. If you can't do it then stop. I will ask for another favour."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[This can't be! I am Dokkaebi Bihyung. If I can't solve this situation, the honor of the dokkaebi―]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at the clock. It had been an hour since the ichthyosaur ate. There was no time to waste time like this.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"The Dokkaebi Bag."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung stopped his useless action of digging at the air.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Open the Dokkaebi Bag."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…How do you know about that?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you going to open it?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Only an incarnation with a sponsor can use the Dokkaebi Bag…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"It is true that all incarnations that use the Dokkaebi Bag have a sponsor, but there is no rule that an incarnation without a sponsor can't use the Dokkaebi Bag."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…Wait a minute.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung pulled out a manual and confirmed it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"At this point, I don't know if I am a dokkaebi or you are. Are you actually a dokkaebi?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The smiling Bihyung raised both hands.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…Okay, there is no problem if you use it. However, the Dokkaebi Bag can only be used when the channel is open for streaming purposes. Is that okay?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"It's fine."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[#BI-7623 channel is open.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellations have entered.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Then an electric current appeared in the air, and a transparent screen emerged in front of me.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Welcome to the coin shop, the 'Dokkaebi Bag'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Dokkaebi Bag…</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the moment when this damn world's 'cash store' was opened.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">There were two ways to use coins in Ways of Survival. One of them was to raise the level of the stats such as 'Physique' and 'Strength'. The other was to use it as a common form of currency that could be used in various stores, including the Dokkaebi Bag.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Buy it now! A starter pack for your incarnation for 2,500 coins!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A today only special! A 300% growth package, grow faster than others!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Did you accidentally pick an incarnation with a bad attribute? Don't worry! The 'Random Attribute Box' that can randomly change the attribute has been released!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There were numerous coin items, including various packages. All of the advertisements in the Dokkaebi Bag were aimed at the constellations raising incarnations. This was natural since the original customers of the Dokkaebi Bag were constellations. I got rid of the pop-up advertising windows one by one.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Although it was nothing compared to the 'disasters' that emerged in the fifth main scenario, a sea commander ichthyosaur was no different from a disaster for the early stage incarnations. To defeat the ichthyosaur, I needed some items sold in the Dokkaebi Bag.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Let's see…'</p>
<p class="orv_line">I looked at the catalog before glancing over at Bihyung. "Hey, are these the only items I can buy right now? Is there a search function?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[At that… Shit. Wait. Constellations. Please. Please calm down.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">From the moment the channel opened, Bihyung had been repeating explanations with comic-like sweat drops on his face.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[It was just a server error that shut the broadcast off for a while! I didn't turn it off on purpose.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">There were a total of 20 stars above Bihyung's head. Since not too many of them had left the channel, it seemed that quite a few constellations still wanted to see what had happened to me. Of course, not all of the constellations were friendly.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A few constellations are questioning the fairness of the broadcast!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A few constellations are suspicious of the privileges you have received!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't unexpected. While the broadcast was off, a hidden scenario had started, and the Dokkaebi Bag had been opened. It was no wonder that the constellations were surprised.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[No, preferences? Look at this, Constellations. I am a dokkaebi. Don't you know that I will be extinguished if I do that? Don't you know that the storyteller vow is never light?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Will you help me?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…There is a product search button in the lower right corner.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I ignored Bihyung and pressed the magnifying glass icon at the bottom of the package window.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The product search function is activated.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The product search function is limited to 5 times a day. Any additional searches will cost 100 coins per search.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In any case, it was the same for humans and dokkaebi. The total number of free searches given was five. Two searches were enough to buy the materials I needed, so I had three searches left.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is wondering about your plan.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'Yes, be curious. If you are curious, keep watching'.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is looking angrily at your actions.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">'Don't watch if you are going to get all twisted up'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened my mouth to use the search function, "Search for the 'Ancient Dragon' item."</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There are three search results.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">A small pop-up window soon emerged.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<h3 class="orv_window_title">[Search Results]</h3>
<p>Ancient Dragon's Heart – Stock: ?</p>
<p>Ancient Dragon's Bone – Stock: 1</p>
<p>Ancient Dragon's Horn – Stock: 1</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">I chose the Ancient Dragon's Heart.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<h3 class="orv_window_title">[Item Information]</h3>
<h3 class="orv_window_title">[Name: Ancient Dragon's Heart]</h3>
<p>Rating: SS</p>
<p>Description: A heart containing the magic power of the ancient dragon 'Ignitus'. It possesses near-infinite magic power, and the attribute 'Hellfire' will be acquired if a heart transplant is successful.</p>
<p>Price: 1,500,000 C</p>
<p>Stock: Just sold out.</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">As expected, it was out of stock. From beyond the catalog, Bihyung, who was dealing with the constellations, looked at me with his jaw dropped open.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Crazy. How do you know the information about the ancient dragon?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I just called out a nice name."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…It seems like a lie.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I shrugged. In the original Ways of Survival, the owner of the Ancient Dragon's Heart was already determined. If I remembered correctly, the owner of the heart was currently in Italy. They were a person with good luck, getting such a diamond of a sponsor. I called out several more product names.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<h3 class="orv_window_title">[Search Results]</h3>
<p>Great Demon's Eyes – Stock: 0</p>
<p>Purest Sword Force – Stock: 1</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">The Great Demon's Eyes were sold out… It seemed the hands of the constellations were really quick. Well, I couldn't buy the item anyway since the selling price was 1 million coins. At any rate, it was good to have a sponsor. Now the incarnation with the Great Demon's Eyes would grow and destroy the beginner scenarios.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What are you really? What type of cheat are you using? How do you know about items that can only be found in the search?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I just said plausible names."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Among the three items that I searched for, only the Purest Sword Force was in stock. Furthermore, the price was 10,000 coins, so I couldn't buy it now. I put it in the shopping cart for now.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What, are you buying it?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Not right now. I am just window shopping."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Sheesh, what a waste of time.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I am going to buy something else, so bring up the items I call out from now on."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I called out several item names. After a moment, a list of items emerged in front of me.</p>
<div class="orv_window">
<h3 class="orv_window_title">[Search Results]</h3>
<p>Mucus of the Hammer Seahorse – Stock: 124</p>
<p>Stone Hog's Pointed Thorn – Stock: 17</p>
</div>
<p class="orv_line">I compared it to the list in my memories. The hammer seahorse, which was the food of the ichthyosaur, and the stone hog, which was the nemesis of sea species… There was no doubt. This combination was the best when it came to attacking an ichthyosaur.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Four mucus, four thorns. It is 800 coins?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Yes, but… where are you going to use these miscellaneous items?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"You don't need to know."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…I don't want to be nosy but why don't you buy something else? For example, this Woryeong Sword Technique. It is originally 8,000 coins but I will now sell it for 4,000 coins. Wouldn't buying this be more helpful to clear the scenario?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Thank you but I will just buy this."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung wasn't satisfied but received the payment anyway.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[800 coins have been consumed.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the darkness, a sparkling powder gathered, and the four elongated thorns and four pockets of black mucus appeared.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I can't give a refund if you regret it now. Do you understand?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"I know." I nodded briefly and started working. I took off my shirt, tied it around my waist, and stuck the thorns in the gap between my shirt and my waist, while the pockets were hung from my waist. The stone hog's thorn was stumpy but became sharp at the end. It was approximately one meter in length. It was a reasonable size to pierce something.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Hrmm… Then I'll be going. I can't stay with you. There is something fun going on in another place.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Do it."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Huhu, then hang in there. I hope the story will bless you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Bihyung disappeared in a flash of light, and the surroundings became dark again. I could use the light from my smartphone, but I wanted to save the battery as much as possible. In the darkness, the stone hog thorn was emitting a bluish light. It was a feeble light, but it would be sufficient for the moment.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I pulled out a thorn and swung it. Maybe it was because I didn't have a skill such as Weapons Training or Incarnation of All Soldiers, but I couldn't get used to holding the thorn.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A few constellations are bored.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The impatient constellations left the channel. I couldn't see it, but Bihyung was probably fretting right now. Then an hour passed.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Right, left, up, and down. I didn't like it, but I no longer had a problem handling the thorn. The surface finish was rough and didn't seem like it would slip easily from my hand. It was time to begin. I used the proper force and stabbed at the ichthyosaur wall above me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tiing!</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was like poking a rubber elastic wall as the thorn bounced off. My current strength wasn't high enough to tear at the stomach of the ichthyosaur. It would probably be the same if I used a skill. At that moment, the small holes at the top of the stomach wall opened simultaneously. Then an absolutely disgusting liquid poured out.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kuweek!" One of the demonic people floating on something in the stomach started shrieking. The demonic person's skin started burning. The digestion of the ichthyosaur had begun. The ichthyosaur's digestive juices quickly mixed into the river water and started to melt away the concrete and other floating products.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was no time. However, it was going as planned. I jumped from the floating object and gripped a bump on the wall of the stomach. Then I started climbing up the wall like I was rock climbing.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gurgle gurgle gurgle.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The outlet of the digestive juices was right above. I put the thorn in my mouth and grabbed a pocket of the hammer seahorse's mucus. Pouring the mysterious dark blue liquid onto my hand, I then applied the mucus carefully onto the thorn, from the tip down to the end. I did it with precision and care, like applying shaving cream to an area to be shaved. If the shaving cream protected the skin from the razor, then the mucus protected the thorn from the digestive juices.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Go'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I swung the thorn toward where the digestive juices were coming from. The angle was correct, and I used my maximum strength. The digestive juices flowed down the thorn and dissolved the skin on my forearm. I experienced a terrible pain but didn't stop. If I made a mistake here, everything would be over.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' has relieved some of the pain.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Gurgle, gurgle. Chururuk…</p>
<p class="orv_line">Before long, the thorn jammed up the emission point.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Just one."</p>
<p class="orv_line">After a deep sigh, I pulled out another thorn from my waist. I applied the mucus of the hammer seahorse onto another thorn, found another opening, and blocked it.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A few constellations admire your calmness.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Constellations have sponsored you 200 coins.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I used this method to block three opening points. There were some left, but the small openings didn't release large amounts of digestive fluids. There was one thorn left in the top tightly tied around me. All that was left was one thorn and two pockets of mucus.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I used the remaining mucus on my skin and clothes, and then poured the remainder down my throat.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Kup."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The fishy taste on my tongue was sickening but it was better than dying. The bitterness was nothing compared to the disaster that would occur starting from this moment. It was around five minutes afterward that the entire stomach started trembling.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…It had started.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kieeeeeeek-!</p>
<p class="orv_line">The ichthyosaur let out a painful scream. The blood vessels on the wall of the stomach were squirming, and the thorns were visibly expanding into the blood vessels. The thorns in the openings had started their aggressive growth activity. This was because the stone hog's thorns grew in response to the body fluids of seawater species.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The thorns, which had become immune to the digestive juices due to the applied mucus, absorbed the surrounding fluids and started to take root in the body of the ichthyosaur. The stone hog's thorns wouldn't stop expanding until the ichthyosaur was completely dead.</p>
<p class="orv_line">As I watched the liquid swirl under my feet, I grabbed a thorn tightly. I had done everything I could. From now on, it was a mental fight. Either I would die or this guy would die. Only one of us would survive.</p>
