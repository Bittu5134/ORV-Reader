            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 157: Ep. 31 - Tomb of the Scenario, I</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">The white storm energy caused my heart to pound and my body changed into an engine.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The exclusive skill 'Electrification' Lv. 11 (+1) has been activated.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Due to the increase in my status, the skill level reached 11.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In essence, all skill levels were restricted to level 10. After that, people had to learn better skills or use 'transcendence' like the returnees. Yet this skill was level 11.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Now my Electrification had exceeded the limits of the system. It wasn't as hard to use Electrification as usual.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The returnee Kyrgios had a strength comparable to a powerful narrative-grade constellation. He was a strong figure whose depth couldn't be measured. Now I could get a glimpse of how much strength Kyrgios had. If Kyrgios had reached a realm that could never be reached, I got a glimpse of where he had gone.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tentacio was terrified beyond his surprise. "A constellation with a returnee's ability? What on earth are you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to say my name but then my grumpiness got to me. "…What? I am Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Tentacio's body was torn in two by the explosive power of Electrification and the Blade of Faith.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The electric current around the sword blew off his arms and legs before his head rolled across the ground. He couldn't even scream. My level 90 magic power was instantly exhausted and fatigue pulled in. Still, I have clearly won.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uh… Yoo Joonghyuk…" Shit, I was scared to death. The fallen head was talking. "Incarnation… do you know… what it means… to be a constellation?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">What the hell was he saying now?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You will regret… giving me… your name."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What?"</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Demon Earl Tentacio has used 'Death Scream.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Demon Earl Tentacio has spread the name 'Yoo Joonghyuk' through Dark Castle.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Dark Castle rankers will remember the name 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…I hadn't expected this.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Dark Castle rankers are baring their teeth towards the incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I felt a bit sorry. I really hadn't intended for this to happen. However, Yoo Joonghyuk should also suffer a bit.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have hunted 'Demon Earl Tentacio'!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[A 3rd grade demon has been killed for the fifth time and 30,000 coins have been acquired.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Transparent strings started to appear around Tentacio's corpse. From the Dark Castle scenario onwards, we could kill those who had stories and take them away. I stretched out my hand and grabbed the string.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The historical-grade story 'Bug Slaughter' has been acquired.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Bug Slaughter.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This story would be enough to hatch the 41st regression Shin Yoosung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…By the way, could I feed her the story of a demon? Would her mentality get worse if I fed it to her?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have completed the bounty scenario!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' feels deep appreciation towards you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You are now able to receive the protection of the Silla constellations.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The protection of the Silla constellations. They might seem insignificant but they were also 'constellations'. If I built up a relationship with them, there would surely be a day when they could help me, just like the Absolute Throne situation.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The historical-grade story 'Silla Allied Forces' has been received.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…Silla Allied Forces?</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' is laughing heartily.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Well, she said she would give me a historical-grade story, not that it would be a good one. It didn't matter since I could feed it to Shin Yoosung.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My party members recovered their spirits and approached me.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Shit, Kim Dokja is crazy…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Dokja-ssi, how strong are you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I grinned at them. Lee Hyunsung looked down at his shoulders that had been bitten by Tentacio. "…Are there many enemies like him on the second floor?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There are some but it is uncommon. This guy's ranking is probably…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">A message finally popped up in the air.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[50,000 coins have been acquired as a main scenario reward!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The main scenario content has been updated!]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have won a place in Dark Castle.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[You have hunted the 10th place demon on the Dark Castle Rankings, Tentacio.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Ranking will be in proportion to the hunting contribution.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"…10th place. There are at least nine existences stronger than this guy. There are more similar guys."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Ah…" Lee Hyunsung's expression was complicated. He was relieved that the demon earl was in the top 10 but at the same time, he was discouraged. "Dokja-ssi is strong enough to fight these guys."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hyunsung-ssi can do it if you follow your story. I also can't guarantee that I can hunt demons higher ranked than him."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In my current state, I could deal with an earl-grade demon without opening a story. It wouldn't have been as easy if Bug Slaughter wasn't his story.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung's pride also seemed hurt. "Sheesh, pretending to be modest. Aren't you deceiving people?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You might've done it if you had fought with all your power. Didn't the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon hand you a story?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I haven't succeeded them yet because the contents of the story are crazy. Why didn't you warn me when I said I would choose him? Were you fucking with me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">'The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon's story was…'</p>
<p class="orv_line">I couldn't remember well but considering the fact that the original contractor was Delusional Demon Kim Namwoon, Han Sooyoung's reaction was understandable. It would be a shameful story that would annihilate the soul just by inheriting it.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Dark Castle Rankings in proportion to the hunting contribution will be announced!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Finally, the rankings were determined. A ranking number was sent to the status window in front of all of us.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The incarnation Kim Dokja's ranking in Dark Castle is 11th place.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">11th place. It wasn't bad. The rest of my party members had terrible expressions, as if they were receiving their CSAT scores.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung quickly ran to my side and glanced at my ranking window.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Hey, you are quite high…" Han Sooyoung's expression hardened when she saw the number '11'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There was a big difference in contribution. Han Sooyoung and the others were probably in the hundreds. She wondered, "Will I be 11th place if I kill you now?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Do you think you can win?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I don't know. In any case, I am better than that ahjussi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Han Sooyoung pointed out the passed out Kim Yongpal.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The incarnation Kim Yongpal's ranking in Dark Castle is number 101,123.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The 102,123th ranked Kim Yongpal slept without a care in the world.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Jihye and Lee Gilyoung, who had been unconscious since the beginning, received the ranks of 98,761 and 87,541 respectively. This was strange. Why was this ahjussi's rank lower than people who had been unconscious from the beginning.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What about Lee Hyunsung-ssi?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"636th place."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Lee Hyunsung's voice was gloomy. I hesitated to speak words of comfort but Lee Hyunsung opened his mouth first. "…It's fine. I received many reports like this during my school days. I'm somehow more motivated."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It seemed there was no need for me to worry. Lee Hyunsung was the type to become more devoted if he had a specific goal.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosung, who was standing beside me, shook when my eyes met hers. "D-Don't look!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">She was like an elementary school student hiding a report card from her parents. I was a bit worried about this child.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It doesn't matter what ranking you are right now. There will be many chances to rise up after going to the second floor. It depends on how hard Yoosung works."</p>
<p class="orv_line">…Damn, I shouldn't say such lame things. Not everything would work out if you tried hard.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Still, Shin Yoosung seemed to sincerely accept my advice. "…Can I become strong enough ahjussi?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Of course. You're stronger than me."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I spoke sincerely. In fact, Shin Yoosung had more potential than anyone else here.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Your stigma is about to blossom.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Screening the story of your stigma.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Shin Yoosung would grow explosively once she received a stigma. No, even without a stigma, Shin Yoosung was essential for the second floor of Dark Castle. It was a stage where the children could be active.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"However, I don't know why this ranking was suddenly given. If it merely for a competition… perhaps the person who reaches the top will receive a medal."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Lee Hyunsung who spoke. His words weren't wrong. I'm sure this was the purpose. There was an even more fundamental reason for the Dark Castle Rankings.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I opened my mouth.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The demon king 'Asmodeus' is interested in your presence.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The demon king 'Astaroth' is watching you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The demon king 'Orobas' is hungry for your story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It wasn't just me. The other party members also received the message. The messages were much more disturbing than those sent by the constellations. The messages alone caused everyone to shake.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In particular, Han Sooyoung was completely frightened since she previously received the curse of the demon king.</p>
<p class="orv_line">A demon king. Among them, a few had a 'status' that could compare to the constellation. At the end of this scenario, we would fight a demon king.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">"Kuaaaack!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">The blade curved in a beautiful manner and cut off the head of a demon species.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'…He was one without a story'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk had climbed up to the second floor and launched his full-scale plan to raise his ranking. As always, plans for the future were crammed in his head like training routines.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'In order to get to the third floor, I need to seek the four heavenly kings'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'The top rankers should be in the same section'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'One of the 10 Evils is on the second floor. It is better not to bump into him'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'If I keep collecting stories like this, perhaps in four days…'</p>
<p class="orv_line">Then a message appeared in the air.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[Someone has spread your name with 'Death Scream'.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Dark Castle rankers will remember your name.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Dark Castle rankers are watching for you.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The Dark Castle rankers will aim for your story.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk frowned at the message.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'My name was suddenly spoken?'</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was strange.</p>
<p class="orv_line">'Death Scream is a demon curse. I haven't killed one yet who used that ability'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Mia's cheeks puffed up from beside him and she asked, "What is it Oppa?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's nothing." Yoo Joonghyuk hesitated for a moment before adding, "…It seems that guy is doing something bothersome again."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"That guy?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"There is such a person."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Mia watched her brother, who had spoken in a cold voice. There was a nuance different from usual in his voice. It was a small change, like a grain of rice, but Yoo Mia was able to perceive the change. It was because Yoo Joonghyuk was her oppa.</p>
<div class="orv_image"><img src="../../../assets/images/157 - Yoo Mia watched her brother, who had spoken in a cold voice.jpg" alt="158 - 1711" loading="lazy"></div>
<div class="orv_notice"><p>* Unofficial fan illustration (non-canonical)</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you referring to that ugly ahjussi?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Oppa looks happy when talking about that ahjussi."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk was embarrassed when he saw his smiling sister and he replied sharply. "You are mistaken."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Mia laughed at Yoo Joonghyuk. Yoo Joonghyuk scowled and wanted to say something to her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The next moment, a bloody aura rose from Yoo Joonghyuk's body. Yoo Mia thought he was really angry but Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth first. "Stop eavesdropping and come out. Otherwise I will kill you."</p>
<p class="orv_line">One part of the air seemed rigid and a heavenly doll appeared from a crack in the air. It was a woman wearing a cloak.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"I'm sorry. It wasn't on purpose."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Who are you?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"It's me, Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The cloak was removed, revealing a surprising figure. Yoo Joonghyuk knew this face. Not long ago, he had rescued her.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…Yoo Sangah?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was Yoo Sangah, who was the incarnation of the nebula Olympus.</p>
