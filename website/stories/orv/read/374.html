            <div class="orv_title"><h1>Ch 288: Ep. 54 - Demon King Slayer, IV</h1></div>
<p class="orv_line">A day passed since I arrived in the 1863rd round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The Gwanghwamun area was wet from the dark rain that had been falling since last night. Soon after the rain started, the monsters crouching between the ruins woke up one by one. There was the monster that looked like an elephant that I saw when I first got here and one that reminded me of a huge octopus. The most frightening thing was the baby that was the size of a huge building.</p>
<p class="orv_line">There were many types of outer gods but not all of them were named 'Devourer of Dreams' or 'Indescribable Distance'. Most of them were 'unnamed' and existed without a proper ego.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I watched the baby in a diaper pushing through the city like a bulldozer and hid while holding my breath.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…To be honest, I probably needed the diaper more than the baby.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It had been a few hours since the archangels fell asleep, stating that they would save their energy.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The white lily in my coat trembled as if it had regained power. Gabriel.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Have you woken up?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Why did you make that choice?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"What choice?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Do you need to ask?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"There was no other way."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I heard a creaking and crushing sound in the distance. The moment I thought something else had happened, I saw the torn off leg of the elephant monster. There were signs that it was torn off by a powerful force. Someone dragged the severed leg and approached this way. It was the real monster of this scenario, Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Like a sigh, the petals shook again. [I thought he would die… why is he holding a sword?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">"He could've committed suicide. Well, I don't think that will happen now."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I spoke while swinging Yoo Joonghyuk's Splitting the Sky Sword through the air. It wasn't surprising but I didn't kill Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gabriel was silent for a moment before muttering in a small voice. [What does Uriel like about this guy…?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Uriel? Ah, is Uriel well?"</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[How should I know?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">It was a reaction that seemed a bit excessive. The moment I was about to ask, another indirect message came.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is looking at you.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The difficult angel had also woken up. Jophiel woke up and got straight to the point. [Did you decide to keep him alive?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I accepted the elephant's leg that Yoo Joonghyuk had brought instead of answering. It was a leg that was very fleshy. It gave off a very rich and clear story. I faced Yoo Joonghyuk who stared at me with empty eyes. Jophiel opened her mouth again.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Don't you know that you shouldn't keep him alive? The scenario you received is…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Yoo Joonghyuk's death."</p>
<p class="orv_line">It would've been nice if I could lie but it was too late to deceive the archangels. They would've seen the scenario window that I saw.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Yoo Joonghyuk's death.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was the scenario that Secretive Plotter gave me. I had to kill him in order to return to the original third round.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"As I've already mentioned, it is difficult to interpret this scenario as it is." The death proposed by Secretive Plotter might not be the 'death' we thought about.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The archangels were silent. They didn't seem to understand my words. I flipped the elephant's leg and calmly declared. "Yoo Joonghyuk can't 'die'. As archangels, you should already know this?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I could feel the gazes of the two angels on me.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What does that mean?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"This guy is a regressor."</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the early scenarios, the information I just mentioned would've been filtered but now it was different. The scenario was a scenario but by now, rumours about the 'regressor' should've spread quite a bit. Thus, the high-ranking constellations of Eden would know it.</p>
<p class="orv_line">The red cosmos leaves shook uneasily. […Don't tell me?]</p>
<p class="orv_line">I nodded. "He is a being who repeats his life forever. No one can kill him. If he dies, he will just move onto another round."</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[How do you know this?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">"Why was Uriel keeping an eye on me?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was best to respond to questions that couldn't be answered was with more questions. Jophiel trembled as if controlling his anger.</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Then… what are you going to do now? If you can't kill him, you can't return to your original round.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I shrugged and placed the roasted meat into my mouth. "I have to think about a way. There is plenty of time."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At my calm response, an unusual air flowed around the two flowers. I was nervous because I thought they wanted to express their 'status', only to suddenly hear a strange sound.</p>
<p class="orv_line">It was a growl that wasn't coming from my stomach. It didn't seem to be Yoo Joonghyuk either.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…Then? I bowed my head and saw the two flowers looking away.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Are you hungry?"</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Gabriel, how long are you going to stand by?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[I'm not standing by. I'm just watching. If it wasn't for Uriel, I would've killed him…]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Gabriel, who was stuck in a plastic bottle, answered while sucking up water through his stem. Beside her, the cosmos of Jophiel was likewise inserted into a bottle of water.</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, Kim Dokja was saying something to Yoo Joonghyuk. Gabriel stared at him blankly and asked,</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[That Uriel, is she well?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Focus on the mission, Gabriel.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[No, I'm worried. Uriel always gets into trouble when she is left alone.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[…I see. Do you actually like Uriel?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What nonsense! Have you found a way to go back yet? How long are we supposed to stay with them?]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Gabriel's petals fluttered and Jophiel replied, [I'm looking for a way but it seems hard.]</p>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[Why? No matter how different the world line, there must be Eden here. If you ask the scribe here for help…]</p></div>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[There is no reply from the scribe.]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[What?]</p></div>
<div class="orv_constellation"><p>[It isn't just the scribe. I can't contact anyone from Eden.]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">Eden couldn't be contacted? It was strange, no matter how much the world had changed. Due to the constraints of the scenario, it was impossible to return to their original 'constellation context'. It was frustrating.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Gabriel sighed and sucked up water again. [What? They were fighting and holding each other by the collar a few hours ago…]</p>
<p class="orv_line">In the distant place, Kim Dokja seemed to be stroking Yoo Joonghyuk's head. Looking at this scene, Gabriel was reminded of Uriel and herself. It was different but there was some resemblance.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…Companionship?</p>
<p class="orv_line">For a very short time, Gabriel seemed to understand why Uriel liked them.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="orv_line">"Eat the soil, Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk started to silently eat the soil. I was startled and smacked him in the back of the head. "Why are you really eating it?!"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I wanted to test it but I didn't know he would actually follow my order. The Yoo Joonghyuk I knew would've never done this. However, the regression depression had completely devoured his ego and for the time being, Yoo Joonghyuk was in a stupid state. Yoo Joonghyuk looked up at me blankly.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sighed with some compassion. "How good would it be if the usual you was so calm? You are better than the third round bastard."</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…"</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…Spit it out."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I watched Yoo Joonghyuk spitting out the soil and remembered another Yoo Joonghyuk that I knew. I didn't know if he was okay. It would be nice if he hadn't lost his mind by the time I came back. I entrusted it to Yoo Sangah so I hoped things would turn out well.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Now lie down there and get some rest, 1863rd Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p class="orv_line">At my words, Yoo Joonghyuk trudged towards the ruined building. I could see the sun setting in the distance. The sunset of the 95th scenario was still glowing. I looked at the haze and felt strangely peaceful. It was strange. In this horrible scenario, I could indulge in this appreciation.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Kim Dok ja needs to kill Yoo Joong hyuk. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">…No, I didn't. Fortunately, there was no deadline for the scenario that Secretive Plotter gave me. I turned my head and saw Yoo Joonghyuk curled up with a foolish expression as he waited for my orders.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Sleep."</p>
<p class="orv_line">Yoo Joonghyuk understood my words and closed his eyes. Since the scenario started, Yoo Joonghyuk had never slept properly. Maybe this was the 'first sleep' for Yoo Joonghyuk. It was the first sleep where he was freed from all his memories.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Once Yoo Joonghyuk was completely asleep, I turned on my smartphone. The phone desktop contained the text of Ways of Survival as usual. However, there was something different this time.</p>
<p class="orv_line">–Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World.txt</p>
<p class="orv_line">…What? Wasn't it the 'third revision?' I suddenly got goosebumps. Was it because I came back to the original round? Then it changed back to the original text, not the revised one?</p>
<p class="orv_line">I opened the file with a confused mind. The file was the original Ways of Survival that I knew. Maybe this was better. It was important to obtain information about this round if I wanted to think properly about the future. I quickly moved the screen to the 1863rd round and read all the information thoroughly.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 I lost Lee Hyunsung in the 54th scenario. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I read the story, read it and read it again.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 In the 67th scenario, Lee Seolhwa was killed. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">He lost, lost and lost more people.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Lee Jihye died in the 78th scenario. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">The Yoo Joonghyuk of this round was completely alone. In fact, it wasn't only this round. In all of Yoo Joonghyuk's rounds, he had to leave alone. It was the same life even until the end.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"…Poor guy."</p>
<p class="orv_line">I didn't know the epilogue of Ways of Survival. The one thing I could be sure of was that Ways of Survival didn't have a happy ending.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…What if I didn't go back to the third round? What if I stayed here and helped Yoo Joonghyuk of the last round clear the scenario?</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 The Fourth Wall says, "Kim Dok ja, that…" 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">I know.</p>
<div class="orv_quote"><p>「 Ye s. 」</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">This was the trick hidden in Secretive Plotter's scheme. Perhaps Secretive Plotter expected this and gave me a scenario. It was why the scenario had no time limit.</p>
<p class="orv_line">Kill Yoo Joonghyuk here and return to the original world. Or see the conclusion of the scenario with Yoo Joonghyuk here.</p>
<p class="orv_line">This was the idea of the 'outer god'. The laughable thing was that I was really shaken by the proposal. If I looked at the person here… I wouldn't see the ending I really wanted. But if I killed him here, the original 'Yoo Joonghyuk' would disappear forever.</p>
<p class="orv_line">My head hurt as I thought about it. If I wanted to kill Yoo Joonghyuk, I had to end Yoo Joonghyuk's regressions. However, his sponsor didn't speak and I didn't know the identity. I didn't know if it was fortunate or not.</p>
<p class="orv_line">I sighed and scrolled through Ways of Survival again. Then I felt a cold feeling down my spine.</p>
<div class="orv_system"><p>[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' is warning you!]</p></div>
<p class="orv_line">In the distance, the two flowers in the plastic bottles were shaking. It was a strong alarm. Was it an outer god?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"You've been hiding here, Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The moment I reflexively tried to turn around, I felt an eerie prediction. If I turned around now, I would die. I clearly had this feeling. It was a degree of stealth that could fool my constellation senses. It was clearly an unquantifiable existence. The presence was nearby?</p>
<p class="orv_line">"What are you? Are you Yoo Joonghyuk's companion?"</p>
<p class="orv_line">I got a sense of deja vu from the voice. It was clearly a voice I knew. I turned my head slowly enough so that the enemy wouldn't feel threatened. Behind me was a woman with a familiar appearance. For a moment, my mind was awash with panic.</p>
<p class="orv_line">…How on earth? I hadn't thought about it. It was because this person was already dead in this 'round'.</p>
<p class="orv_line">"Well, there is no need to know. I'll kill him anyway."</p>
<p class="orv_line">The smiling Admiral Lee Jihye smiled as she pointed the Double Dragon Swords towards me.</p>
