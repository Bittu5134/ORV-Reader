3. **Sign In/Up:** Log in to your existing GitHub account or create a new one.

4. **File View:** You'll see the content of the text file.

5. **Edit This File:** Look for and click the button that allows you to edit the file (it might be a pencil icon or text like "Edit this file").

6. **Forking (If Necessary):** GitHub might create a copy ("fork") of the project in your account if you don't have write access.

7. **Make Edits:** Use the online text editor to modify the file content.

8. **Propose Changes:** Scroll down and describe your changes in the provided fields (title and optional description).

9. **Click "Propose changes":** Submit your edits.

10. **Create Pull Request:** After clicking "Propose Changes", a new page will open. Click the **Create pull request** button (green). On the next page, click **Create pull request** again. Congratulations! You've contributed to this site and improved it for everyone.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you are not creating a new branch every time you make an edit. When prompted, choose the `commit to main branch` option and periodically keep syncing your repository to keep it up to date.

## What You Can Edit

You can contribute by editing the chapter text files located in the `/chapters` directory. Here's what you can help with:

- **Fix Typos:** Correct spelling and grammatical errors.
- **Correct Formatting:** Fix system message types, constellation speech, or outer god dialogues.
- **Improve Content:** Add missing tags or improve the overall formatting.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always refer to the [Formatting Guide](./formatting.md) for detailed instructions on using tags and formatting styles.

## Adding Images

You can contribute by adding illustrations and cover images to the chapters.

### Steps to Add Images

1. **Upload the Image:** Upload the image to the `website/assets/images` folder with a unique name (e.g., `CH512-01.jpg`).

2. **Edit the Chapter File:** Edit the corresponding chapter file in the `/chapters` directory to include the image using the `<img>` tag.

3. **Use Proper Syntax:** Refer to the [Formatting Guide](./formatting.md) for the correct syntax.

### Example

```
<img>[CH512-01.jpg][Illustration for Chapter 512]
```

## Improving the Front End

If you're up for a challenge, you can contribute to improving the front end of the website.

### Front-End File Locations

- All front-end files are located in the `/website` directory.
- Static pages and assets can be edited directly.

### Editing Chapter Pages

> [!WARNING]
> **Chapter HTML files (e.g., `ch_1.html`, `ch_2.html`) are automatically generated by GitHub Actions and should NOT be edited directly!**

To modify the chapter pages:

1. **Edit Template Files:** Modify the corresponding `template.html` files:
   - `website/stories/orv/read/template.html` (Main story)
   - `website/stories/cont/read/template.html` (Continuation)
   - `website/stories/side/read/template.html` (Side stories)

2. **Preserve Data Tags:** Do not copy-paste content between template files. Each template contains unique data tags that must remain intact.

3. **Test Locally:** Always test your changes locally before submitting a pull request.

## Important Notes

- **Follow the Formatting Guide:** Always follow the [Formatting Guide](./formatting.md) to ensure consistency.
- **Avoid Auto-Generated Files:** Do not edit chapter HTML files in the `/website/stories/*/read/` directories (e.g., `ch_1.html`, `ch_2.html`). These are automatically generated by GitHub Actions.
- **Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about anything, feel free to open an issue on GitHub for clarification.
- **Be Patient:** Be respectful and patient during the review process.
