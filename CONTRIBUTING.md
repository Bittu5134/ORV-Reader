### What You Can Edit

## Adding Images

You can contribute by adding illustrations and cover images to the chapters.

### Steps to Add Images
1. Upload the image to the `website/assets/images` folder with a unique name (e.g., `CH512-01.jpg`).
2. Edit the corresponding chapter file to include the image using the `<img>` tag. Refer to the [Formatting Guide](./formatting.md) for the correct syntax.

Example:
```
<img>[CH512-01.jpg][Illustration for Chapter 512]
```

## Improving the Front End

If you're up for a challenge, you can contribute to improving the front end of the website.

### Front-End Files
- All front-end files are located in the `/website` directory.
- The files for individual chapters are dynamically generated using GitHub Actions. To edit these, modify the corresponding `template.html` files:
  - `website/stories/orv/read/template.html`
  - `website/stories/cont/read/template.html`
  - `website/stories/side/read/template.html`

### Important Notes
- Do not copy-paste content between template files. Each template contains unique data tags that must remain intact.
- Test your changes locally before submitting a pull request.

## Important Notes

- Always follow the [Formatting Guide](./formatting.md) to ensure consistency.
- Avoid making unnecessary changes to dynamically generated files.
- If you're unsure about anything, feel free to open an issue on GitHub for clarification.
- Be respectful and patient during the review process.

Thank you for contributing to the ORV-Reader project!
