<hr/>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Everyone, thank you for waiting for so long.</p>
<p>Finally, we begin the side story of Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint.</p>
<p>I've started it, but honestly, I have no idea what to write. This story was never written with a spin-off in mind in the first place.</p>
<p>While I was taking a break, I read the comments fans left on the main story, and I was truly surprised.</p>
<p>You guys are geniuses. On the other hand, I can't seem to come up with a single thing. How thoughtless of me… In fact, I haven’t even decided on a main character yet.</p>
<p>When I was writing ORV, the words flowed smoothly, but now my mind is a complete blank—as if someone had struck me hard on the back of the head.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the reason I am writing this notice is because I feel I should at least say something.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>After writing that much, I stopped typing and held down the backspace key.</p>
<p>Damn it, what am I doing? No matter how desperate the situation, this isn't how a professional writer should speak.</p>
<p>I bit my nails and tried to craft a new sentence.</p>
<p>How about starting like this?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I've never formally introduced myself. My identity was technically revealed in chapter 549 of 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』, but I'm sure you've all forgotten by now.</p>
<p>To put it in Kim Dokja's terms, I am this kind of person:</p>
<p>Lee Hakhyun (李鶴翾).</p>
<p>My father, wishing for me to fly like a noble crane, paid a hefty sum of 300,000 won to a Philosophy Hall to give me that name.</p>
<p>The crane’s wings are spread wide¹. (학 학(鶴)에 날 현(翾).)</p>
<a href="#note1" epub:type="noteref">[NOTE 1]</a><p>The Philosophy Hall² that named me went bankrupt shortly after. It was only then that my father discovered the parentheses hidden in front of the character “翾,” which means “to fly (lightly).”</p>
<a href="#note2" epub:type="noteref">[NOTE 2]</a><p>In short, my life was defined by this: Lee Hakhyun, 33 years old, a (lightly) successful web novel author.</p>
<p>By the way, the name of my only hit is:</p>
<fieldset>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">[Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint - Total 551 Chapters]</h3>
<p>―Author Lee Hakhyun</p>
</fieldset>
<p>A long-form fantasy novel consisting of 551 chapters, 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』—abbreviated as “ORV.”</p>
<p>I spent two years of my life on this story, from my late 20s into my early 30s…</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>After writing that much, I hit backspace again.</p>
<p>I just introduced myself, and it felt even worse. What’s the point of introducing myself when I'm not even the protagonist of this side story?</p>
<p>Tsutsutsu.</p>
<p>That wasn't the sound of a probability spark. It was my cell phone vibrating.</p>
<p>I pressed the call button with a grim expression, feeling like Kim Dokja preparing for a massive storm of probability aftermath. Then, I heard the voice of the dokkaebi in charge.</p>
<p>―Author-nim.</p>
<p>This was currently my second most feared word.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>―Are you working on the side story?</p>
<p>And that was the first.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>The person sighing on the other end of the line was Ji Eunyu, my dedicated editor.</p>
<p>To be blunt, Ji Eunyu is a veteran producer in this industry. If I’m being honest, she’s the one who dragged me—a man who used to write pure literature—into this world. In that sense, she was a lifesaver.</p>
<p>―What do you plan to do?</p>
<p>I answered in a hollow voice.</p>
<p>“That’s the question. What should I do?”</p>
<p>―You’re not playing a game right now, are you? That new one that just launched?</p>
<p>“I only just installed it.”</p>
<p>―Then why are you showing as 'online' on Steam?</p>
<p>“It... launches automatically when I boot up the computer.”</p>
<p>―Really? Because I just got a notification that you started a session.</p>
<p>I quickly shut down the game as it was loading.</p>
<p>“Do you think I’m playing just for fun? I’m playing to gather ideas.”</p>
<p>―I used to believe that. I really did.</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu has a theory she’s developed over six years as an editor:</p>
<p>Writers who play games for 'inspiration' will keep playing long after the inspiration arrives.</p>
<p>Honestly, I couldn't argue with that.</p>
<p>―What about that idea you mentioned before?</p>
<p>“When I actually sat down to write it, it fell apart.”</p>
<p>―You said you wanted to connect it with your previous works. We discussed it briefly, remember?</p>
<p>I recalled the titles of my past failures one by one.</p>
<p>『The Orc Philosopher』</p>
<p>『Infinite Instructor』</p>
<p>『System Breaker』</p>
<p>『The Wizard of the Undying World』</p>
<p>『Method Master』</p>
<p>『How to Become a Star Writer』</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>No matter how I looked at it, there was no natural way to blend those stories with ORV.</p>
<p>Besides, 『How to Become a Star Writer』 was an absurd tale about a writer named Lee Hakhyun (yes, me) getting trapped inside a novel to become a “star writer.” There was no way I could use that for a collaboration.</p>
<p>And above all—</p>
<p>“Why would I collaborate with a failure?”</p>
<p>Most of those novels were axed before they even reached a paid model.</p>
<p>―I enjoyed them all, though.</p>
<p>“Hearing that doesn't comfort me at all.”</p>
<p>―You mentioned getting drunk on the rooftop once and having an epiphany. Can’t you try that again?</p>
<p>“I already tried.”</p>
<p>―Well... do you feel any tingling in the back of your head? Does Han Sooyoung appear in your dreams?</p>
<p>I sighed, caught between a laugh and a sob.</p>
<p>In the novel, Yoo Joonghyuk would hit me in the back of the head, Han Sooyoung would send me the manuscript, and I would write it all perfectly... but reality isn't like that. These days, I almost wish it were true.</p>
<p>―Ugh, I’m sorry.</p>
<p>I knew why she said it. Ji Eunyu was just as frustrated as I was.</p>
<p>The news is full of reports about the market downturn. I heard Ji Eunyu's management firm is also struggling financially. Employees are leaving, and their contracted writers are jumping ship or quitting the industry entirely.</p>
<p>I wondered if me writing a side story would even make a difference in a mess like this.</p>
<p>―Anyway, there are still many readers waiting for your story, Author-nim.</p>
<p>“Where are they?”</p>
<p>It’s embarrassing to admit, but “ORV” once held the number one spot on the platform’s free bestseller list. It had its glory days.</p>
<p>There were readers who genuinely liked my work, and discussions used to pop up in various communities.</p>
<p>Back when I was still serializing, I would secretly search for “Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint” and smile at the readers’ reactions.</p>
<p>But that’s all in the past now.</p>
<p>No one remembers my novel anymore.</p>
<p>―Stop being so cynical. They exist.</p>
<p>Then where?</p>
<p>I swallowed the question before it could escape.</p>
<p>“I’ll try my best.”</p>
<p>After hanging up, I decided I needed a drink.</p>
<p>I closed my laptop and headed to a nearby convenience store for a beer and some snacks. I reached for the potato chips, but hesitated, eventually swapping them for a protein biscuit.</p>
<p>Am I at the age where I have to worry about my health now?</p>
<p>As I sipped the beer, Ji Eunyu’s words echoed in my mind.</p>
<p>「“There are many readers waiting for Author-nim’s story.”」</p>
<p>For the record, the single brackets (「」) are symbols I use when I’m having a significant thought. And I’m having one right now.</p>
<p>Are there really readers still waiting for me?</p>
<p>I finished the beer and logged into the web novel platform.</p>
<p>A mountain of notifications awaited me. System messages urging me to resume serialization, and notes from other writers announcing their new projects.</p>
<p>And then…</p>
<p>―I enjoyed reading this, Author-nim.</p>
<p>Messages from readers.</p>
<p>―I’m a 14-year-old in middle school this year. This was the first web novel I ever read ㅜㅜ…</p>
<p>Some were cute, others were deeply sincere.</p>
<p>―Reading this novel is the only joy of my life in the military…</p>
<p>They were fragments of stories left for me by those who had read my work.</p>
<p>Three years have passed since then.</p>
<p>The middle schoolers must be in high school now. The high schoolers are in college, the soldiers have been discharged, and the job seekers have hopefully found their way… I hope.</p>
<p>Either way, those readers moved on to become 'something' else, while I’m still here—a boring man choosing protein biscuits over chips.</p>
<p>―It was fun, Author-nim.</p>
<p>I felt a sudden pang in my chest and spilled a bit of beer.</p>
<p>A new notification light was blinking. It was a message that had just arrived.</p>
<p>Who would send a message to an author three years after a story ended?</p>
<p>―Sender: RepresentativeKimDokja.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw the ID, a memory surfaced.</p>
<p>RepresentativeKimDokja.</p>
<p>During the height of the serialization, there was a reader with that exact nickname.</p>
<p>―It’s been three years since ORV ended. Every year around this time, I come back to binge-read it, and I enjoyed it just as much this year. It’s strange; the novel feels different every time I read it.</p>
<p>The memories of three years ago felt vivid. They really did love the story back then.</p>
<p>That was what I wanted to say.</p>
<p>This reader had left comments every single day and sent messages of encouragement after every milestone.</p>
<p>In short, he was the living embodiment of the name “RepresentativeKimDokja.”</p>
<p>―I don’t know if you remember me.</p>
<p>Of course I do. I can still see the old messages.</p>
<p>I remember writing until the very last second of every deadline, then reading these messages and comments with an exhausted body before finally collapsing into sleep.</p>
<p>If it weren't for the people who endured that time with me, I never would have survived that loneliness. I never would have reached the final sentence.</p>
<p>I hesitated for a moment before reaching for the keyboard. This time, I wanted to reply not as a novelist, but with my own voice.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>―There will be a small fan event tomorrow at 7 PM. If you have time, please come. I’ve prepared a special gift for you as a thank you.</p>
<p>A gift?</p>
<p>―Sorry, but there is an admission fee for the event. I have to make a living too, after all.</p>
<p>At that moment, the prologue of ORV flashed through my mind.</p>
<p>In that prologue, Kim Dokja receives a message from the author, tls123, saying the epilogue will be released for a fee.</p>
<p>It seemed this reader was playing a small, nostalgic joke on me.</p>
<p>I started typing my reply.</p>
<p>―Thank you so much, Reader-nim. But I’ll accept the gift in spirit only. Also, if there's an admission fee… isn’t that a gift I’m technically paying for? (hahaha)</p>
<p>There was no way they had actually prepared a real gift, right?</p>
<p>Even if they had, I couldn't bring myself to accept it. How could I be so shameless when I haven't been able to write a single word of a side story in three years?</p>
<p>By the way, should I delete the (hahaha)? Do people still use that?</p>
<p>I was naively sipping my beer and worrying about trivial things like that, completely unaware of how my life was about to change the very next day.</p>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>
<p>Author’s Note:</p>
<p>This story is a spin-off of “Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint,” yet it does not exist outside the main narrative.</p>
<p>This is still the story of Kim Dokja, but it is not for only one Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>Thank you for waiting.</p>
<p>Once again, let us begin “Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint.”</p>
