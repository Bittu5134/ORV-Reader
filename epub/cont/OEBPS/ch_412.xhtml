<hr/>
<p>Samyeondaesa recalled the moment he first entered the 'Valhalla Hall'. The explosions of cannons and the excited voices of the incarnations.</p>
<p>「"Samyeondaesa-nim."」</p>
<p>The young incarnation's face sparkled with a strange fervor.</p>
<p>「"We've come this far. We've made it. Maybe we can even make it to the final scenario."」</p>
<p>The incarnation he had chosen after much deliberation.</p>
<p>When he first saw the incarnation, the Samyeondaesa hesitated to become their sponsor. Because of their poor overall stats, the incarnation had been shunned by the other constellations.</p>
<p>[The constellation, the 'Careful Star', says it would be foolish to become the sponsor of such an incarnation.]</p>
<p>His observation of that continent's scenario was merely a coincidence. The incarnation of the Korean Peninsula scenario, which he had been observing for a long time, had gone missing, and the Samyeondaesa wandered around the early scenarios for a while, perhaps hoping for a 'what if'. Another hopeful hope: that he might discover another incarnation.</p>
<p>Of course, even Samyeondaesa knew well that such a thing wasn't common. Some stories only happen once in a lifetime, and only after they've passed do we realize that fact.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the constellations lingered and wandered the lower scenario regions because their thirst for stories could only be quenched with stories.</p>
<p>「"Help me! Help me!"」</p>
<p>Even if it wasn't the same story.</p>
<p>「"Please—!"」</p>
<p>The incarnation he discovered was a boy from Connecticut, California.</p>
<p>An incarnation of a different nationality than Samyeondaesa.</p>
<p>With the Korean incarnation already under his control, he couldn't possibly enter into a contract with an incarnation of another nationality.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', is observing you.]</p>
<p>He still can't forget the incarnation's first words, which startled him as he glanced at him.</p>
<p>「"Do you happen to know incarnation Kim Dokja?"」</p>
<p>Only upon hearing the name did the Samyeondaesa realize.</p>
<p>「In fact, the incarnation he truly desired was 'Kim Dokja'.」</p>
<p>But so many constellations desired him, that Samyeondaesa naturally fell down the pecking order of potential partners.</p>
<p>So, at some point, Samyeondaesa decided to become his fan instead of his sponsor.</p>
<p>He doesn't have to be his incarnation. He just wanted to support him. He wanted to enjoy the story of his life together and witness the ■■ of the world he pursues.</p>
<p>But with the end of the Fear Realm, he magically disappeared, leaving only Samyeondaesa, who had supported him, alone.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Maegeumjijon', leaves the channel in search of a new story.]</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Seoaeilpil', leaves the channel in search of a new story.]</p>
<p>Even as the surrounding constellations left the channel one by one, Samyeondaesa remained, hoping that Kim Dokja might reappear somewhere in the world. That's how the past eight years of Samyeondaesa flowed.</p>
<p>「"I want to be like that person."」</p>
<p>Even now, Samyeondaesa couldn't quite explain why he chose to become the sponsor behind the incarnation. Perhaps it was because his blond hair resembled Kim Dokja. Or perhaps his narrowed eyes reminded him of Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>[Samyeondaesa became the sponsor behind 'Noah Kim'.]</p>
<p>Or perhaps it was simply because he knew Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>「"Samyeondaesa, this is a secret."」</p>
<p>Traveling with him was enjoyable.</p>
<p>He was eloquent, and for some unknown reason, he was very fond of Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>「"Samyeondaesa, you may not know this, but I've known you since the beginning."」</p>
<p>He often spoke incomprehensibly. Perhaps even in that way, to Samyeondaesa, he resembled Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>「"I can't explain it well, though."」</p>
<p>Contrary to his initially poor abilities, the incarnation often solved scenarios with surprising ideas. He thought and acted like Kim Dokja, and often, in his sleep, he would tell him strange novel stories.</p>
<p>「"If I knew it would become reality, I would have read more... But the translation here is..."」</p>
<p>Thus, the Connecticut-born incarnation and the Korean-born constellation steadily worked their way through the scenarios. They cleared scenarios 20, 30, and 40. In this way, Samyeondaesa gradually forgot about Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>It wasn't the same joy he felt watching Kim Dokja's story, but he felt a distinct happiness as he built up his story.</p>
<p>Finally, when he reached scenario 80, his incarnation asked,</p>
<p>"Master, will we meet again soon?"</p>
<p>There comes a time when every constellation must give up on its own scenario. The moment he realized that this was the end of the story his life could unfold, the story his light could illuminate.</p>
<p>Some constellations crumble in frustration, while others, seeking to elevate their status, take on even more powerful incarnations.</p>
<p>In that respect, Samyeondaesa was truly fortunate.</p>
<p>"You said you were in scenario number 80, Samyeondaesa."</p>
<p>The incarnation he had nurtured finally reached his scenario.</p>
<p>The moment all constellations yearned for had arrived for him.</p>
<p>[See you in scenario number 85.]</p>
<p>Samyeondaesa was filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>He could finally meet his incarnation. With him, perhaps he could even work on the second half of the scenario he had previously abandoned. He could join forces with his incarnation to complete the scenario, and perhaps even reach the end of this world.</p>
<p>[Fight! Make the Korean Peninsula's status known! Never give up!]</p>
<p>With that single anticipation, Samyeondaesa participated in 'Ragnarok'. He fought against the enemies in the preliminary battle. He aimed his spear and sword at unfamiliar constellations of unfamiliar nationalities, ultimately beheading them.</p>
<p>Leaving behind the wailing screams of the incarnations, he made excuses, believing that this was all inevitable. Believing it was a task he had to undertake to meet the incarnation.</p>
<p>And finally, when he returned victoriously to the audience of this Valhalla Hall...</p>
<p>[The execution ceremony begins.]</p>
<p>His incarnation was on the scaffold.</p>
<hr/>
<p>"So that's what happened."</p>
<p>Samyeondaesa's story was disjointed and incoherent. The story on his face was muddled.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Jung Heewon listened attentively to the end.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', is touched by the consideration of the incarnation 'Jung Heewon'.]</p>
<p>He hadn't expected Jung Heewon to say anything. In fact, even if Jung Heewon had said something, Samyeondaesa wouldn't have been able to hear it. His mind was already seething with the incarnation's final voice.</p>
<p>「"Samyeondaesa."」</p>
<p>The incarnation, waving at him from the execution platform, used his final opportunity to speak to his superior.</p>
<p>「"I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise."」</p>
<p>He still remembered the moment the executioner's blade fell and the incarnation's head fell.</p>
<p>The incarnation rearranged the ridges on his face and barely managed to continue his speech.</p>
<p>[My incarnation was on the 'Prophet's' team.]</p>
<p>In this prelude to 'Ragnarok,' there was a team whose 'defeat' was certain.</p>
<p>The incarnation had heard the rumors well. However, he never imagined that his incarnation would be on that team.</p>
<p>[At first, I hated the Prophet. I thought my incarnation died because of her.]</p>
<p>The constellation, having lost his incarnation, went half-mad.</p>
<p>[If it weren't for her team, my incarnation wouldn't have died.]</p>
<p>All the souls who failed to resurrect in 'Ragnarok' were absorbed into the land of the 'Outpost' and became part of a grand narrative.</p>
<p>On the land where his incarnation died and disappeared, Samyeondaesa cried out quietly.</p>
<p>[That's why I started sponsoring the Prophet.]</p>
<p>The incarnations who receive sponsorship gain the attention of the constellations, and those who receive attention are designated as the next 'Resurrected One'.</p>
<p>[I knew she would be resurrected even without my sponsorship. And yet, I did it anyway...]</p>
<p>As Skuld said, his sponsorship stemmed from a rather base desire.</p>
<p>Samyeondaesa wanted the Prophet, who had caused his incarnation's death, to suffer. He wanted her to be tortured for eternity within the chains of resurrection created by the constellations, clinging to the flimsy thread of hope.</p>
<p>[I watched the Prophet die like that, over and over again, ten times, fifty times, a hundred times... I saw her companions lose and lose again.]</p>
<p>But sitting in the audience of constellations, laughing, chattering, and cursing, watching the Prophet's downfall, Samyeondaesa was overcome by a strange sense of disillusionment.</p>
<p>That day, for the first time, Samyeondaesa noticed that the Prophet, now on the scaffold, was desperately crying out for something.</p>
<p>「"Kill me. I want that incarnation to live, not me."」</p>
<p>As if awakening from a long hypnosis, Samyeondaesa belatedly confirmed the story of the deceased incarnation.</p>
<p>「"I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise."」</p>
<p>Words he hadn't heard because he was so focused on the voice of the incarnation before his death.</p>
<p>Those words rang in Samyeondaesa's ears.</p>
<p>「"Please! Constellations! Save that incarnation! I want him to live!"」</p>
<p>The expression on the Prophet's face as she cried out, pointing precisely at his incarnation. Looking at the prophet, and then at the constellations mocking her, Samyeondaesa wondered, 'Who truly killed his incarnation?'</p>
<p>[I still supported the prophet. However...]</p>
<p>Samyeondaesa gradually increased the amount of support. He sold stories and relics. Every time he did something like that, he knew the ladder to the 'next scenario' would break. Yet, he couldn't stop.</p>
<p>[On a whim, I suddenly wanted to see a certain scene.]</p>
<p>Valhalla Hall filled with cheers. Looking at the audience of constellations, gathered like a solid castle, Samyeondaesa said,</p>
<p>[Just once, to see her win.]</p>
<p>He knew it was impossible. Nevertheless, Samyeondaesa sponsored his coins as if reciting a mantra. He sponsored the prophet and bet on her team. He poured all his coins into it. When his coins were almost depleted, he borrowed money from Skuld.</p>
<p>Knowing full well that it was irreversible, knowing that if he continued like this, this would truly be his last ■■, the missionary did it.</p>
<p>[I'm grateful to you.]</p>
<p>And just now, his last bet was complete.</p>
<p>[You bet on Team 'Zarathustra'.]</p>
<p>The match began, and the battlefield opened. With wild cheers, the constellations on the screen lit up.</p>
<p>[Thanks to you, I was able to make the 'final bet'. If I'd gone this far, even that dead child would understand.]</p>
<p>The golden dice rolled violently in the air.</p>
<p>It was spinning. It was evidence that the constellations were flocking to the gambling table.</p>
<p>[Someone bet on Team 'Veda'.]</p>
<p>[Someone bet on Team 'Veda'.]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The bet just kept growing.</p>
<p>Perhaps the scale of this gambling table would be one of the largest since the opening of 'Valhalla Hong'.</p>
<p>[But let me ask you one thing.]</p>
<p>But the scale of this table wasn't simply because Jung Heewon bet so many coins.</p>
<p>[Why on earth did you... place such an 'additional bet'?]</p>
<p>At the ambassador's words, Jung Heewon saw the 'additional bet condition' flashing in the air.</p>
<p>[There is an 'additional bet condition' in this match!]</p>
<p>[All spectators can bet on the 'additional bet condition'!]</p>
<p>[The 'additional bet condition' is 'when the match ends'.]</p>
<fieldset>
<p>1. The match ends before the first prophecy appears.</p>
<p>2. The match ends after the first prophecy appears.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>That was the 'additional bet' that Jung Heewon had proposed to Skuld.</p>
<p>「"I'll bet on Team 'Zarathustra'. However, I'll place an additional bet on 'the match ending before the first prophecy appears'."」</p>
<p>It was puzzling.</p>
<p>There was absolutely no reason to make such an outrageous bet. Nevertheless, Skuld accepted Jung Heewon's offer.</p>
<p>「"How about an additional 100,000 D-coins?"」</p>
<p>Not just 100,000, but a whopping 200,000 D-coins had flowed into the betting table, and he had no reason to refuse.</p>
<p>[You can never win this bet.]</p>
<p>Samyeondaesa already knew from his long experience. Skuld's 'Golden Dice Special' was a game orchestrated by the so-called big shots.</p>
<p>[Someone bet an additional 5,000 D-coins on 'The match ends after the first prophecy appears!']</p>
<p>[Someone bet an additional 10,000 D-coins on 'The match ends after the first prophecy appears!']</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>As a huge amount of coins flowed into the gambling table, naturally, hidden whales emerged, eager to gobble up the blind money.</p>
<p>But Jung Heewon remained calm.</p>
<p>"No, it's all going according to plan."</p>
<p>The next moment, as if by magic, a surprising change appeared in the stadium.</p>
<p>[Oh, ohhh—!]</p>
<p>Amidst the cheers of the crowd, Samyeondaesa also widened his eyes.</p>
<p>The constellations that had been rushing towards Team Zarathustra, as if ready to crush them at any moment, stopped one by one, leaving their targets right before their eyes.</p>
<p>[Hahahaha! I knew it!]</p>
<p>[Just playing with them!]</p>
<p>Amidst the excited crowd, Samyeondaesa felt goosebumps.</p>
<p>[You, no way.]</p>
<p>Gazing at Jung Heewon, who silently watched the match, Samyeondaesa was amazed by the incarnation's insight.</p>
<p>[To buy the Prophet a little more time…]</p>
<p>The constellations within the battlefield had already conspired with the Skuld's 'big hands'. Therefore, the current situation was clear.</p>
<p>「The constellations within the stadium will not end the match immediately in order to seize Jung Heewon's amassed wealth.」</p>
<p>Jung Heewon likely anticipated this. Jung Heewon had invested a whopping 200,000 D-coins to buy time for Team Zarathustra.</p>
<p>「If this development continues, the Prophet's team can avoid annihilation until the 'First Prophecy' appears.」</p>
<p>Samyeondaesa, moved by Jung Heewon's determination, secretly wiped away tears.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? I bet to win?"</p>
<p>Jung Hweewon muttered something strange.</p>
<p>"Oh, by the way, I don't know how to split that money if I win."</p>
<p>[What on earth are you talking about—]</p>
<p>Samyeondaesa grew anxious. Upon closer inspection, he saw that this incarnation truly intended to win the bet.</p>
<p>[The Prophet's team will truly win…]</p>
<p>And a moment later, Samyeondaesa's eyes widened. While no other constellations noticed, Samyeondaesa was the only one who recognized the incarnation.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon, who was watching the same scene, said,</p>
<p>"Isn't that obvious?"</p>
<p>Screen 4: A man approaches the still constellations of 'Veda' with a menacing air.</p>
<p>Amidst the magical scenery, Samyeondaesa stared blankly at his coat fluttering in the air.</p>
<p>「"Someday, I really want to try a scenario like Kim Dokja."」</p>
<p>Jung Heewon said, as if she understood Samyeondaesa's feelings.</p>
<p>"He's over there."</p>
<p>The incarnation that had been missing for the past eight years was there. The incarnation he had searched for, the incarnation he had longed for. Watching the man gazing up at the constellations with a long, ancient smile, Samyeondaesa</p>
<p>realized what was about to happen.</p>
<p>Perhaps,</p>
<p>[The story of the 'Demon King of Salvation' begins its storytelling.]</p>
<p>It would be his and his incarnation's favorite story.</p>
