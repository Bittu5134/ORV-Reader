<hr/>
<p>'Ways of Survival' features a multitude of beings born from the 'Primal Darkness'. The most prominent example was the 'Wenny King', a creature born alongside the 'Dokkaebi King' in the first Myeongyang. Then there were those who reached the Primal Darkness through the weight of their own myths—beings like the ruler of the abyss, Abaddon, or the lord of the spirit world, Hades. Some had even plummeted into that darkness through their own corruption, such as the Archangel Michael or the high-ranking demon lords. Regardless of their origin, every being that embraced the Primal Darkness shared a singular trait.</p>
<p>「They were already mythical, or existence itself had brought them infinitely close to it.」</p>
<p>The star that had materialized before my eyes was no exception. I knew I would see him eventually, but I never expected to encounter him like this.</p>
<p>"Anna Croft-ssi, stay back. No matter what happens, do not approach."</p>
<p>I shoved her behind me and stepped forward. As if triggered by my movement, a record surged before my eyes.</p>
<p>「The pitch-black shadow of a light dragon shimmered within the thick darkness. Merely meeting its gaze was enough to choke one with pure murderous intent. The most sublime and solemn entity in this universe coiled there, watching me.」</p>
<p>I swallowed hard and recited his epithet.</p>
<p>"Abyssal Black Flame Dragon."</p>
<p>The star that ruled the Nebula &lt;Black Cloud&gt;—the one who had been Han Sooyoung's sponsor in the original story.</p>
<p>「Why is he here? Why has he descended to attack Mitra?」</p>
<p>[No... run...!]</p>
<p>Mitra, struggling beneath the dragon's weight, let out a ragged cry. I looked up at the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon. The entity revealed within the darkness had taken the shape of a colossal black dragon. I opened my mouth to pay my 'respects'.</p>
<p>"Master of the Great &lt;Black Cloud&gt;."</p>
<p>The Black Flame Dragon I remembered was a high-tier Narrative-grade. But the beast before me now was undeniably Mythical. Even the malice radiating from its form was fundamentally different—darker, heavier. How had this happened? Why had he become such a sinister, mythical disaster? I didn't have the luxury of wondering. I needed to buy time.</p>
<p>「The rebound from the 'Demon King of Salvation' form is still tearing at me.」</p>
<p>My strength hadn't fully recovered. If I clashed with a Mythical-grade constellation now, I wouldn't just be reduced to fragments; I’d be erased. And if I failed, Jung Heewon would die with me. I spotted a transparent thicket at the edge of the mythical battlefield.</p>
<p>[The story, 'Regret, Exhaustion, and Obsession', continues its storytelling!]</p>
<p>Heewon's voice resonated from within. She and several other incarnations were huddled inside a transparent barrier. I recognized it immediately.</p>
<p>「Exposed Bush.」</p>
<p>Its function was simple: you could be seen from the outside, but you were immune to damage.</p>
<p>[The 'Exposed Bush' will expire in five minutes.]</p>
<p>The immunity was a one-time grace period. Jung Heewon was tending to the wounded, likely having sought refuge there the moment the myths began their clash. But the bush was situated right at the feet of the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon. Once that timer hit zero, they would be obliterated by the mere aftershocks of the fight.</p>
<p>「I have to stop this fight before that timer runs out.」</p>
<p>"Abyssal Black Flame Dragon!"</p>
<p>He didn't listen. He simply began to crush Mitra beneath a massive, scaled foot.</p>
<p>[Ooooooooooo—!]</p>
<p>Hearing Mitra’s screams, I took another step.</p>
<p>"Can't you hear me?"</p>
<p>A Myth-grade star wouldn't hear the voice of a mere human. I drew a deep breath and cast my incantation.</p>
<p>[Abyssal Black Flame Dragon! You, who are closer to being the 'Final Dragon' than anyone else... how did you end up like this?]</p>
<p>The dragon's head turned slowly toward me. It felt as if the universe's abyss was peering into my soul. I pushed the 'Giant Story' to its limit to keep from collapsing under that gaze.</p>
<p>[I am asking why a Great Constellation such as you is acting as a pawn on this trivial stage.]</p>
<p>In the original text, the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon was a candidate for the 'Final Dragon of the Apocalypse'. But here, he didn't look like a herald of the end. He looked like a puppet.</p>
<p>「Snowfield Kim Dokja blocked the signs of the Holy Demon War in 'The Night of the Blue Witch'.」</p>
<p>The pieces clicked. Because that war never happened in this 41st round, the 'Final Dragon' was never born.</p>
<p>「The prevention of that war... did it break the Black Flame Dragon?」</p>
<p>I didn't know if this was the intended plot of this worldline, but the result was clear.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.???', is activated!]</p>
<p>Deprived of his destiny, he had been consumed by rage and grief, spewing forth a narrative of corruption.</p>
<p>[Are you willing to abandon your pride just because you failed to become the Final Dragon? Did you endure for eons just to become a mindless disaster on a battlefield?]</p>
<p>I never claimed he was a 'good' constellation. He was a being who aspired to be the worst disaster in the &lt;Star Stream&gt;. But...</p>
<p>「There was always a certain purity to the Black Flame Dragon.」</p>
<p>I only knew him through records—perhaps they were just Han Sooyoung’s filtered perceptions. But that’s how we read people.</p>
<p>「The dragon who reveled in Kim Dokja's misfortune but shared a mischievous bond.」</p>
<p>「The immature constellation who believed himself to be a fifteen-year-old child, hiding a bandaged hand.」</p>
<p>「The star that fought to protect a single reader until the very end.」</p>
<p>[That isn't the dragon I knew.]</p>
<p>When we claim to understand someone, we are always telling ourselves a story.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', roars!]</p>
<p>I kept talking, even as the pressure threatened to crush my ribs.</p>
<p>[Even if this is my own arbitrary misreading. Even if this isn't the story of this worldline.]</p>
<p>The story of the 'Demon King of Salvation' poured out of me. I projected the image of the dragon I remembered.</p>
<p>[That was you. I read it. So—]</p>
<p>I was trying to turn reality into one giant incitement.</p>
<p>[I know this isn't your will.]</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', winces in pain.]</p>
<p>The darkness began to shift. Sentences poured out of the void as if to argue with me.</p>
<p>「The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon frowned at the insect before him. How could a human he had never met speak so recklessly of his soul?」</p>
<p>"No... that wasn't you."</p>
<p>「He was an evil dragon. This &lt;Star Stream&gt; was destined to become the ultimate disaster. He was the star that would defeat Mitra here and claim a higher place in mythology.」</p>
<p>[How long will you surrender yourself to a 'record' written by someone else?]</p>
<p>The dragon's massive form stilled. I looked into the shadows behind it. The primal darkness. And then, I heard it. A laughter I loathed.</p>
<p>【That was quite the moving speech.】</p>
<p>I should have known. A star with such a massive ego doesn't just become a 'Mad Dragon' overnight. The world turned a sickly, pale gray. Spacetime warped into the clock of the 'Recorders'. Behind the dragon stood a man in a pitch-black gothic suit.</p>
<p>"Asmodeus."</p>
<p>【It has been a while, Kim Dokja.】</p>
<p>He studied me, his eyes narrowing.</p>
<p>【I've heard the rumors. Have you truly reached 'Myth-grade'?】</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>You can't lie to the 'Recorder of Fear'.</p>
<p>[What are you doing here?]</p>
<p>【What does a Recorder do? I am recording.】</p>
<p>[Release the Black Flame Dragon. Now.]</p>
<p>【And if I refuse?】</p>
<p>[There will be a price.]</p>
<p>Asmodeus laughed.</p>
<p>【A price? From me? You are in no condition to threaten anyone. Do you think you can defeat the 'Mad Dragon King' I am currently writing?】</p>
<p>[Is that the best name you could come up with? Your naming sense is as poor as your record.]</p>
<p>【Sharp tongue. Let's see if it can save you.】</p>
<p>The scenery shattered. The dragon lunged. I spun my 'Giant Story' like a shield. But the dragon's tail bypassed space-time, striking me from a blind spot and wrapping around me with crushing force.</p>
<p>"Hmph...!"</p>
<p>Kudududuk. The stories of the 'Demon King of Salvation' groaned under the pressure.</p>
<p>【As expected... a Myth-grade earned only with a tongue. This is Scenario #85. Did you truly believe you could best a Mythical dragon? I look forward to the expressions of the Great Beings when I present them with your head...】</p>
<p>I didn't panic.</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>Asmodeus's smile faltered.</p>
<p>"Are you truly curious about that?"</p>
<p>"Black Dragon! Finish him—!"</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', unleashes his status!]</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.???', activates to its fullest!]</p>
<p>I poured my essence into a single mantra.</p>
<p>[I am here!]</p>
<p>The voice resonated across the entire battlefield.</p>
<p>[The 'Demon King of Salvation' is here!]</p>
<p>Silence fell. The stars twinkled in anticipation.</p>
<p>[The constellations of the Great Nebula, &lt;Asgard&gt;, have confirmed your location!]</p>
<p>[The constellations of the Great Nebula, &lt;Veda&gt;, have confirmed your location!]</p>
<p>[The constellations of the Great Nebula, &lt;Olympus&gt;, have confirmed your location!]</p>
<p>Asmodeus regained his sneer.</p>
<p>【The Mythical ones on the main battlefield are too busy for you. If you thought they'd come for you—】</p>
<p>[I know they're busy. But that isn't who I called.]</p>
<p>The sound of a bowstring being pulled taut echoed, as if the Earth’s axis itself were being strained.</p>
<p>[The constellations of the Great Nebula, &lt;Emperor&gt;, have confirmed your location!]</p>
<p>A brilliant white light pierced the horizon. Hou Yi was aiming.</p>
<p>「The Ten Fingers of God.」</p>
<p>Asmodeus roared in realization, but he was too late.</p>
<p>[Release him, evil dragon.]</p>
<p>The arrow of the sun ignited the sky.</p>
