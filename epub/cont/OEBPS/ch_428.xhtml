<hr/>
<p>「This is a story about the 'house'.」</p>
<hr/>
<p>Mitra immediately disclosed the coordinates of the 'Missing Bush'.</p>
<p>"How did you know I was looking for that specific thicket?"</p>
<p>Mitra offered only a cryptic, lingering smile. In truth, I didn't need a verbal answer to guess the reason. This 'battlefield' was essentially his personal sanctuary. If Mitra truly desired it, he could likely eavesdrop on every vibration of sound within the 'Valhalla Hall'. If his opponent hadn't been Asmodeus and the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon, a Myth-grade constellation like Mitra would never have been suppressed so easily.</p>
<p>「The map of the super-large battlefield provided by Mitra etched itself clearly into my mind.」</p>
<p>I offered another bow, grateful for his cooperation. Mitra watched me with a pensive look.</p>
<p>[That is all I can provide. I cannot guarantee that the one you seek remains there.]</p>
<p>"Didn't the incarnation you mentioned earlier escape through that very portal?"</p>
<p>[He did. But even if the exit remains the same, there is no promise that you will arrive at the same destination.]</p>
<p>That was true. An exit is merely a gateway. There was no way to determine which path a previous traveler had taken once they crossed the threshold.</p>
<p>[Above all else, the Missing Bush is a portal anchored by the Wennies. There is no guarantee the exit will be located in a safe zone.]</p>
<p>A portal of the Wennies. For a fleeting moment, I considered reaching out to the Wenny King for assistance, but I quickly discarded the thought. Engaging with a being of that magnitude at this stage would demand a price I wasn't prepared to pay.</p>
<p>"I forgot to ask earlier, but when you spoke of escaping the 'Hell of ■■', was that meant as a metaphor?"</p>
<p>Mitra hesitated, the question seemingly catching him off guard.</p>
<p>[You are aware that such a blunt inquiry is considered rude among our kind, aren't you?]</p>
<p>I was belatedly reminded of a specific trait common among Myth-grade entities.</p>
<p>「Constellations who have ascended to 'Myth' status possess a chronic tendency toward equivocation.」</p>
<p>While speaking in riddles is a standard idiom for constellations, the Myth-grade ones were the worst offenders.</p>
<p>「"Those bastards always speak in metaphors and allusions. That’s how they keep themselves free from the binding force of their own [Declarations]."」</p>
<p>In a world constructed entirely of stories, the words of a Great Being carry immense narrative weight. Han Sooyoung had once explained that Myth-grade stars must be masters of rhetoric and ambiguity to avoid being trapped by their own promises.</p>
<p>「"It is their nature to misinterpret others as they see fit. That is why you must pin them down with clear, direct language."」</p>
<p>I ignored Mitra’s discomfort and decided to stick to Han Sooyoung’s strategy.</p>
<p>"I'm a 'T' type personality, so I'm a bit sensitive to vague phrasing."</p>
<p>[T? What is this 'T'?]</p>
<p>It was a throwaway comment; I’d never actually taken an MBTI test.</p>
<p>"It simply means we should avoid using language that is unnecessarily difficult to parse."</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>"What you said sounded like a formal declaration of your intent to abandon this scenario. Therefore, I assume you intend to use the Missing Bush. Am I interpreting you correctly?"</p>
<p>[I am... considering the possibility.]</p>
<p>Unlike the legendary Lee Dansu, who had declared his escape from the 'Hell of ■■' with a stirring mantra, Mitra’s expression remained frustratingly ambiguous. I understood his caution and allowed a small smile.</p>
<p>"Good. Then I suppose I’ll be accompanying you to that bush."</p>
<p>Mitra’s eyes widened as he realized my intent, a flicker of genuine admiration crossing his face.</p>
<p>[I truly admire the weight of that tongue of yours.]</p>
<p>"I'll take that as a compliment."</p>
<p>If I was going to establish a cooperative bond with Mitra, it was better to keep him close until we actually reached the thicket. With a Myth-grade constellation as a traveling companion, Papyrus and the other lingering predators would think twice before approaching. Of course, my motives weren't entirely selfless.</p>
<p>「If the situation turns dire, I can let Mitra enter the 'Missing Bush' first.」</p>
<p>As he had pointed out, the safety of the portal was unverified. Sending a Myth-grade entity in as a scout would be an effective improvisation. He was the Master of the Resurrection Festival, after all; he wouldn't perish easily even if the other side of the portal was a trap. Mitra gave me a sharp, suspicious look, as if he could sense the gears turning in my head, but I maintained a mask of perfect innocence.</p>
<p>"By the way, how exactly am I supposed to use these dice?"</p>
<p>[You will know the moment the 'Round Table' convenes.]</p>
<p>"And when will that be?"</p>
<p>[That...]</p>
<p>The moment he tried to answer, a violent cluster of sparks wreathed his entire body.</p>
<p>[It appears the 'Round Table' does not wish for me to speak on the matter.]</p>
<p>I briefly wondered if he was faking the backlash to avoid the question, but it was a waste of energy to press a being who had no intention of answering.</p>
<p>"Then there’s no issue with us traveling together, right?"</p>
<p>[None. However, there is a lingering matter I must address first.]</p>
<p>A matter to address? I followed Mitra’s gaze and realized I had forgotten something—or someone. About twenty paces away, a lone constellation from a major nebula still loomed.</p>
<p>[Child of &lt;Emperor&gt;, do you still intend to challenge me?]</p>
<p>It was Hou Yi, the Sun Hunter. He remained standing, his massive red bow held steady, glaring in our direction with an unblinking gaze. Mitra frowned, clearly annoyed by his presence.</p>
<p>[If you continue this insolence...]</p>
<p>"Wait a moment."</p>
<p>I held Mitra back and approached the Sun Hunter. Even as I entered his immediate striking range, Hou Yi didn't react. I waved a hand experimentally in front of his face. His pupils didn't even twitch.</p>
<p>"He's out cold?"</p>
<p>It made sense. The White Arrows of the Emperor demanded a staggering amount of probability with every use. In particular, the 'Fourth Finger' he had fired was an arrow that placed an exponential burden on the user based on the 'rank' of the target. Since he had interfered with a 'Recording Contract' involving both a Mythical Constellation and a high-ranking Recorder, the backlash must have been catastrophic. The other &lt;Emperor&gt; constellations had either fled or been annihilated in the previous clash. Seeing the legendary Sun Hunter standing there unconscious in character pajamas was an absurd sight. Then, my eyes drifted to the White Arrow still clutched in his hand.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Could I actually...?</p>
<p>"I truly wonder what goes on inside that head of yours."</p>
<p>Anna Croft sounded as though she had run out of the capacity for surprise.</p>
<p>"You haven't forgotten who he is, have you? He is the Chairman of Valhalla."</p>
<p>"I'm well aware."</p>
<p>Regardless of his current eloquence, Mitra was the one responsible for the hundreds of deaths Anna Croft had suffered in the previous rounds.</p>
<p>"Do you honestly believe you can trust a being like that?"</p>
<p>"Is there any constellation in this world truly worth trusting?"</p>
<p>I glanced back at Mitra, who was currently tending to his subordinates. He was pretending to be occupied, but I knew he was using his status to eavesdrop.</p>
<p>"He has his own agenda, and I have mine. It's a mutually beneficial arrangement. Don't overthink it."</p>
<p>Sensing my skepticism toward the god, Anna’s expression softened slightly.</p>
<p>"What are you doing now?"</p>
<p>"Oh, this?"</p>
<p>I was currently in the middle of rubbing the 'Ten Fingers of God'—which I'd pilfered from the catatonic Hou Yi—against the 'Thoughts of Almost Everything'.</p>
<p>[Item: 'Thoughts of Almost Everything' — Mimicry Proficiency is increasing!]</p>
<p>Normally, it was nearly impossible for 'Thoughts' to mimic a relic of this caliber. However, the item had evolved significantly. Now, even a Mythical-grade artifact was within its reach.</p>
<p>[Item: 'Thoughts of Almost Everything' — Mimicry is progressing rapidly!]</p>
<p>The specific condition for this 'Mimicry Form' was 'rubbing the item one thousand times'. It was a tedious but effective requirement.</p>
<p>[The sacred relic, 'Ten Fingers of God', emits a faint, pained hum!]</p>
<p>As expected of a relic belonging to the Five Emperors, the arrows vibrated in my hand with every pass. I ignored the tingling sensation and kept going. Finally...</p>
<p>['Mimicry Form' successfully acquired!]</p>
<p>A completion message flashed in my vision. At that exact moment, Hou Yi gasped, his consciousness returning with a jolt.</p>
<p>[Ugh!]</p>
<p>His eyes snapped to the relic in my hand, his expression turning sharp.</p>
<p>[What are you doing with that?]</p>
<p>"Just admiring the craftsmanship. It's a remarkable piece."</p>
<p>I was effectively stealing the data of his soul's weapon. I gave him a shameless smile and handed the 'Ten Fingers of God' back. Hou Yi took the arrow, inspecting it with a bewildered look.</p>
<p>[How were you even able to hold this? This relic is designed to reject anyone but a permitted wielder.]</p>
<p>Standard procedure for high-level artifacts. The 'Ten Fingers of God' possessed the 'Thousand-Year Interrogation', a passive curse that inflicted excruciating psychological agony on unauthorized users. For me, however, it was a non-factor.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall', is active!]</p>
<p>Hou Yi, unaware of my immunity, looked at me with newfound respect.</p>
<p>[Perhaps the Emperor holds you in higher regard than I thought. To think he would allow you to touch his 'fingers'...]</p>
<p>In reality, I had just committed a form of narrative larceny by rubbing my 'thoughts' all over his arrows. Fortunately, the actual Emperor seemed too preoccupied with the higher scenarios to notice someone playing with his gear.</p>
<p>"Anyway, what happened to the rest of your group?"</p>
<p>[My group?]</p>
<p>"The ones who arrived with you."</p>
<p>Hou Yi scanned the ruined horizon.</p>
<p>[Most have fled. Others were likely repatriated to the higher scenarios. A general recall order was issued during the fighting.]</p>
<p>A return order?</p>
<p>[There is a crisis unfolding in the upper tiers. An emergency summons was broadcast to all high-ranking units.]</p>
<p>I didn't know the specifics, but it was clear that something monumental was happening on the main battlefield.</p>
<p>"Regardless, thank you for the intervention. I wouldn't have survived Asmodeus without you."</p>
<p>I was being sincere. Fighting Asmodeus and a berserk dragon simultaneously would have been a death sentence. Hou Yi accepted the thanks with practiced indifference.</p>
<p>[I had my own motives. It was merely a coincidence that our interests aligned.]</p>
<p>"Do you still intend to deliver me to &lt;Emperor&gt;?"</p>
<p>[I have no such intention.]</p>
<p>"Wasn't that your primary mission?"</p>
<p>Hou Yi blinked, then slowly shook his head.</p>
<p>[If a contract is not paid, there is no obligation to fulfill it. My term was the location of my Transcendent comrades. You have yet to provide that information.]</p>
<p>I had fully intended to keep my word, but his bluntness was refreshing.</p>
<p>"Right. I'll tell you what I know."</p>
<p>Since we had a few minutes before moving toward the Missing Bush, I briefed him on the Transcendents I had encountered. I started with the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, Namgung Minyeong—covering the events in the Realm of Fear, the New Murim District, and the 'World Tree Project' the constellations had attempted to force on her.</p>
<p>[I see. So she was there...]</p>
<p>Hou Yi listened with rapt attention, his expression fluctuating between sorrow and fury. His emotional transparency was surprising; Jung Heewon, who had been listening nearby, finally spoke up.</p>
<p>"Are you truly a friend of the Master?"</p>
<p>[I'd like to believe so. Though she might have a different opinion.]</p>
<p>His tone was uncharacteristically humble. Jung Heewon, meeting someone who actually remembered the Sword Saint with such clarity for the first time, took over the storytelling. She filled in the details I had missed. Hou Yi nodded solemnly, his empathy for the Transcendents palpable.</p>
<p>[So, her story now resides with you?]</p>
<p>"It does."</p>
<p>[That explains the resonance I felt when I first saw you...]</p>
<p>Hou Yi gazed at me with a look of profound longing before composing himself.</p>
<p>[And what of Kyrgios and Cheok Jungyeong?]</p>
<p>"I don't have all the details. But I know Master Kyrgios has already ascended to the 'Main Battlefield'."</p>
<p>[As I expected.]</p>
<p>He seemed to have anticipated as much.</p>
<p>"Do you plan to find him?"</p>
<p>[The end of the world is approaching. I should like to share one final glass with my friends before the starlight fades.]</p>
<p>It was startling to find a constellation within a nebula like &lt;Emperor&gt; who was driven by such romantic notions as friendship. I asked him sincerely:</p>
<p>"If you find them... could you let me know?"</p>
<p>Hou Yi nodded without hesitation.</p>
<p>[I will. It is destiny that I met my friend's successor. Kyrgios and Jungyeong would be proud of what you've become.]</p>
<p>"I doubt that."</p>
<p>With that, my discussions with both Mitra and Hou Yi concluded. All that remained was the journey to the Missing Bush. I was about to ask if the Sun Hunter would join us when he spoke in a low, sharp voice.</p>
<p>[What do you intend to do about that?]</p>
<p>That? I followed his line of sight.</p>
<p>[If you wish, I can sever its tether here and now.]</p>
<p>I quickly moved to stop him as he reached for his bow.</p>
<p>"No, that won't be necessary."</p>
<p>In the direction he was aiming, the gargantuan form of the Black Flame Dragon had yet to fully dissipate. I wasn't sure why the descent was lingering, but provoking it further was a bad idea.</p>
<p>[Why? That beast intended to erase you.]</p>
<p>"It wasn't his will. Not truly."</p>
<p>[Not his will? You believe a star's actions can be separated from its intent?]</p>
<p>"In this world, stories determine existence. Sometimes, the story is a lie."</p>
<p>Hou Yi’s eyes sparkled with curiosity.</p>
<p>[You believe the stories are 'wrong'? Do you think the evil or the good narratives he carries do not represent the core of his being?]</p>
<p>I knew that stories didn't account for everything. Actions were the intersection of will and narrative. But I felt a strange need to defend him.</p>
<p>"I don't know the whole truth. But if it's a false record, I might be able to fix it."</p>
<p>As his temporary recorder, I had the authority to interfere with his history. I could use my status to peer into his past and understand why he had become this corrupted entity.</p>
<p>[The stories of the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' are responding to your presence!]</p>
<p>As I approached, the dragon's incarnation body began to dissolve into motes of shadow, as if it had been waiting for me to arrive. I thought it was the end of the encounter, but as the smoke cleared, my heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>「My breath caught in my throat.」</p>
<p>In the space where the dragon's massive form had stood, lying amidst the fading pitch-black smoke, was a person I knew very well.</p>
