<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">978 Episode 58 Myth-grade Constellation (10)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>Asmodeus's eyes were etched with pure disbelief. The white arrow of the divine being, still buried in his chest, pulsed with a blinding radiance as it unleashed its intended authority.</p>
<p>[The effect of the sacred relic, 'Ten Fingers of God', is activated!]</p>
<p>The strike was an undeniable success. Yet, seeing Asmodeus’s bewildered expression and hearing the tremor in his voice, a cold sense of foreboding washed over me.</p>
<p>【How could this... happen...】</p>
<p>It was Asmodeus. Could that twisted Demon King, the architect of the Cinema and a veteran of the records, truly have been caught so completely off guard?</p>
<p>【...Did you truly expect me to say that?】</p>
<p>I knew it. Asmodeus glanced toward Hou Yi, who was watching from the horizon, before shifting his gaze back to me.</p>
<p>【I commend the effort. Using the Emperor's arrow to sever my tether... it was a quintessentially Kim Dokja-like strategy.】</p>
<p>[I'll take the compliment, but it isn't what I'm looking for right now.]</p>
<p>Asmodeus’s entire presence began to vibrate with a sinister frequency. Despite the arrow piercing his origin, he showed no sign of agony. Instead, he gripped the shaft with a steady hand, his eyes locking onto mine with an intense, predatory focus.</p>
<p>【However, this is not enough to stop the record.】</p>
<p>[The constellations of the nebula, &lt;Emperor&gt;, are astonished by the resilience of the Great Recorder!]</p>
<p>I was reminded once more why he was the 'Recorder of Fear'. Even other recorders trembled at his name.</p>
<p>【Borrowing the power of others will never bring you the conclusion you crave.】</p>
<p>His words weren't even imbued with [Incite], yet each one felt like an arrow of its own, piercing through my mental defenses.</p>
<p>【If you truly wish to be Kim Dokja, you must not hesitate. You must learn to interpret, destroy, and deny the world with a violence greater than anything you have read.】</p>
<p>For a moment, his face looked strangely mournful. Beneath the mocking facade, I sensed a simmering, ancient rage. Just as my own emotions were inextricably tied to Kim Dokja’s, Asmodeus held a chaotic mass of feelings within him that had never been fully recorded—a melting pot of unwritten grief.</p>
<p>The sentences overflowing from his status began to suppress the light of Di Ku.</p>
<p>「The one who had stepped beyond the boundaries of history to conquer death itself stood before me.」</p>
<p>Even I had to admire his sheer tenacity. If even the Emperor's arrows couldn't subdue him, what options were left? Would I truly have to face the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon in a fight to the death? Could I even pull off the 'Great King of Fear' form in my current state?</p>
<p>【Even if it were me. In the end, you—】</p>
<p>Asmodeus’s voice faltered. A faint sound echoed through the achromatic field.</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>It was thin, like the buzzing of an insect or the distant chirp of a bird. No. As I listened closer, the sound took on a heart-wrenching clarity.</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>It was the cry of a child. Asmodeus’s brow furrowed as he glared into the empty air.</p>
<p>【Are you truly trying to interrupt me now?】</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>【Even you... at a time like this...】</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>Who was he talking to? His expression shifted rapidly—from anger to frustration, and finally, to a weary resignation.</p>
<p>A strange premonition gripped me. Was he actually talking to that being?</p>
<p>【Yes, I understand. Enough. Silence.】</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>【I couldn't help it. Even a recorder has a heart. Especially the incarnation body of that dragon, whom I once...】</p>
<p>The murmur echoed one last time, and Asmodeus let out a heavy, defeated sigh.</p>
<p>【Fine. I will leave the Black Dragon behind. I have no choice.】</p>
<p>Asmodeus’s incarnation body began to blur, losing its definition. He was voluntarily withdrawing from the stage.</p>
<p>[The Recorder of Fear, 'Demon King of the Cinema', has suffered a critical blow and is exiting the scenario!]</p>
<p>[The Recorder of Fear, 'Demon King of the Cinema', has redacted his own records, mitigating some of the penalty!]</p>
<p>[The effect of the 'Ten Fingers of God' temporarily severs the contract between the Recorder and the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon!]</p>
<p>I reached out as he faded.</p>
<p>[Asmodeus!]</p>
<p>His inscription manifested before my eyes one last time.</p>
<p>「Asmodeus offered a leisurely smile, as if delivering the perfect exit line for a villain.」</p>
<p>【Kim Dokja, do not let this myth-grade status go to your head. Your true enemy is already orchestrating the end of this world, far beyond your reach.】</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>【Fight to the bitter end with that masterful tongue of yours. I truly wonder... what sentence will eventually mark your death?】</p>
<p>He vanished completely, leaving only a faint afterimage that slipped through my fingers.</p>
<p>【I leave the Black Flame Dragon in your care—for the time being.】</p>
<p>The moment he disappeared, a deluge of messages erupted in my mind.</p>
<p>[Your monumental achievements resonate across the &lt;Star Stream&gt;!]</p>
<p>[You have acquired a new 'Mythical Story'!]</p>
<p>[The Administration Bureau is deeply moved by your rapid growth!]</p>
<p>[Several Great Dokkaebis have requested a 'Private Meeting' with you!]</p>
<p>[Various nebulae invite you to participate in the 'Context of the Constellation'!]</p>
<p>[The Recorders of Fear are searching the 'Records Archive' for your history!]</p>
<p>[You have been granted a temporary 'Recording Contract'!]</p>
<p>[You are now the acting Recorder for the constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon'!]</p>
<p>「Yes. You are finally coming.」</p>
<p>I must have lost consciousness for a few minutes. When the world finally stopped spinning, I felt someone roughly shaking my shoulder.</p>
<p>"Kim Dokja!"</p>
<p>Anna Croft's face was ashen. She was gripping my shoulder with enough force to crack the bone.</p>
<p>"It... it hurts, Anna."</p>
<p>"Are you awake?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I'm fine. Mostly."</p>
<p>I gently pried her hand away. My shoulder felt like it had been through a hydraulic press. Anna supported my weight as I tried to steady my breathing.</p>
<p>"Are you certain you're alright?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. What about Asmodeus?"</p>
<p>"Asmodeus?"</p>
<p>I realized she didn't know his true name. In this worldline, he was only known by the title 'Demon King of the Cinema'. I didn't have the energy to explain the complex history of the 1,864th round.</p>
<p>"What about the Black Flame Dragon?"</p>
<p>Anna pointed toward the ground. There, curled into a defensive posture, lay the pitch-black form of the dragon.</p>
<p>[The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon's complete descent has been terminated.]</p>
<p>With Asmodeus's probability withdrawn, the dragon had lost its anchor. It was dispersing slowly, its presence no longer justified by the scenario's rules.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is looking at you.]</p>
<p>I felt a strange, hollow longing in that message. I couldn't tell which version of him was looking at me—the one from the 41st round or the one I remembered—but the goodwill was unmistakable.</p>
<p>"Dokja-ssi!"</p>
<p>Jung Heewon had emerged from the 'Exposed Bush' and was rushing toward us. She checked my face with frantic eyes.</p>
<p>"Are you okay? Where are you hurt?"</p>
<p>"I'm fine, Heewon-ssi. Are you safe?"</p>
<p>"I'm alright. But... how did you do it? That dragon looked like it was going to destroy the world, but the moment you stood in its way, it just... stopped."</p>
<p>[Several constellations wish to hear the details of your feat!]</p>
<p>I couldn't exactly explain that I’d just had a high-stakes debate with a primal demon king.</p>
<p>"I just held his attention for a while. A staring contest, you could say."</p>
<p>[Some constellations are moved by your indomitable spirit!]</p>
<p>[You have acquired a new story!]</p>
<p>[You have acquired the mythical story, 'Adversary of the Dragon'!]</p>
<p>[You have acquired the legendary story, 'Master of the Staring Contest'!]</p>
<p>'Adversary of the Dragon' was a rare prize, usually reserved for those who survived the Apocalypse scenarios. The staring contest one was... well, a bonus.</p>
<p>But the peace didn't last.</p>
<p>"Kim Dokja!"</p>
<p>Anna Croft’s voice was sharp with warning. I turned to see the surrounding constellations closing in. These were the hunters of the various nebulae who had been lurking, waiting for the myths to exhaust each other.</p>
<p>「To stop the dragon, I had effectively summoned every predator in the region to my location.」</p>
<p>The real battle was only just beginning. Every star here wanted a piece of a Myth-grade target. The first to step forward were the Narrative-grade stalkers from &lt;Papyrus&gt;.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Black Wolf Reaper', unleashes its status!]</p>
<p>The air grew thick with aggression, but the constellations held back, eyeing each other warily. No one wanted to be the first to draw the 'Demon King of Salvation's' ire.</p>
<p>[Demon King of Salvation.]</p>
<p>It was Anubis, the Black Wolf Reaper, who spoke first.</p>
<p>[I have come to collect you. Join &lt;Papyrus&gt;.]</p>
<p>The arrogance was staggering. Even Olympus had learned to tread carefully around me.</p>
<p>"And if I decline?"</p>
<p>I still held the status of my 'Demon King' form. I wasn't about to bow to a wolf just because he was baring his teeth. Anubis didn't seem surprised.</p>
<p>[You are free to refuse, of course.]</p>
<p>His eyes shifted away from me, settling on Jung Heewon and Anna Croft. Both women tensed instantly. Anubis hadn't given up; he had simply changed his leverage.</p>
<p>[However, &lt;Papyrus&gt; will remember this decision. We have a very long memory.]</p>
<p>I felt a cold smile touch my lips. It wasn't exactly a subtle threat. I gripped my scepter, weighing my options. I was outnumbered, and my stories were fraying.</p>
<p>「Can I protect them both if I unleash the 'Great King of Fear' now?」</p>
<p>I was prepared to pay the price, but then—</p>
<p>[Step back, Anubis.]</p>
<p>A giant wreathed in light stepped between us.</p>
<p>[An announcement is issued to all constellations present!]</p>
<p>Mitra, despite his tattered wings and broken status, stood as a shield before me.</p>
<p>[If you lay a hand on the Demon King of Salvation, you will answer to me.]</p>
<p>He was still a Myth-grade constellation. There wasn't a Narrative-grade being on the field willing to gamble their life against him. Anubis snarled, his teeth clicking together.</p>
<p>[We withdraw.]</p>
<p>As the &lt;Papyrus&gt; forces retreated into the shadows, the other constellations followed suit. They had realized that, for today, I was untouchable. Mitra turned back to me once the field was clear.</p>
<p>[Demon King of Salvation.]</p>
<p>I faced him, my guard still up. He was a constellation of &lt;Veda&gt;, after all. They were just as greedy as the rest. But instead of an attack, the massive entity slowly lowered himself onto one knee.</p>
<p>[I offer my sincere respects to you.]</p>
<p>The staff of the Golden Dice Hall followed his lead, prostrating themselves in the dirt.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Lord of December 25th', pays its respects!]</p>
<p>[The constellations of the Golden Dice Hall offer their tribute!]</p>
<p>It was a surreal sight. The records of the 'Unchanging One' flickered in my mind. This was the moment—the formal recognition of the 'Demon King of Salvation' as a true Myth-grade existence by the Master of Valhalla.</p>
<p>My heart hammered in my chest. I felt a tectonic shift in the rules of my reality.</p>
<p>「This universe is nothing more than a game of dice played by the gods.」</p>
<p>The world felt suddenly distant, a dizzying sensation pulling at my soul, much like when I had first ascended.</p>
<p>「And in that great game, he has finally earned his own dice.」</p>
<p>[You have earned the right to participate in the 'Round Table of Myths'!]</p>
