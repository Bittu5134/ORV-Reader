<hr/>
<p>—You really made that bet?</p>
<p>Anna Croft, having heard everything I said, looked as shocked as I had when I read the 'Apocalypse Prophecy'.</p>
<p>"Yes, well."</p>
<p>—We could have failed. If the constellations hadn't intervened in the bet, we could have been annihilated.</p>
<p>I looked at the 'golden dice' shining brightly in the air and said,</p>
<p>"I knew they'd intervene."</p>
<p>Before answering the summons, I told Jung Heewon about the bet in the 'Hall of Golden Dice'.</p>
<p>「"When the betting table opens, be sure to place a bet according to the 'betting conditions' I mentioned. I'll give you the D-coins in advance."」</p>
<p>The D-coins in the Ascension Hall are also used in higher-level scenarios. However, judging by the state of Valhalla Hall, the 'D-coins' in this area were already practically drying up.</p>
<p>"They absolutely need D-Coins to survive. There are only two ways to secure them in this area: win the game or—"</p>
<p>—Steal them from other incarnations or constellations.</p>
<p>I nodded. As expected, the clever Kim Anna had already figured out my intentions. Well, it was even stranger that Anna Croft, a former Las Vegas gambler, didn't know that.</p>
<p>「Skuld's 'Hall of Golden Dice' is one of Asgard's core corrupt events.」</p>
<p>All the bets in the hall were rigged by Skuld, the organizer, and a few 'whales'.</p>
<p>"With the blind money rolling in, there's no way they wouldn't act."</p>
<p>—Do you have any idea what you could do with that much D-Coins?</p>
<p>200,000 D-Coins. Enough to build a team of elite warriors, or even better.</p>
<p>In short, if those D-Coins were converted into summoning costs…</p>
<p>—You were definitely going to win the next match.</p>
<p>"Does that mean we're giving up this match?"</p>
<p>—You could be the next one to be resurrected.</p>
<p>"Then you're going to die."</p>
<p>—I'm not afraid of death anymore.</p>
<p>Do people who've experienced the same world hundreds of times all say similar things?</p>
<p>A gloomy story permeated her body, having endured hundreds of 'preliminary battles'.</p>
<p>And I knew what that story foreshadowed.</p>
<p>「Regression depression.」</p>
<p>Kim Anna suffered from 'regression depression'. If Yoo Joonghyuk had heard about it, he'd have been so shocked he'd have eaten dirt.</p>
<p>In any case, knowing the symptoms, I couldn't just ignore it, so I spoke.</p>
<p>"You're okay, but what about Selena Kim?"</p>
<p>'Regression depression' is a mental illness that corrodes the spirit of the incarnation, but there's one extreme solution: to place an even heavier burden on the regressor's heavy shoulders.</p>
<p>"If you give up so easily, what are the people who trusted you and participated in this competition going to do?"</p>
<p>This was the contradiction of 'regression depression'. The more the regressor reflected on their responsibilities and duties, the more they struggled to regain their sanity amidst the pain. Reclaim it.</p>
<p>Of course, the price would be worse the next time depression struck, but for now, there was no other way.</p>
<p>"Get your head together. We haven't lost yet."</p>
<p>Fortunately, it seemed to have worked, as Anna Croft's gaze began to brighten.</p>
<p>—Anyway… It's a shame you used the D-Coins like that. If it were those D-Coins…</p>
<p>"I also know how much 200,000 D-Coins are worth."</p>
<p>But here, I absolutely had to use them.</p>
<p>"If I was just going to win one game and move up, like you said, I wouldn't have used them either."</p>
<p>—What's that…</p>
<p>"Anyway, since we have time, let's do what we can. Let's…"</p>
<p>I slowly turned my gaze. Anna Croft also turned her head in my direction.</p>
<p>There.</p>
<p>There was Selena Kim, concentrating, making a specific hand gesture.</p>
<p>「Search Fox.」</p>
<p>Selena Kim's unique skill, which allows her to search the battlefield by summoning small fox guardian spirits.</p>
<p>I slowly opened my eyes and asked her, "Have you found the 'Bush'?"</p>
<p>Selena Kim nodded and relayed something to me through telepathy. For a moment, I felt the eyes of the battlefield turn towards me.</p>
<p>Anna Croft's telepathy came.</p>
<p>—Isn't that why you've been talking so much...</p>
<p>I gave a faint nod to the clever Anna Kim.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Thunderbird', is wary of you.]</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'General of Banara', wants to uncover your scheme.]</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Progenitor of Humanity', is curious about what you're up to.]</p>
<p>They're pretending not to hear me, but... There's no way those sinister bastards wouldn't listen to me. An incarnation that's undeniably intimidating from the moment they meet is babbling such nonsense. What constellation wouldn't be interested?</p>
<p>—Was your goal from the beginning to buy time to find the 'bush'?</p>
<p>I deliberately opened my mouth to keep the constellations' attention on me. That way, Selena Kim's search foxes could be active.</p>
<p>「The missing bush. A 'disaster-level fear' that's said to randomly appear during every match. The incarnations who go missing through this bush have never returned to the stadium or the 'Valhalla Hall'.」</p>
<p>I had just received information about the various bushes hidden in this area from the 'Unchanging One'.</p>
<p>I briefly glanced over the bushes' appearance conditions and then slowly turned around.</p>
<p>There were the incarnations of our team, still trembling in fear.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by the constellations' aura, the incarnations were frozen in place, unable to fight or flee. I stared at them silently, opening my mouth.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill, 'Incite LV.???' activated!]</p>
<p>"Everyone."</p>
<p>I felt everyone's gaze focused on me.</p>
<p>"I won't ask you to fight with me."</p>
<p>With the current level of [Incite], I could temporarily awaken the constellations from their fear.</p>
<p>"This is a battle with no clear chance of winning, so why risk your life fighting?"</p>
<p>Regardless of how they got here, the fact that they've reached Scenario 85 means they're among the elite in their region.</p>
<p>These incarnations have accumulated a fair amount of stories and have a certain understanding of the mechanics of this 'Star Stream'. They don't need complicated words of encouragement.</p>
<p>"Run. It's not shameful, so run until the very end. That's the last fight you can have on this damned battlefield."</p>
<p>The words I delivered with [Incite] were just empty, meaningless words anyone could say. Words I wouldn't have even bothered to utter.</p>
<p>"Survive, please."</p>
<p>Even so, the reason I opened my mouth to speak was simple.</p>
<p>「For some, even the courage to run is a luxury.」</p>
<p>Words telling them not to give up. Words telling them to live. Words that could be spoken purely for the sake of someone's survival, in a world filled with spectacle and mockery.</p>
<p>"Follow me, everyone! I know where the bushes are!"</p>
<p>Selena Kim exchanged glances with me and began to run, and one of the previously hesitant incarnations began to chase after her.</p>
<p>"Uuugh!"</p>
<p>"I've been trying to die here all this time—"</p>
<p>"Die only! I won't die!"</p>
<p>As if trying to give meaning to my empty cheers, the incarnations began to run away, screaming desperately.</p>
<p>However, the unfortunate truth was this:</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Thunderbird,' laughs derisively.]</p>
<p>This &lt;Star Stream&gt; was particularly cruel to the desperate struggles of the incarnations.</p>
<p>[I never said I'd let them go, though.]</p>
<p>A bolt of lightning struck from the air, and the Thunderbird's lightning struck right in front of Selena Kim's nose.</p>
<p>"Kwaaaaaaa!"</p>
<p>The incarnations running ahead screamed and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The reason the constellations refused to let us go was clear. They were holding on, not killing us, because of the stakes in the 'bet'.</p>
<p>The reason they were holding us back now was probably to save them the trouble of searching for us, who had been scattered.</p>
<p>I briefly held back the dark clouds created by the Thunderbird. I looked at him and walked towards him.</p>
<p>"Newbies need to be treated warmly. Do you think your game will work properly if all the newbies quit? Oh, you didn't read that far?"</p>
<p>[Huh?]</p>
<p>"『Even a novice can master the game in a week』."</p>
<p>[How did you get that item...?]</p>
<p>I took a quick breath, then circulated the story in my heart strongly.</p>
<p>「'Demon King of Salvation' mode is activated.」</p>
<p>[The story, 'Demon King of Salvation', begins its storytelling!]</p>
<p>Along with the dazzling story that enveloped my entire body, [Way of the Wind] took hold at my feet. I soared into the air, overlaying [Baekcheongganggi] on my 'Unbreakable Faith'. I swung my sword towards the sky, and a surge of electricity struck the dark clouds in the sky. The dark clouds, crushed by my attack, instantly disintegrated.</p>
<p>[Go.]</p>
<p>The incarnations, hastily regaining their senses at my mantra, began to run again. Perhaps because they were concerned about me. The constellations didn't rush to chase the incarnations.</p>
<p>Instead, on the battlefield. They were curious about my display of aura.</p>
<p>[As expected, he's got a hidden plan.]</p>
<p>Unlike in 'New Murim District', the constellations didn't seem overly flustered despite my aura.</p>
<p>[Didn't I say so?]</p>
<p>[It seems he's sponsored by some small or medium-sized constellation.]</p>
<p>The 'Demon King of Salvation' mode radiates aura comparable to that of a late-stage narrative-grade.</p>
<p>But over there, there were three constellations that reached the late-stage narrative-grade.</p>
<p>Even the rest of the team were at least mid-stage narrative-grade, so it seemed they wouldn't lose their composure.</p>
<p>[I don't know which one, but it wouldn't be bad for entertainment.]</p>
<p>The constellations each began to radiate aura, as if ready to easily trample on me.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Thunderbird', releases its aura!]</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'General of Banara', releases its aura!]</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Progenitor of Humanity', releases its aura!]</p>
<p>Anna Croft hurriedly intervened in the heated atmosphere of the battlefield.</p>
<p>"Constellations! Everyone, please stop! Have you forgotten that there's a wager at stake?"</p>
<p>The 'General of Banaras' responded with a sarcastic remark.</p>
<p>[The wager was 'that the match wouldn't end until the first prophecy was fulfilled'. The match wouldn't end just because one of them was killed.]</p>
<p>Watching the approaching constellations, I pulled Anna Croft back.</p>
<p>Anna Croft spoke, seemingly frustrated with the situation.</p>
<p>—Why on earth is this happening?</p>
<p>Did I do something wrong? With all the incarnations fleeing, we can't even have a final showdown.</p>
<p>"It's right to save at least one more person, Miss Kim Anna. You should go too."</p>
<p>—No.</p>
<p>"I don't need your help. You don't even know the future, so even if you stay by my side, it's useless."</p>
<p>In the thick silence, the pain she felt was palpable. But right now, there was no time to dwell on it.</p>
<p>"Help Selena Kim. You know this is her 'first match'."</p>
<p>"It's not just the constellations that are at risk on the battlefield. Are you just going to let them die like this?"</p>
<p>While lacking in strength and skill, no player has gained more experience in this 'outpost' than Anna Croft. Just having her with them will greatly increase the survival chances of Selena Kim and the Incarnations.</p>
<p>[A new story is sprouting within incarnation 'Anna Croft'!]</p>
<p>If she can successfully complete this 'outpost', she will receive compensation for her long suffering.</p>
<p>So—</p>
<p>"You haven't forgotten your plan, have you? Hide well and gather the 'prophecies'. That's the only way we can win."</p>
<p>At least she can't die here.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about me. You know who I am. I'm the Evil Sophist, the One Who Deceived the Stars…"</p>
<p>—You're not Cheon Inho, are you?</p>
<p>I never expected her to say that.</p>
<p>That's right. Now, I wasn't 'Cheon Inho' to her. I wasn't the 'Evil Sophist' or 'the One Who Deceived the Stars'.</p>
<p>—Mr. Kim End-nim.</p>
<p>She called me by a name that only meant something to me.</p>
<p>—If you say that, then there must be a reason. I guess I'll have to listen to you again, helpless and stupid.</p>
<p>"It's nice to hear that. Have I gained some trust now?"</p>
<p>—I don't trust you. I just…</p>
<p>With the rustle of her clothes, I felt Anna Croft turn away. She had finally made up her mind.</p>
<p>—I'm just trusting your 'bet'.</p>
<p>Hearing her footsteps retreat, I let out a light sigh.</p>
<p>—The person I know, the one who puts their life on the line, would have no reason to make such a risky bet.</p>
<p>It seems I couldn't fool her, even if I didn't know about others.</p>
<p>I looked up at the small golden dice that had been floating above my head for a while. This small dice was a symbol that only appeared to those who participated in the bets of the 'Hall of Golden Dice'.</p>
<p>[Could it be, that guy... made a bet?]</p>
<p>Several of the constellations frowned, as if they had belatedly noticed the symbol.</p>
<p>A small golden dice was also floating above their heads.</p>
<p>[Hahahahaha! Could it be that someone had placed a coin on the Prophet's team? Is that right?]</p>
<p>"But."</p>
<p>[You're crazy. You don't really think they'll win, do you?]</p>
<p>"Are there people who bet money thinking they'll lose?"</p>
<p>[What nonsense are you talking about? Do you really believe you can collect all the prophecies?]</p>
<p>"Oh, actually, that's a lie."</p>
<p>[You're currently participating in a bet at the 'Hall of Golden Dice'.]</p>
<p>[You bet on Team 'Zarathustra'.]</p>
<p>"Actually, I can win even without collecting prophecies."</p>
<p>[You placed an additional bet on 'End of match before the first prophecy appears!']</p>
<p>The constellations, with bitter smiles on their faces, turned to each other and said.</p>
<p>[You're in good spirits. How much did you bet? 1,000 D-coins.]</p>
<p>[Still, you seem like a good player. You must have bet around 10,000 D-coins.]</p>
<p>Listening to their advice, I recalled the words of the 'Mass Production Manufacturer'.</p>
<p>「"Coins are truly fascinating, aren't they? They're just numbers, but depending on the number of coins, the constellations can mock someone, be jealous of someone, or even show their greed."」</p>
<p>[No, he might have bet as much as 100,000 D-Coins.]</p>
<p>The 'General of Banara' bared his teeth and thrust his club at me.</p>
<p>[No matter how much you bet, the outcome of this bet won't change.]</p>
<p>"You think so?"</p>
<p>That was when the constellations' expressions changed.</p>
<p>[Wait! Wait. Just now…]</p>
<p>I could tell even without activating [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint]. They were probably hearing something unusual right now.</p>
<p>[Someone bet on that team.]</p>
<p>[What? Some crazy guy—]</p>
<p>[How much did he bet?]</p>
<p>The voice of the Mass-Production Manufacturer overlapped their expressions, which were changing in real time.</p>
<p>「"The real fun comes when the amount of those coins gets really large."」</p>
<p>Some amounts elicit ridicule, some envy, and some greed.</p>
<p>And some—</p>
<p>[That's, like, impossible! No matter how crazy—]</p>
<p>"Why are you all doing that?"</p>
<p>The mere existence of it inspires a kind of awe.</p>
<p>The constellations began to back away, as if they could see the numbers floating above my head.</p>
<p>I grinned at them.</p>
<p>[Your stake for this bet is 10,000,000 D-Coins.]</p>
