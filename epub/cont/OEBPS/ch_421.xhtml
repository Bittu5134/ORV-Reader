<hr/>
<p>Countless lightning bolts struck the hall. Amidst the raging aftershock of probability, a battlefield several times larger than Mitra had envisioned manifested in the center of the hall.</p>
<p>[There has never been a story like this.]</p>
<p>Mitra, gazing into the churning void, muttered with a pale face.</p>
<p>[Round Table... are you determined to destroy all my myths...!]</p>
<p>Mitra's expression, once noble, transformed into that of a cornered demon. Sentences of probability poured from the sky like a deluge. They weren't mere interventions from a scribe or a nebula’s forced [Fate]. They were the natural order of the cosmos—the &lt;Star Stream&gt; itself.</p>
<p>[Zeus! Odin! Ra! Nuwa! Fuxi! Can you truly hear me?]</p>
<p>The myth of Mitra's birth and death defied the natural order of the universe, but the impending odds were too powerful for the ancient myth to resist. Mitra's fingertips began to crumble into pale dust. He turned to me, his gaze heavy with humiliation.</p>
<p>[Demon King of Salvation, I may not be able to keep my promise to you.]</p>
<p>With those words, Mitra's incarnation body was enveloped in a blinding halo of light.</p>
<p>"Wait—"</p>
<p>I reached out, but I stopped. It wasn't just Mitra. The surrounding constellations were also being engulfed in identical halos.</p>
<p>[Ah, ah. This is— Light!]</p>
<p>[No! Stop this!]</p>
<p>The constellations of the 'Hall of Golden Dice' were being forcibly transported.</p>
<p>"Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>Beside me, Anna Croft was fading. In the distance, Jung Heewon was running toward me, her form already dissolving into radiance.</p>
<p>"Dokja-ssi!"</p>
<p>And then, the light claimed me too. As I felt the world shift, the realization struck me.</p>
<p>[A 'Giant Battlefield' has been born in 'Valhalla Hall'!]</p>
<p>A distant laughter echoed through the transition—a strange musical note, a soft whisper telling of the beginning and the end of the world.</p>
<p>「Thus, the long festival of the constellations will finally come to an end.」</p>
<p>Along with the records engraved into the Round Table’s universe, the final battlefield of 'Valhalla Hall' was opening.</p>
<p>[From now on, all beings in 'Valhalla Hall' will be summoned to the 'Giant Battlefield'!]</p>
<p>Back when I was writing web novels, I once asked Kiyeon-hyung how to bring characters to life. (Now that I think about it, I’m not sure why I asked him of all people.)</p>
<p>"You have to write as if you were the character," he advised.</p>
<p>"So, do you always write as if you were one of them?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"But all your characters speak strangely."</p>
<p>"What's wrong with my lines?"</p>
<p>"All your characters laugh like 'Heh heh,' don't they?"</p>
<p>"Because I laugh like that, too."</p>
<p>Thinking I’d asked the wrong person, I went to Ji Eunyu with the same question.</p>
<p>"You shouldn't empathize with your characters too much," she replied. "If you do, only the writer finds the story entertaining."</p>
<p>"But without empathy, won't they lose their vividness?"</p>
<p>She looked puzzled. "Ultimately, characters are the writer's alter ego."</p>
<p>"So should I empathize or not?"</p>
<p>"You should write so the reader can empathize."</p>
<p>"Do you know who your readers are?"</p>
<p>In the end, I never found the answer. I knew nothing about my characters, and even less about the people who would read them. Once I acknowledged that, I lost my grasp on myself as a writer.</p>
<p>What are characters? Are they creations, or are they independent entities merely borrowing my language? How do I write for people I don't know? Who am I, writing an unknown story for an unknown audience?</p>
<p>"Ugh."</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes, I was met with the pitch-black ruins of what looked like a Buddhist altar. Pillars of light flickered in the distance.</p>
<p>[Ugh, ughhhhhhhh!]</p>
<p>[No! Get me out of here!]</p>
<p>The screams of summoned constellations snapped me back to reality.</p>
<p>「We've entered the battlefield.」</p>
<p>A record flashed through my mind. At times like this, it’s helpful to format your thoughts into sentences—to act as if you were the character in the script.</p>
<p>[Exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall', activates!]</p>
<p>It wasn't hard to grasp the situation. I had suspected something like this might happen from the moment I entered Valhalla.</p>
<p>「In the face of the Great Destruction, it was a miracle that a system like 'Valhalla Hall' had lasted this long.」</p>
<p>For the constellations on the Main Battlefield, Valhalla was a necessary evil. It provided elite soldiers, but it also drained the potential of those who hid there, resulting in a net loss of strength. This scenario was inevitable. However, as Mitra said, the timing was premature.</p>
<p>Was this solely the will of the 'Round Table'? The answer appeared immediately.</p>
<p>[The main scenario has been updated!]</p>
<p>With a tsutsutsu sound, the face of a Great Dokkaebi manifested in the sky.</p>
<p>[I deeply apologize to the constellations who were startled by this sudden development.]</p>
<p>I recognized him instantly.</p>
<p>「Great Dokkaebi Baram.」</p>
<p>His appearance was met with a chorus of indignant roars.</p>
<p>[What is the meaning of this!]</p>
<p>[Summoning us to a battlefield without warning? Is this the Bureau's idea of management?]</p>
<p>[This is a violation of our status!]</p>
<p>This wasn't some low-level scenario; it was Scenario #85. It was a late-stage arena filled with Narrative-grade beings. Their sense of entitlement was absolute.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Impatient Swamp Predator', indignantly points a finger at the Administration Bureau!]</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Gourmet of the Quiet Isle', laments the Administration Bureau's tyranny!]</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Master of the White Castle', surveys the battlefield with displeasure.]</p>
<p>The modifiers were familiar—members of the Gourmet Association. They, too, had been lounging here instead of fighting.</p>
<p>[I understand your grievances,] Baram continued, ignoring the outcry. [However, constellations, we cannot allow this festival to continue indefinitely.]</p>
<p>He surveyed the field with a calm, piercing gaze.</p>
<p>[Is 'Valhalla Hall' truly what you desire? Is it the non-existence you wished for—waiting for others to clear the path while you exhaust your remaining starlight in a cage?]</p>
<p>The resentment subsided for a heartbeat. His words had struck a nerve.</p>
<p>[Have you forgotten the thrill of your first scenario? The memory of your first item? The days you spent accumulating your first stories? Gaining allies, slaying arch-enemies, completing the impossible—have those memories truly faded?]</p>
<p>The story of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; flowed above the ruins.</p>
<p>「"You crazy bastard! If you don't kill, you'll die too!"」</p>
<p>「"It doesn't matter."」</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it was my story.</p>
<p>「The first scenario—the scene of 'Proof of Worth'.」</p>
<p>The stars watched. Yet, what they saw was different for each of them.</p>
<p>「The stars see the same story, yet they each read a different one.」</p>
<p>They were likely recalling their own 'Proof of Worth', their own ancient origins and distinct eras.</p>
<p>[Eventually, all starlight will extinguish, and the universe will return to silence. The moments we cherished will be reduced to a single line, or perhaps nothing at all.]</p>
<p>Like the manager of a failing amusement park, the Great Dokkaebi spoke with somber weight.</p>
<p>[Scenario #85 is a high-level stage, but it is not the end. Burn everything you have. Enjoy the struggle. Pioneer the tale. You are still within the scenario.]</p>
<p>Even without [Incite], Baram’s speech was moving. But some emotions only affect those willing to feel them.</p>
<p>[Is the Bureau calling this a 'scenario' now!]</p>
<p>[Great Dokkaebi! Are you mocking us?]</p>
<p>[I paid a fortune in residence fees for Valhalla!]</p>
<p>[Where is the Chairman? This is a scam!]</p>
<p>[Yes... something that should never have happened has happened.]</p>
<p>Looking at them, I thought of the incarnations who had risen in the New Murim District.</p>
<p>「Some memories possess no power.」</p>
<p>To reach this stage, these stars had survived countless tragedies. They had lost everything and gained the world. And now, at the summit, they were obsessed with a single fear.</p>
<p>「I don't want to fall.」</p>
<p>They didn't want to be eliminated. They didn't want to die. Rather than being remembered as a great line in history, they preferred to remain eternal spectators in the shadows.</p>
<p>[Chairman! Reveal yourself!]</p>
<p>I understood that sentiment. I wouldn't call it wrong. But they had to realize the truth by now.</p>
<p>[Cancel this immediately! What are the Great Nebulae doing?]</p>
<p>The rules of the world they enjoyed were finally being applied to them.</p>
<fieldset>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">[Main Scenario #85 – The End of Sloth]</h3>
<p>Category: Main</p>
<p>Difficulty: ???</p>
<p>Clear Conditions: Survive the 'Super-Large Battlefield' and join the 'Main Battlefield'.</p>
<p>Time Limit: None</p>
<p>Reward: ???</p>
<p>Failure: Death</p>
<p>[Survival Conditions]</p>
<p>—Hunt a 'warrior' stronger than yourself.</p>
<p>—Or hunt five or more warriors of the same rank as yourself.</p>
<p>—Hidden 'sanctuaries' will appear on the battlefield at regular intervals.</p>
<p>[Sanctuary Rules]</p>
<p>—When a Sanctuary appears, a five-minute timer starts.</p>
<p>—After the timer expires, the twenty participants standing within the Sanctuary's light will be transported to the 'Main Battlefield'.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>Amidst the chaos, I read the window. A massive battlefield—the first of its kind in Valhalla history. The goal was simple: survive.</p>
<p>The first condition was brutal. Intermediate warriors had to hunt Advanced-level or higher. Advanced had to hunt Special-level.</p>
<p>The second was no easier: five warriors of your own rank.</p>
<p>The final condition was the only one that seemed feasible for those unwilling to fight.</p>
<p>[My goodness... we actually have to do this?]</p>
<p>[Let me out! I'm telling you to let me out!]</p>
<p>Most of them hadn't participated in a real scenario in eons. They were content to watch incarnations, sustaining themselves on the stories of others. Risking their own lives was a forgotten concept.</p>
<p>[Kill a constellation stronger than me? That's insane...]</p>
<p>Like children in the first scenario, the constellations grew wary, distancing themselves. Some fled into the bushes. Others tried to find strength in numbers.</p>
<p>[Is there any constellation willing to join us?]</p>
<p>[We need a team! If we unite, we can overcome this!]</p>
<p>The first to call out was a high-ranking constellation from the border regions.</p>
<p>[If anyone wants to— Kaaaaaaak! Wait! What are you doing!]</p>
<p>An arrow pierced his shoulder before he could finish.</p>
<p>[Kill him.]</p>
<p>Five or six constellations swarmed from the shadows like lynxes. In an instant, the Great-grade constellation was torn apart, his story disintegrating before he could utter a final word. Their leader bit into the severed arm of the dead star and spat it out.</p>
<p>[Intermediate? Worthless. Find me an 'Advanced' or higher.]</p>
<p>I recognized him immediately.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Black Wolf Reaper', lets out a ferocious howl!]</p>
<p>The Black Wolf Reaper—Anubis, the Narrative-grade constellation from &lt;Papyrus&gt;. I quickly ducked behind cover, checking my status.</p>
<p>[You are currently a 'Special Warrior'.]</p>
<p>My value had skyrocketed after the previous battle. If I were caught, I’d be the ultimate prize.</p>
<p>[Run! It's Papyrus!]</p>
<p>As the wolves led by Anubis roared, the surrounding constellations scattered in a panic. I held my breath, waiting for them to pass.</p>
<p>[There was definitely a scent here...]</p>
<p>Anubis sniffed the air near my hiding spot, but his eyes slid right past me.</p>
<p>[The story, 'Pebble and I', begins its storytelling!]</p>
<p>I was currently nothing more than a stone.</p>
<p>[Hmm. Did I misread the trail?]</p>
<p>I wasn't afraid of them, but now wasn't the time to move. I waited for the pack to recede, but then, a hand tapped me on the shoulder.</p>
<p>It should have been impossible. Under the effect of 'Pebble and I', I was undetectable.</p>
<p>Unless... there was only one person who could find me like this.</p>
