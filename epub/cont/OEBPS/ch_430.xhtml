<hr/>
<p>[Again, I must disagree.]</p>
<p>Mitra’s skepticism was palpable. He looked at me as though I were a naive child, then heaved a deep sigh.</p>
<p>[I know you are familiar with the concept of 'fear'. But the Outer Gods residing within that thicket are fundamentally different from the fears you have encountered.]</p>
<p>I couldn't exactly tell him I knew those gods personally, so I offered a bitter smile instead. Mitra, perhaps misinterpreting my silence as stubbornness, adopted a grave tone.</p>
<p>[Even if you have ascended to the realm of myth, do not underestimate the 'gods of the other world'. The entities inside that bush are monsters I cannot guarantee a victory against.]</p>
<p>Of course he would say that.</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>[And yet you insist on going?]</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Mitra wasn't wrong; the beings inside would be dangerous. Above all, I had no way of knowing which version of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; existed within that chaotic space.</p>
<p>"I have to go."</p>
<p>However, I had encountered members of &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt; across worldlines before. Shin Yoosoung, Lee Gilyoung—I had even seen other members during my brief time possessing the kkoma Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>Whoever was inside, I was certain of one thing.</p>
<p>「They would never harm me.」</p>
<p>The name itself was &lt;Kim Dokja Company&gt;. Those who had banded together under that banner and endured the hell of the scenarios would never raise a hand against Kim Dokja or his fragments.</p>
<p>[You... truly cherish your comrades.]</p>
<p>Had he doubted my resolve until now? Mitra looked genuinely impressed.</p>
<p>[The 'Sanctuary' will appear soon!]</p>
<p>A system message flashed above my head. The sky tore open with the roar of a thousand constellations, and a pillar of blinding light struck the earth. It was a spectacle reminiscent of Thor’s descent. A shimmering curtain of light formed around the impact point.</p>
<p>[A 'Sanctuary' has been generated!]</p>
<p>A five-minute timer materialized above the translucent barrier.</p>
<p>[Timer initiated!]</p>
<p>[When the timer expires, all participants within the 'Sanctuary' will be transferred to the 'Main Battlefield'.]</p>
<p>A total of twenty constellations could survive within that circle of light. Anna Croft, observing the phenomenon, murmured softly.</p>
<p>"This scenario is rigged for the Giant Nebulae."</p>
<p>I agreed. In a battle for territory like this, only a massive organization could secure and defend a zone for twenty members. The nebula that claimed the 'curtain of light' first would likely win the 'Battle of the Sanctuary'.</p>
<p>Amidst the rising tension, sparks crackled in the air, and a familiar figure materialized. It was a High-grade Dokkaebi I knew well.</p>
<p>[Finally! The 'Sanctuary' has arrived!]</p>
<p>It was Biryu—the dokkaebi who had overseen the Chungmuro scenario in the 1,864th round. He had been dispatched to manage this super-large battlefield.</p>
<p>[But... isn't this a bit unfair if we leave it like this?]</p>
<p>Several constellations muttered in confusion at his ominous tone.</p>
<p>[What do you mean?]</p>
<p>[Don't try anything stupid—]</p>
<p>Biryu snapped his fingers with a mischievous grin. Instantly, the massive curtain of light began to fracture.</p>
<p>[D-don't threaten me! T-This way, the big bullies get all the advantages. If we spread it out a bit... hehehehehe!]</p>
<p>The Sanctuary, designed for group defense, shattered into smaller fragments. It was a scene I knew all too well.</p>
<p>「Green Zones.」</p>
<p>Just like the dozens of Green Zones that had appeared in Chungmuro Station, the effective area of the Sanctuary split into scattered pockets.</p>
<p>[The 'effective area' of the Sanctuary is fragmenting!]</p>
<p>Like the Green Zones, the sizes varied wildly. Some were barely large enough for a single person, while others could fit two or three.</p>
<p>[Some constellations are greatly flustered by the altered scenario!]</p>
<p>[A few constellations are satisfied with the altered scenario!]</p>
<p>In a sense, Biryu's twisted 'fairness' was effective. It made it nearly impossible for a single, massive nebula to monopolize the safe zones. With the territory divided, smaller alliances and individual stars now had a fighting chance. A fierce, chaotic battle for those seats of light was about to erupt.</p>
<p>[Until we meet again, disciple of Jungyeong.]</p>
<p>The first to move was Hou Yi, the Sun Hunter. He claimed a single-person zone, aiming his massive bow at anyone who dared approach.</p>
<p>[The Sun Hunter accepts the challenge of the stars.]</p>
<p>A quiet, deadly aura radiated from him. Seeing the White Arrow nocked on his bow, no constellation dared to rush him. Challenging him now was tantamount to declaring war on the Emperor himself. Several other constellations—likely remnants of the &lt;Emperor&gt; nebula—took up positions in nearby zones, forming a defensive perimeter.</p>
<p>Mitra spoke next.</p>
<p>[Everyone, prepare for the scenario.]</p>
<p>It seemed Mitra intended to use this event to send his subordinates to safety.</p>
<p>[Chairman—]</p>
<p>[I will proceed to the 'Missing Bush'.]</p>
<p>At his declaration, the constellations of the Golden Dice Hall, including Skuld, looked torn.</p>
<p>[Chairman, no! That is too dangerous!]</p>
<p>Anticipating their protest, Mitra offered a benevolent smile.</p>
<p>[We will meet again soon. Survive. Even without me, you are strong enough if you stand together. The protection of the Golden Dice Hall remains with you.]</p>
<p>With that, Mitra ripped off one of his own arms and slammed it into the ground. A brilliant light erupted from the limb, bathing the constellations of the Golden Dice Hall in a protective aura.</p>
<p>[Ohhh...!]</p>
<p>A Myth-grade constellation had sacrificed a part of his own body to create a totem. Under its influence, his subordinates could fight with a fraction of his authority. Mitra turned his massive body toward me.</p>
<p>[Then let us make haste.]</p>
<p>I hadn't expected him to actually keep his word.</p>
<p>"Is it truly alright for you to accompany me?"</p>
<p>Mitra nodded.</p>
<p>[Your courage shames me. As a senior of the Mythical rank, I wish to fulfill my duty.]</p>
<p>It was unexpected, but I had no reason to refuse.</p>
<p>"Then let's go immediately."</p>
<p>War was breaking out over the sanctuaries. It was best to leave before the chaos escalated. I signaled to Jung Heewon and Anna Croft. Just in case, I had Anna carry the unconscious Kim Namwoon, leaving Jung Heewon free to fight if necessary.</p>
<p>"Anna Croft-ssi, take this."</p>
<p>I handed her the tickets I had stashed in my waistband.</p>
<p>"This is..."</p>
<p>"Tickets to the 'Main Battlefield'. Take the one for your friend on your back, too."</p>
<p>These were the tickets I had received from the 'Seeker of the End' before entering Valhalla.</p>
<p>"These are Blacklist Tickets, aren't they?"</p>
<p>"We might need them if things go south."</p>
<p>I couldn't guarantee their safety anymore. If the situation deteriorated, sending Anna and Namwoon to the higher scenario was the safer bet.</p>
<p>Anna examined the tickets closely.</p>
<p>"If I use a Blacklist Ticket, I will enter as part of the Calamity forces."</p>
<p>That was correct. She would be deployed on the side opposing the constellations of Ragnarok.</p>
<p>I smiled.</p>
<p>"Isn't that what you want?"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Your goal is revenge against Asgard, isn't it?"</p>
<p>Her shoulders trembled slightly. She bit her lip, hesitating, before looking me in the eye.</p>
<p>"And you?"</p>
<p>"Me?"</p>
<p>"Which side are you on?"</p>
<p>"Why? Planning to follow me?"</p>
<p>Anna didn't answer. Grateful for her silence, I added:</p>
<p>"You know you have to side with Calamity regardless. That must be the term of your contract with the being who granted you the 'Eye of the Great Demon'."</p>
<p>Her eyes flickered with surprise.</p>
<p>"You knew about that?"</p>
<p>I nodded. The entity who gave her that eye was a key player in this Ragnarok. With their help, Anna Croft would be reborn as a central figure for the Calamity side.</p>
<p>"I will repay this debt. Definitely."</p>
<p>"I look forward to it."</p>
<p>A roar erupted behind us, followed by the clash of steel and magic. The Battle for the Sanctuary had begun.</p>
<p>[I will increase our speed.]</p>
<p>Mitra accelerated with a mantra. He could have moved this fast all along but had deliberately kept the pace slow.</p>
<p>Minutes passed. Finally, a dark, dense thicket appeared on the horizon.</p>
<p>[There it is.]</p>
<p>I sensed several constellations trailing us, but none dared to approach, wary of Mitra’s presence.</p>
<p>[You have located the 'Missing Bush'!]</p>
<p>The thicket was right in front of us.</p>
<p>「Inside, I will find Dansu ahjussi.」</p>
<p>I took a step toward the bush, catching my breath. But the moment I stood before the threshold, the atmosphere shifted. A heavy, suffocating silence descended.</p>
<p>"Mitra."</p>
<p>I turned around. Mitra was watching me. Behind him, Jung Heewon and Anna Croft were trapped in a translucent pillar of light. Mitra's authority, [Prison of Light], had been activated.</p>
<p>[You knew, didn't you?]</p>
<p>Perhaps he had been stalling for time just to prepare this trap.</p>
<p>[That I am a coward.]</p>
<p>I gazed up at him quietly, thinking about the nature of a Myth-grade constellation—a star that has read a single story for tens of thousands of years, endlessly executing its own scenario.</p>
<p>"Didn't you say you wanted to escape the 'Hell of ■■'?"</p>
<p>Becoming a myth in the &lt;Star Stream&gt; might mean becoming the &lt;Star Stream&gt; itself. A being so accustomed to the system that it could no longer exist outside of it.</p>
<p>[That is correct.]</p>
<p>Mitra looked at me with eyes full of sorrow.</p>
<p>[I envy you. I envy the courage to throw it all away and disappear, despite having accumulated such a magnificent story.]</p>
<p>As I suspected, Mitra never intended to help me escape. His motive was simple: use my companions as leverage at the last moment to force a deal.</p>
<p>"What do you want?"</p>
<p>[When you roll the 'dice' at the Round Table... call my name. Just once.]</p>
<p>Mitra spoke with a strange, desperate madness.</p>
<p>[Do that, and I will give you anything.]</p>
<p>What he wanted wasn't escape. He was a star who yearned for ■■ more desperately than anyone else. A being who would sacrifice everything just to witness the final scene.</p>
<p>[Promise me. Call my True Name there. If you do, I will grant you my 'Power of Resurrection'! If you seek the aid of &lt;Veda&gt;, I will grant that too! So—]</p>
<p>"That desire..."</p>
<p>I looked him in the eye.</p>
<p>"Is it truly your will? Or is it the will of the stories that turned you into a 'myth'?"</p>
