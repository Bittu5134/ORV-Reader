<hr/>
<p>The Mythical Circle.</p>
<p>When I first reached the status of 'Mythical', I briefly glimpsed its impossible landscape. But back then, I didn't truly feel like a part of that world. I was a mere visitor—an observer who could witness its scenery but lacked the authority to interfere with its events.</p>
<p>[This is likely the greatest gift I can offer you now.]</p>
<p>A die of iridescent hues ascended from Mitra's right hand, radiating a brilliance that pierced through the gloom.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Lord of December 25th', has transferred his 'Dice of Destiny' to you!]</p>
<p>The die traced a line of light through the air and settled firmly into my palm. The sensation was unsettlingly familiar, as if it had belonged to me from the very beginning. I knew exactly what it represented.</p>
<p>「Mitra has transferred his seat at the 'Round Table of Myths' to me.」</p>
<p>This 'die' was my invitation—my ticket into the Round Table of Mythology.</p>
<p>[When a star reaches the level of myth, they possess a crystal of their own story, condensed to its absolute limit.]</p>
<p>I belatedly realized the true identity of the die spinning in my hand. It was a fragment of a legend, forged at the very moment Mitra first ascended to the status of a Myth.</p>
<p>[You did not attain Mythology through the path of a 'constellation', so you never received your own. Therefore, take mine.]</p>
<p>A low rumble of thunder rolled through the artificial sky as Mitra made his declaration.</p>
<p>[Some constellations are moved by the decision of the 'Lord of December 25th'!]</p>
<p>[The constellations of the nebula, &lt;Veda&gt;, strongly contest the judgment of the 'Lord of December 25th'!]</p>
<p>Mitra looked up at the firmament. Immediately, the heavens fell into a terrified silence.</p>
<p>[The constellation, 'Lord of December 25th', reveals his true nature!]</p>
<p>[The constellations of &lt;Veda&gt; obey the will of the 'Lord of December 25th'.]</p>
<p>He was a being capable of enforcing his own will, even in defiance of a Great Nebula.</p>
<p>What I had now received was the concentrated essence of such a mythical entity, carved from the core of his own story.</p>
<p>[The sacred relic, 'Dice of Destiny', has been acquired.]</p>
<p>Mitra, having surrendered the die, wore a complex expression of deep regret and profound relief. I realized that now was the time to seek an honest answer from him.</p>
<p>"Mitra, what exactly is the 'Round Table'? And what purpose do these dice serve?"</p>
<p>Even in 'Ways of Survival', the 'Round Table' was never specifically described. It was only mentioned as a secret banquet hall where the 'mythical constellations' gathered. Since even the original Kim Dokja had never been invited, I was woefully lacking in information.</p>
<p>[The Round Table is the place where the fate of the world is decided. And only those who hold the dice have the right to interfere with that fate.]</p>
<p>Mitra gazed silently at the sky, as if reading the constellations written across the void, and added:</p>
<p>[Only the chosen mythical constellations may enter the Round Table banquet. There, they manipulate the ultimate probability of the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.]</p>
<p>"Is it really alright for you to give me something so significant?"</p>
<p>[It doesn't matter. I have no desire to return to that table. Even if I did, there would be little left for me to do. But for you... it may be different.]</p>
<p>Mitra smiled weakly and began to help his fallen subordinates to their feet. One by one, the constellations of the Golden Dice Hall regained their strength, bolstered by Mitra’s grace.</p>
<p>[If you truly seek the ■■ of all these stories, you will eventually have to pass through that hall.]</p>
<p>He spoke with a weariness so heavy that the entire scene felt like a retirement ceremony.</p>
<p>"Are you no longer curious about your own ■■?"</p>
<p>[Is there any constellation that does not wonder about the end?]</p>
<p>"Then why give me the dice?"</p>
<p>Every star exists only to reach the final conclusion of all stories. Born for that purpose, they cannot help but exist for it.</p>
<p>Yet Mitra had just laid down the only tool that would allow him to participate in that final gamble.</p>
<p>[When I first chose to remain in 'Valhalla Hall', many thoughts crossed my mind.]</p>
<p>The harsh radiance emanating from his form had dimmed. He was no longer using coercion; he was simply speaking the truth.</p>
<p>[A desire to avenge my defeat. A desire to punish the 'Round Table' for discarding me. I wanted to shake the Star Stream once more by becoming the center of a new legend.]</p>
<p>"And now?"</p>
<p>Through the die, I could vaguely sense the weight of Mitra's history.</p>
<p>Mitra, who had lost his duel with 'Snowfield Kim Dokja' and was relegated to the master of 'Valhalla Hall'. I saw the history of a god who managed the lesser stars and witnessed countless desperate competitions.</p>
<p>After a brief pause, Mitra continued.</p>
<p>[Once you ascend to the level of myth, you stop looking back at trivial stories. Unless it is a Giant Story, you rarely pay attention. You spend all day consumed by a stagnant laziness, reliving your own glory over and over again.]</p>
<p>To complete a world is to close the door to it and become a prisoner. To complete a myth is to imprison oneself within that legend.</p>
<p>In that sense, all the 'myth-grade constellations' at the pinnacle of this world were captives of their own stories.</p>
<p>[While staying in this hall, I was finally forced to look back at the stories of others.]</p>
<p>Amidst that stagnation, an unexpected opportunity had presented itself to him.</p>
<p>[I was imprisoned in Valhalla, but in a sense, I was also liberated from my own narrative. Because I was forced to witness the stories of those beneath me.]</p>
<p>There, Mitra had watched countless incarnations and stars perish in the arena.</p>
<p>[I remember one match in particular. It was a game where a Transcendent appeared.]</p>
<p>"Which Transcendent was it?"</p>
<p>[A famous one. However, it wasn't the Transcendent who caught my eye. It was another incarnation on that team.]</p>
<p>It was a team led by a Transcendent, yet his attention had been drawn not to the powerhouse, but to a different incarnation.</p>
<p>"He must have been exceptionally strong then."</p>
<p>[No, he wasn't as strong as the Transcendent. He wasn't weak, per se, but he lacked the exceptional talent that would normally attract the gaze of a god.]</p>
<p>It was a peculiar admission. An incarnation, neither as strong as a Transcendent nor possessing special genius, had captivated a Myth. Why?</p>
<p>[It was a consistently hopeless match. The enemy team was far too powerful, and the Transcendent's team was decimated in minutes. The Transcendent was surprisingly resilient and put up a desperate fight, but that was all. It was a battle whose outcome was already written.]</p>
<p>The picture was forming in my mind. If a Transcendent of that caliber had lost, their opponent must have been a 'Giant Nebula'.</p>
<p>And even that Transcendent had died in the end.</p>
<p>Even though it was just a retelling of a past match, I felt a pang of regret, wondering if the Transcendent was someone I had once known.</p>
<p>[Still, that incarnation refused to give up.]</p>
<p>"He didn't?"</p>
<p>[He ran desperately, knowing there was no chance of victory.]</p>
<p>"I assume he was searching for the prophecy."</p>
<p>With a prophecy in hand, there is always a chance to turn the tables, no matter how unfavorable the odds. But Mitra shook his head.</p>
<p>[That was beyond his reach. He just kept running, losing an arm, then a leg. One of his eyes was gouged out, and every nerve in his body was charred by lightning.]</p>
<p>Just the description was enough to convey the horrific reality that incarnation had faced. His determination to survive seemed as iron-clad as Yoo Joonghyuk’s.</p>
<p>"Was his tenacity what impressed you?"</p>
<p>[No. Anyone can run when their life is on the line. It is a primal instinct.]</p>
<p>That was true. Everyone values their own existence. Some are overwhelmed by despair and surrender, while others cling to a fraying hope.</p>
<p>But the incarnation in the story wasn't trying to protect his own life.</p>
<p>[He was shielding a child in his one remaining arm.]</p>
<p>I forgot to breathe for a moment, my focus entirely consumed by the narrative.</p>
<p>[As you know, it is not easy to reach Scenario #85 and still fight to protect someone else.]</p>
<p>No matter how noble your start, those who reach Scenario #85 usually have their psyche worn down to nothing. Their emotions are frayed, and they lose the ability to care for anything but themselves.</p>
<p>"I take it the child was his own?"</p>
<p>[No. There was no blood connection between them.]</p>
<p>It was a strange story—a truly bizarre tale, yet one that didn't sound entirely foreign to me.</p>
<p>Because in that moment...</p>
<p>"What happened to that incarnation?"</p>
<p>I already knew who that man was.</p>
<p>[He succeeded.]</p>
<p>My heart hammered against my ribs. "He succeeded." That was how Mitra had phrased it. It was a strange way to describe the outcome of a skirmish, which usually ended in 'victory' or 'defeat'. But Mitra said he 'succeeded'.</p>
<p>[He ran until he broke through the boundaries of the arena. He escaped the prison of the scenario that held him captive.]</p>
<p>A high-pitched ringing echoed in my ears. Finally, unable to contain it, I asked.</p>
<p>"By any chance... was that incarnation's name 'Lee Dansu'?"</p>
<p>Mitra paused, considering the name for a long moment.</p>
<p>[Is he familiar to you?]</p>
<p>I nodded with great difficulty. Suppressing the storm in my chest, I forced out the next question.</p>
<p>"Yes. What happened to him after his escape?"</p>
<p>[I do not know. He vanished beyond the reach of 'Valhalla Hall'.]</p>
<p>I tried my best to steady my breathing. Still, I couldn't mask the raw emotion welling up within me.</p>
<p>「Dansu ahjussi is alive.」</p>
<p>He had fought the constellations, fled, and eventually—with a child in his arms—found the 'Missing Bush' and escaped the skirmish.</p>
<p>[I still recall his response when the enemy constellations asked why he was so protective of that child.]</p>
<p>For a heartbeat, I could almost hear the vivid, gravelly voice of Dansu ahjussi.</p>
<p>「"To you who ask why I must protect this child—even if I told you my reason, you would never understand."」</p>
<p>I felt breathless. It was unmistakable. It was Dansu ahjussi. Even after eight years, he was still the same man I remembered.</p>
<p>[There is a sentence left by the recorder who watched over him until the very end.]</p>
<p>A line of text manifested in the air, pulsing with a faint light.</p>
<p>「Those who protect their hearts to the very end may know the truth of the world without ever seeing its ■■.」</p>
<p>I thought about Dansu ahjussi. A man who had been searching for his daughter, Jiyoon.</p>
<p>His daughter was trapped in Asmodeus's theater. So, if he was protecting a child now... who was it?</p>
<p>[And strangely enough, after reading that man's story, the original values within me shifted.]</p>
<p>"Changed?"</p>
<p>[I know it sounds absurd. That a star who has reached the level of myth could suddenly change after reading the story of a single human.]</p>
<p>Mitra continued, speaking as if he knew I wouldn't believe him.</p>
<p>[For a constellation that has lived for eons to change the direction of its light simply by reading a story... even I find it difficult to fathom.]</p>
<p>He was right. This wasn't just true for constellations, but for humans as well. Very few beings have their lives altered by a single narrative.</p>
<p>「And yet, I know full well that such a story is not impossible.」</p>
<p>I already knew of several constellations that had read a story, loved it, and changed the course of their existence because of it.</p>
<p>And Mitra, too, was looking at the stars following him with a gaze similar to the ones I knew. They were the stars gathered in 'Valhalla Hall'.</p>
<p>[Actually, I hadn't made up my mind until then. But now, I have. The other myth-grade constellations may call me a loser or a coward. I don't care. I no longer seek the approval of the Round Table. I don't care if the universe laughs at my choices.]</p>
<p>The stars of the 'Hall of Golden Dice'—stars from countless different nebulae—had decided to abandon their affiliations to follow him.</p>
<p>Mitra looked at them and spoke softly.</p>
<p>[I still wonder about the ■■ of this world. But I have chosen not to be the one who confirms it.]</p>
<p>The dice in my hand vibrated with warmth.</p>
<p>Dansu ahjussi wasn't Kim Dokja. Yet, perhaps, he had accomplished something even more incredible. He had lived his life to the fullest and protected what was precious.</p>
<p>[I intend to escape this '■■' hell with those who follow me. Just as that man once did.]</p>
<p>Ahjussi had succeeded in changing the starlight of a Great Myth.</p>
<p>Mitra, with a faint, knowing smile, spoke as if he already knew my next move.</p>
<p>[Now, I will tell you where the 'Missing Bush' is located.]</p>
